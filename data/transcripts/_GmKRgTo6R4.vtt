current funding for special education
 
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 align:start position:0%

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 align:start position:0%
with that we call on representative
 
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
Heath the prime sponsor of this Bill
 
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 align:start position:0%

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 align:start position:0%
um it's nice to kind of be here I don't
 
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 align:start position:0%
do this very often um my name is Mary
 
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
Heath and I represent um the city of
 
00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 align:start position:0%
Manchester and specifically WS 2 4 5 and
 
00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
7 um I have been a longtime educator
 
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
actually I was an educator for over 42
 
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
years and once upon a time a long long
 
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
time ago I was the first special ed
 
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
teacher at Memorial High School after
 
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 align:start position:0%
94142 was passed so my history with
 
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
special ed goes back a long long way and
 
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 align:start position:0%
I've served in a number of different
 
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
capacities at the local level at the
 
00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 align:start position:0%
state level at the department of Ed and
 
00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
when I worked at Southern New Hampshire
 
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
University as um in the capacity of of a
 
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
teacher Ed program so um House Bill 1176
 
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
is designed to look at a few things but
 
00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
most specifically the funding and and
 
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to take up the time
 
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
because I know you have a big agenda
 
00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
today and I have U that there are people
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
here that will speak to the report that
 
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 align:start position:0%
I just handed out um and also the need
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
for us to look at special education but
 
00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 align:start position:0%
more specifically the whole funding
 
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
issue and in the report you'll have
 
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see those issues and the urgency
 
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
that we really need to start thinking
 
00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 align:start position:0%
and talking
 
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
about what can we do in the near future
 
00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
to really compensate school districts
 
00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 align:start position:0%
for the extraordinary cost that they've
 
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
had and we certainly know that uh the
 
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
old catastrophic Aid is quite a hurdle
 
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
for school districts to get even get
 
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
through that program you don't get the
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
money till the next year um and if you
 
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 align:start position:0%
have a student come in with huge costs
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
if you're a rural School District it's a
 
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
nightmare and the other all our kids
 
00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 align:start position:0%
deserve the best possible education that
 
00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 align:start position:0%
they can get and for families in our
 
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
state in a small rural School District
 
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
to be ostracized and intimidated because
 
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
they have a child with a severe
 
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
disability because of the cost is unfair
 
00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 align:start position:0%
and not right and we need to come up
 
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
with some way to keep that from
 
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 align:start position:0%
happening um I I never even realized
 
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
something something like that could
 
00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 align:start position:0%
happen because I had worked in
 
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
Manchester but when I went to work in a
 
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 align:start position:0%
small rural school district and we were
 
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
at a town meeting and I heard complaints
 
00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 align:start position:0%
about a particular family and the cost
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
for a student their their child there's
 
00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
no parent us to have a severely disabled
 
00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
child and but they still we still need
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
to adhere to the law and we still need
 
00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
to do the best for those children that
 
00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
we can do so I'm going to end there
 
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
because I can go on for hours because
 
00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
this subject has been eny of my heart
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
for a long long time um because all kids
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
and you know I loved what Dean said
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
yesterday when he a capital l capital a
 
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
capital l l um because really all kids
 
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
deserve an education and all kids can
 
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
learn to some extent so you know we are
 
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
really invested in our kids in New
 
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we need to do a better job
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
so I am going to stop if unless you want
 
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
me to answer any questions but the
 
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
experts are behind me thank you very
 
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
much are there any questions for
 
00:07:33.309 --> 00:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
representative Heath yes representative
 
00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
Miler uh thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
you for being here uh you cited the
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:42.879 align:start position:0%
94142 would you please review that
 
00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
because there are members of this
 
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
committee who are not I'm ass sure sure
 
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
are not familiar with the impact of that
 
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.120 align:start position:0%
and what it meant uh for special ed
 
00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
students um and I'm sure Jen can do a
 
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
better job than I will do but um in in
 
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.309 align:start position:0%
better job than I will do but um in in
um

00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
1975 um the
 
00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:07.639 align:start position:0%
um US Congress and Senate uh passed idea
 
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:10.120 align:start position:0%
which uh the individuals with disability
 
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
Education Act and when that happened it
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
required each School District to look
 
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
independently at each child that was
 
00:08:20.149 --> 00:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
referred for special education and then
 
00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
to come up with a an individual
 
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
education plan and then to provide the
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
necessary education and supports for
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
that child um when I first began um my
 
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
program at Memorial High School really
 
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
nobody really knew what special ed was
 
00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:39.919 align:start position:0%
and I remember the principal way back
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
long ago um I had a student in a
 
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
wheelchair and she needed to take typing
 
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.790 align:start position:0%
wheelchair and she needed to take typing
and

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
typing before we had computers so I'm
 
00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:52.839 align:start position:0%
really dating myself but the principal
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
would not move the class upstairs for
 
00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
her so her mom and I unfort Al had to go
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
to the superintendent and explain Mr so
 
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
and so you know we need to do this well
 
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:07.160 align:start position:0%
anyway Memorial High School got an
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
elevator so it worked out well but there
 
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
are things that that there was a lot of
 
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
reticence um I remember the principal
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
said well I'm not going to turn my
 
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
school upside down for one student but
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
the thing is every child needs to have
 
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
that opportunity and
 
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
94142 made that possible um it's it's
 
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
been it's come a long long way um those
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
folks that are full-time people now know
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh the complexities that go along with
 
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
um special education uh at the
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
department of Ed we don't have as many
 
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
people as we used to have I don't know
 
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
why there used to be a lot of um a lot
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
more uh uh specialed uh Consultants that
 
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
would work with school districts but I
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
guess it's been hard to find people to
 
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
do that job because the cost is so great
 
00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:55.959 align:start position:0%
but at any rate so that's that's what
 
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
idea is um 94142 and kind of made a big
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
difference and made us look differently
 
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
at our school system but most
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
importantly everybody gets to go to
 
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
school and a long time ago a lot of kids
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
didn't get to go to school the
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
difference is wonderful and you know
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
just being a teacher and watching um a
 
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
child um with Down Syndrome walk across
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
the stage when they graduate a child
 
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
that appear I had a student at Memorial
 
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
High School whose mother never thought
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
that he would live very long but he
 
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
lived long enough to get married and
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
have children and have a business of his
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
own and she to drive a car she was so
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
excited the day that he got his license
 
00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:39.639 align:start position:0%
so the these are things that for so many
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
students we never thought that they
 
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
could do these things and they can
 
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely we we can never put box
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
around a student and say they can't
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
because you know what we all can come
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
out and do what we what what we can get
 
00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
to different places so is that enough
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
follow follow up please yeah and and
 
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
with the federal enactment of
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
94142 what was the Federal obligation to
 
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
fund that's a long story
 
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
um that was going to be the the federal
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
government was going to pay 50% and I
 
00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
think I'm not sure what it is now what
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
5% right around 5% and it really it has
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
had a huge impact on school districts
 
00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:27.639 align:start position:0%
and I'm if any of you go to town
 
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
meetings you probably hear the
 
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
conversations that go on the
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
conversation should be about what can we
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
do for our kids not how much it's going
 
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
to cost all the time and I know we have
 
00:11:40.509 --> 00:11:40.519 align:start position:0%
to be leery about cost but still the
 
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
child should be the the focus point of
 
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
our conversation and how we can help
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
them to become what we never thought
 
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
that they could become and and to do the
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
and they'll become citizens and our and
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
be a taxpayer so you know it's just they
 
00:11:59.470 --> 00:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
need those and the state pays a certain
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
percentages and Zach's going to talk a
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
lot about that this morning so I'm going
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
to I'm going to stop talking because I
 
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:07.720 align:start position:0%

chair
 
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned uh the focus
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
specifically of this commission is on
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
funding not completely okay I maybe I
 
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
misunderstood what um if you read
 
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
through the the the whole thing it's
 
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at right I I I saw
 
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
the um the commission shells right
 
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
because so many of our
 
00:12:45.189 --> 00:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
students right could I maybe I can ask
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
my question first okay go ahead thank
 
00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:51.110 align:start position:0%
my question first okay go ahead thank
you

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
um on lines um five and six you talk
 
00:12:59.230 --> 00:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
about um study specific Revenue sources
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
um on page two Roman five you talked
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
about current funding
 
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
sources and you even talk about on um
 
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
the uh last page um this commission to
 
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
come up with a draft proposal for future
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
funding legislation yes um I'm concerned
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
um about this commission and especially
 
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:26.680 align:start position:0%
looking at the makeup of this commission
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about um
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
these people coming up with legislation
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
for funding special ed um could you
 
00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
explain um why you think that that has
 
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
to be the focus of it and we already I I
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
see you handed out a um a report from
 
00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:46.829 align:start position:0%
see you handed out a um a report from
one

00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:50.839 align:start position:0%
organization um that's also involved in
 
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
this uh commission so I'm not sure I'm
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
concerned about one um coming up with
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
legislation for funding and two the
 
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
makeup of the commission um seems um uh
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
slanted if I could say um given uh who's
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
on the commission uh could you speak to
 
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
to those concerns well when we put the
 
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
uh membership together um I worked with
 
00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
the um uh across the street and we
 
00:14:24.509 --> 00:14:24.519 align:start position:0%
talked about who might be on it um we we
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
also talked about the fact that when the
 
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
education committee took the bill um
 
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
that you may have some other ideas of
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
folks you might want to have on the
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
committee um but the fact is we we you
 
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:37.720 align:start position:0%
see that we do have a number of
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
representatives and Senators so I think
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
it's important some of the people are
 
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
that are listed one special educator
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
appointed by the different um
 
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
organizations um so I think this is a
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
commission that's going to take some
 
00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:52.279 align:start position:0%
time but if you have other people that
 
00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
you feel or um people that that
 
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be on there um it's your
 
00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:00.839 align:start position:0%
purview to um make some amendments but
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
um what I'd like to ask is that that you
 
00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:06.279 align:start position:0%
listen to the folks here uh behind me um
 
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
and and hear what they have to
 
00:15:12.509 --> 00:15:12.519 align:start position:0%
say thank you any other
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:39.749 align:start position:0%
 
berson

00:15:39.749 --> 00:15:39.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Jane berson
 
00:15:43.949 --> 00:15:43.959 align:start position:0%
bullu and I'm the executive director for
 
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association of special
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
education administrators and I'm here
 
00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
representing over 270 leaders in the
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
field of special education from both our
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
Public School settings as well as our
 
00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
approved private special education
 
00:16:00.749 --> 00:16:00.759 align:start position:0%
schools many of which have uh
 
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:03.160 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment Centers and we're
 
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
here um to testify in support of the
 
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
bill and I'll keep my uh comments um
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
short you'll see in my testimony uh Mary
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
had done a nice job of kind of setting
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
the stage about the requirements that
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
all of our educational communities are
 
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
held to when it comes to uh provision of
 
00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:24.839 align:start position:0%
special education services for students
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
with IEPs um the other thing that I
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
would add to um
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
representative um Mary Heath uh comments
 
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
is that um our educational communities
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
are responsible for children ages 3 to
 
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
22 um so it it's bigger than your
 
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
traditional uh Public School setting
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um as I have mentioned
 
00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
in in previous uh testimony the costs uh
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
for special education services continue
 
00:16:57.309 --> 00:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
to rise the number of students
 
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
identified um as students with IEPs
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
continues to grow and um the complexity
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
of our students continues to grow which
 
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
really drives up the costs the costs are
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
typically based on um specialized
 
00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
instruction specialized in equipment
 
00:17:14.439 --> 00:17:15.590 align:start position:0%
instruction specialized in equipment
Staffing

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
Staffing
 
00:17:18.029 --> 00:17:18.039 align:start position:0%
transportation we provide services to
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
students with IEPs and Charter Schools
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
we cover the cost for students who are
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
placed out of district and out of state
 
00:17:27.309 --> 00:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
and for those students with IEPs who are
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
engaged in the juvenile justice
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
system we our association really feels
 
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
that this bill would have the
 
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to dig deeper and looking at
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
the costs associated with special
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
education the funding sources coming in
 
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
and would be an opportunity to hopefully
 
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
come up with um some suggestions for
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
consideration in addressing uh the
 
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
challenges when it comes to funding for
 
00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039 align:start position:0%
special education and some of the
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
inequities that we see uh within our Ed
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
educational communities across the state
 
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
um so thank you very much for the
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%

uh taking question um can you I know
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
that the catastrophic Aid which were
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
what it was formerly called covers the
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
the largest
 
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:31.240 align:start position:0%
uh amounts that have to be there can you
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
explain to me a little bit about is
 
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
there any percentage or is it is it
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
covered completely how are those kind of
 
00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
costs covered and I don't have the exact
 
00:18:43.149 --> 00:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
number but once um a students uh the
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
cost for a students reach um a certain
 
00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
cap the department of Ed takes over the
 
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:51.640 align:start position:0%
costs um we've seen that the the
 
00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid going to school
 
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
districts um over the years has gone
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
down um because uh um of changes in
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
paperwork or uh procedures not being uh
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
followed correctly so if the paperwork
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
isn't done correctly from my
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that districts
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
don't uh get their the monies
 
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919 align:start position:0%
that that there should be allotted so
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
there's been some challenges and those
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
numbers have gone down and I don't have
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
the figures right with me does that
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
help thanks representative
 
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.870 align:start position:0%
help thanks representative

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
Damon
 
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thank you for taking
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
my question and being here could you
 
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
just summarize for those of us with not
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
complete background in special
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
ed the additional preparation that a
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
special educator special ed educator
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
would have and perhaps address why that
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
commission those who are seeking special
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
education teacher degrees um you know
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
their their programming is really
 
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
focused on the unique Learners um and
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
their varying types of disabilities
 
00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:09.919 align:start position:0%
typically um those who are entering the
 
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
field of special education get an
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
endorsement called General special
 
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
education um and pretty typically
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
through their career um add on to that
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
and get additional endorsements that
 
00:20:24.669 --> 00:20:24.679 align:start position:0%
specialize in specific disabilities so
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
you could have um an endorsement in
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
learning disabilities emotional and
 
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.230 align:start position:0%
learning disabilities emotional and
behavioral

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:31.240 align:start position:0%
behavioral
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
disturbances uh intellectual
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
disabilities um most of our special
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
Educators tend to specialize once they
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
follow do we have an excuse me do we
 
00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
have enough people in New Hampshire with
 
00:20:59.070 --> 00:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
that credentialing and training and if
 
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
not perhaps you could comment on your
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
perspective on why
 
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
not uh CR in New Hamshire special
 
00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
education teachers is a critical
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
shortage area which means we um are
 
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
desperately um lacking staff um just
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
about every school district um and I I
 
00:21:21.549 --> 00:21:21.559 align:start position:0%
don't have the numbers off of my top of
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
my head but we have many many vacancies
 
00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to special education
 
00:21:27.279 --> 00:21:28.549 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to special education
teachers

00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
um even more vacancies when it comes to
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
speech language Pathologists School
 
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
psychologists OTS
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
pts um paraprofessionals is even more
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
significant um we we don't have the
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
amount of par support that we need in
 
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
our school districts um reasons why um I
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
when we talk to the field I think it
 
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
it's very it's an extremely difficult
 
00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
job the kids are are um very complex so
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
not only are you responsible for the
 
00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:05.799 align:start position:0%
instruction and the specially designed
 
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
um instruction and related Services
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
you're also responsibility you're
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
responsible for all of the paperwork
 
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
that goes along with that and and the
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
timelines which are all important and
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
need to be there um but it's it's above
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
and beyond a typical teachers job in
 
00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
addition um as I mentioned the kids are
 
00:22:30.669 --> 00:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
getting much more complex and difficult
 
00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing a lot of kids with um
 
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
mental health challenges um we're really
 
00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:39.559 align:start position:0%
focusing on violent and aggressive kids
 
00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
um our association is really working
 
00:22:45.149 --> 00:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
with leaders to begin to address that
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
looking at the legal aspect looking at
 
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
the programming aspect and looking at
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
the the training aspect in addition for
 
00:22:55.149 --> 00:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
these kids that um are very very
 
00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
complex all of the placements are full
 
00:23:01.269 --> 00:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
there we're lacking placements for
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
students to go um when we can't provide
 
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:08.200 align:start position:0%
programming within our own districts um
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
so it's there's many layers to the
 
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
challenge and we're also finding that
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
because of all these complexities in in
 
00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:18.799 align:start position:0%
special education the pipeline going
 
00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
into the field in our colleges and
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
universities for special
 
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
EDS is dropping
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
significantly um you know in talk with
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
Keen State College they were one of our
 
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
leaders in terms of special education
 
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
teachers and and years ago it would be
 
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
typical for you know to have 125 150 um
 
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
I think last year they had
 
00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
15 um so it's it's a it's a a field
 
00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:48.710 align:start position:0%
15 um so it's it's a it's a a field
that's

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
difficulties th thank you representative
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
corello and then representative Hall
 
00:24:00.029 --> 00:24:00.039 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question you referred to um
 
00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:08.039 align:start position:0%
the number of IEP students continuing to
 
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
grow just now you're talking about
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
increased complexity of the problems to
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
what do you attribute these increases
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
you know I think there's several factors
 
00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
um you know one is covid we were seeing
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
a a big influx of very young children
 
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
with complex needs who um lost a a huge
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
amount of uh socialization and
 
00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
programming um at very young ages um
 
00:24:39.389 --> 00:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
and so I we feel as though that's one
 
00:24:42.389 --> 00:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
area the mental health challenges and
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
the numbers of kids being
 
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
identified um as having emotional um and
 
00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
behavioral disorders um has risen
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
significantly um the number of kids with
 
00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
autism um is continuing to grow
 
00:25:00.389 --> 00:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
um and so those are the areas that we're
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
seeing um some pretty significant growth
 
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
and for those young kids a lot of it is
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
around the social emotional piece and
 
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
piece yes follow follow so in answer to
 
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
you talked about more increases um the
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
one thing I'm getting is is you
 
00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned covid any any other reasons
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
just to go a little
 
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
deeper well I think we're seeing more
 
00:25:27.389 --> 00:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
and more kids with mental health issues
 
00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:30.039 align:start position:0%
who are being identified as needing IEPs
 
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
and specially designed instruction and
 
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
behavioral support so um the reason for
 
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
um more the increase in mental health
 
00:25:41.789 --> 00:25:41.799 align:start position:0%
challenges I think that's
 
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:45.640 align:start position:0%
Nationwide um we're seeing um in New
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have a huge opioid
 
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
challenge um we have you know lots of
 
00:25:54.389 --> 00:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
complex family
 
00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
situations um you know the reasons for
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
mental health can be wide and
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
deep thank you very much um we have
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
three more speakers lined up so after
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative Hall if you have a
 
00:26:10.029 --> 00:26:10.039 align:start position:0%
question that could wait until for a
 
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
private conversation in the hallway or
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
if it's a really pressing issue
 
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
specifically related to this bill then
 
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
we will entertain it so representative
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
m b for being here and to answer the
 
00:26:24.389 --> 00:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
question um so recently the commission U
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
recently a few minutes ago uh was
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
referenced character ized as being
 
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
slanted do you think the members on this
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
commission are slanted the you know I
 
00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
felt the a a broad representation and
 
00:26:40.269 --> 00:26:40.279 align:start position:0%
obviously the individuals that are
 
00:26:43.149 --> 00:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
selected um that's all open for
 
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
conversation I think the stakeholder
 
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
groups that are represented probably
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
would have um great input into the
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
challenges that we face and would be
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
able to lead us to the research and
 
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of information that will need to
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.110 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
um representative leus and then
 
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.070 align:start position:0%
um representative leus and then
representative

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
cascaden me oh you okay no I said
 
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
representative leus and then
 
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden yeah
 
00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.190 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden yeah
yeah

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question I
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
want to follow up on the
 
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
paperwork issue and all the paperwork
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
that has to be done and I'm
 
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
wondering a is that federally mandated
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
or is there some way to reduce that and
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
B is that something we can have the
 
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
commission also look at it is federally
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
and state mandated
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
um certainly the commission can look at
 
00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
it I mean it's one piece of
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
documentation in terms of the
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
expectations around special education um
 
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
it's just a part of the game you know
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
when you go into it and you become kind
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
of an expert in the law and timelines
 
00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:03.559 align:start position:0%
and it just just becomes a part of what
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
you do each and every day I was just
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
trying to eliminate a yes thank you I
 
00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
was just trying to eliminate a barrier
 
00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
to people going into that that's I don't
 
00:28:17.549 --> 00:28:17.559 align:start position:0%
think there's any way around it okay
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
that's what I wanted to know thank Youk
 
00:28:21.509 --> 00:28:21.519 align:start position:0%
you representative cascaden thank you
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair um and thank you Jane for
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh when I started as
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
a principal a disruptive student that
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
was uh identifying special ed was a
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
generally a student that was born uh
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
with fetal alcohol syndrome and it kind
 
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
of exploded the building because it was
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
such a different unique behavior that we
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
had not seen in a typical learning
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
disabled child but today um is there any
 
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
data on the number of special ed
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
students who have been born drug
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
addicted and is there a number or data
 
00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
that um um can be identifiable with
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
adverse childhood um experiences because
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
those have both exploded in the field as
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
well as you know but I'm wondering if
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
there's data on
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
that I'm not aware of it but we can
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
certainly you know look at that I'm not
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
quite sure how in-depth we get with IEP
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
teams on medical um kind of challenges
 
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
yeah um but that's an interesting
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
question and we can do some research on
 
00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:27.919 align:start position:0%
that for you
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:29:33.269 --> 00:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you madam chair um thank
 
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
you uh for testifying today um first um
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
three or four years ago uh we passed
 
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
legislation uh to create the opportunity
 
00:29:48.029 --> 00:29:48.039 align:start position:0%
for high-risk pools if you will uh
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
Insurance pools for special education
 
00:29:56.669 --> 00:29:56.679 align:start position:0%
costs um being funded uh from possibly
 
00:29:59.549 --> 00:29:59.559 align:start position:0%
District uh special ed Reserve accounts
 
00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
to make up um the basis for these
 
00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
high-risk pools but to my knowledge no
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
school districts have attempted to uh uh
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
try this to see how it can impact and
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
save costs on the local level do you
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
have any feel for why that is the
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
case you know I don't and maybe if we
 
00:30:24.269 --> 00:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
talk to our superintendence association
 
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
um that's not something that our
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
association has been engaged in follow
 
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
up thank you um welcome perhaps
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
something the something the commission
 
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
could look at but also in relate to the
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
commission function um do you think that
 
00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
the uh commission as as a perspective
 
00:30:48.509 --> 00:30:48.519 align:start position:0%
member um would be hearing from parents
 
00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:50.519 align:start position:0%
um in relation to special education
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
services I I see that um you talk about
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
the bill talks about Services required
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
and and so forth but some of the most
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
memorable testimony that I've heard
 
00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
sitting here as a legislator has been
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
from parents
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
crying crying because they cannot get
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
services for their children um and so
 
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering how that balances
 
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
with the funding nature of this at the
 
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
same time there is a performance audit
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
going on by the Legislative budget
 
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
assistant on special education services
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
being provided by the district um and
 
00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
they are not looking at local operations
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
just maybe you can help me I'm a little
 
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
bit confused between the uh LBA audit um
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
the role of this um commission and also
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
um uh providing um uh opport
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
opportunities for parents to give input
 
00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
and talk about services that aren't
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
being performed because it talks about
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
services that are required but statute
 
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
but nothing that about services that are
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
not being performed for these children
 
00:32:11.039 --> 00:32:12.590 align:start position:0%
not being performed for these children
could

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
you answer that long-winded question for
 
00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
me I'll try um first I was say our
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
association values and recognizes the
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
essential um voice of parents I mean
 
00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
they are so intrical they know their
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
child the best um and they have to be a
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
part of um every aspect of the special
 
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
ed process from start to finish and
 
00:32:38.629 --> 00:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
measuring along the way um we truly
 
00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
believe that and always want parents to
 
00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:45.559 align:start position:0%
be a a voice at the table um in terms of
 
00:32:48.629 --> 00:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
this study versus the legislative audit
 
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
that's going on um the Bureau of special
 
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
education has been kind of keeping us
 
00:32:57.149 --> 00:32:57.159 align:start position:0%
briefed on um some of the activities but
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge um the first phase the
 
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
first phase of the report hasn't become
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
public um so it's hard for me to to
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
comment on that um I would
 
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
see and again it's hard for me to
 
00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
comment if I don't really know the
 
00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
activities of the legislative audit and
 
00:33:19.629 --> 00:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
what some of the findings are um at this
 
00:33:22.029 --> 00:33:22.039 align:start position:0%
point to me this commission would be
 
00:33:25.789 --> 00:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
digging very deeply into uh funding
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
aspects I would hope that parent voice
 
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
would be a part of that and that the
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
commission would be getting um input
 
00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:35.720 align:start position:0%
from parents on variety perspectives of
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
what they're looking at through their
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
data um but to compare the two studies
 
00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:42.039 align:start position:0%
at this point I really can't comment on
 
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
that I'm sure both of them will provide
 
00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
us with uh important information and
 
00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
probably the legislative audit will have
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
um some recommendations and data that
 
00:33:53.789 --> 00:33:53.799 align:start position:0%
will feed the commission and things that
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
they won't have to research which would
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
resource representative
 
00:34:05.789 --> 00:34:05.799 align:start position:0%
Ford my question to thank you for taking
 
00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:08.200 align:start position:0%
my question my question is sort of a
 
00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
followup to what was just asked you and
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
it gets into the causality of the
 
00:34:17.069 --> 00:34:17.079 align:start position:0%
process um I have a somewhat unique
 
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
perspective on this process as you know
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
and my observation of it was that a lot
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
of the contention and frustration is it
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
comes when an IEP is challenged for not
 
00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:35.240 align:start position:0%
meeting the thing and this community is
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
represented by attorneys and therefore
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
the parents feel the need to be
 
00:34:42.589 --> 00:34:42.599 align:start position:0%
represented because they don't contend
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
well with the attorneys and it becomes
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
then legally contentious and a lot of
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
the irritation anger frustration stems
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
out of that particular Nexus uh with the
 
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
parents trying to argue for their child
 
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
and desperate as you know I mean we've
 
00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
all experienced some version of that and
 
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
and then being me met by attorneys then
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
having to lawyer up themselves so the
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
cost goes up and I think part of it is
 
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
in that contention process and the towns
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
of course feel the need to be
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
represented by
 
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys and it just keeps going up and
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
up and
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
up and so the question question is and
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
my question is should we be looking at
 
00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:35.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps the IEP process and how we make
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
a contract to meet the needs of specific
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
children so that it doesn't become such
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
a contentious process I would imagine
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
that maybe some of the cost associated
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
with that would be part of the
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
commission's work I think that the
 
00:35:52.829 --> 00:35:52.839 align:start position:0%
legislative audit is covering some of
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
that and might give us some additional
 
00:35:59.230 --> 00:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
information and um but you know I would
 
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
agree with you that many of the
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
conflicts right now center around lack
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
of services that seems to be a trend in
 
00:36:08.109 --> 00:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
in talking with our department of Ed
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
that um you know we're lacking staff and
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
so there are times when kids aren't
 
00:36:15.069 --> 00:36:15.079 align:start position:0%
getting their services and districts
 
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
know that and parents know it and we're
 
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
all doing our best to Rally around and
 
00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
make those Services up when we need to
 
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
um but it is it is a source of conflict
 
00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome thank you any
 
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
more questions from Miss

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
much I'd like to call on um

portelli representative portelli is a
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
bill good morning everyone and thank you
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
for having me my name is for the record
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
my name is representative Susan pelli I

represent Rockingham District 19 Hampton
 
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
Falls and Kensington although I am not
 
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
an expert in education or special
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
education funding I am an expert on what
 
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
happens when we have Federal mandates
 
00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
that are not funded and the impact on
 
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
our kids and property tax
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
owners and I am here today in support of
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
this bill so that I hope that we could
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
shed some light on what's happening with
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
a topic that affects every single one of
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
us and that is how to re look at special
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
education look at all the aspects of it
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
understand the cost drivers and provide
 
00:37:46.589 --> 00:37:46.599 align:start position:0%
some relief for our property tax owners
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
this is critically important to uh make
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
sure part of the conversation is to
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
include the federal funding that we
 
00:37:58.349 --> 00:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
desperately need for special education
 
00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:00.839 align:start position:0%
services to help reduce our property
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
taxes for our new H struggling New
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and provide for the
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
increasing needs of students with
 
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
special disabilities and I'm sure you
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
all know this but for context in 1975
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
Congress passed a comprehensive law
 
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
protecting and improving the outcomes of
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
children and their families with
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities in 1990 the law was
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
reauthorized and changed to the
 
00:38:32.349 --> 00:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities Education
 
00:38:34.589 --> 00:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
Act or
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
idea the the Ida federal laws that we
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
are mandated to comply with include
 
00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:45.319 align:start position:0%
services that must be provided to
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities in elementary
 
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:50.200 align:start position:0%
and secondary school and I'm sure you're
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
very familiar with all of the different
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
requirements such as IEPs Etc but it
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
does not cover all of the costs these
 
00:38:59.359 --> 00:39:01.030 align:start position:0%
does not cover all of the costs these
federally

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
federally
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
mandated uh requirements are very
 
00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:07.720 align:start position:0%
expensive to administrator and the ieda
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
ACT originally proposed only covered 40%
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
of the cost and that was back in
 
00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
1990 however Congress has never
 
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
appropriated the uh required Monies to
 
00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
come to our cities and towns and this
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
has resulted in an unfunded mandate and
 
00:39:32.349 --> 00:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
it shifts the costs for educating
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
students with special needs to the
 
00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
states and especially our school
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
districts and I think we're seeing that
 
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
impact now in the two small communities
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
that I represent there was currently a
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
revaluation of their property their
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
taxes have gone Sky High due to the
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
revaluation in addition to that um many
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
of the special Education costs are
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
increasing faster than our budget our
 
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
school budgets can
 
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
allow children and taxpayers need to
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
understand what these cost drivers
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
are and alarming 26 New Hampshire Public
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
School Districts spend over
 
00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
25% of their total school budget on
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
special education costs I would like
 
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
this commission to do a deep dive and
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
understand what special education
 
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
instruction needs to include from a
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
federally mandated and state mandated
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
perspective how these Services can be
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
delivered in a more effective manner
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
what are the outcomes and how are we
 
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
measuring success I'd like to look at
 
00:40:52.589 --> 00:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
the ad the exploding administrative
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
costs and see what we could do to make
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
sure we get that under control the legal
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
fees as you have mentioned the legal
 
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
fees are borne by the town and many of
 
00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
these lawsuits uh turn into yearlong
 
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
processes at very expensive cost to the
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
town and of course Transportation which
 
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
is also an incredibly expensive Cost
 
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be um needs to be understood so
 
00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
I come at this from a different
 
00:41:28.109 --> 00:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
perspective I want to make sure that we
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
shed some light and put sunshine on what
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
happens with our special education needs
 
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
we have needs from our parents and our
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
students and we have mandates from our
 
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
federal government that were never
 
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
appropriated the funding appro
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
appropriated funding for it and now our
 
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
cities and towns are stuck in the middle
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
so I would respectfully ask that you
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
please consider this commission to look
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
at all aspects of special education and
 
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
especially the federally uh Fally
 
00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:09.319 align:start position:0%
funding opportunities that we have that
 
00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
our federal delegation needs to make
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
sure they are living up to their
 
00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
expectations so thank you very much I'll
 
00:42:20.109 --> 00:42:20.119 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you very much
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative portelli do you have any
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
written testimony that you to submit to
 
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
the committee oh I I can after this
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for the
 
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
leus do you have any specific ideas for
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
um things that can be changed or
 
00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
eliminated that are federally mandated
 
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily helpful well that's
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
certainly something I hope the U the
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
commission can look at so for example in
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
U New Hampshire and I'm sure you guys
 
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
know all these stats but I was just
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
amazed the total New Hampshire education
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
off operating expenses for 2122 was
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
about $3.5 billion total uh special ed
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
cost expenses were 800 million the
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
federal government and local um local
 
00:43:14.589 --> 00:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
governments only only account for about
 
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
20% of the additional funding and we
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
have about uh 20% of our students or
 
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
300,000 students requiring Special
 
00:43:26.829 --> 00:43:26.839 align:start position:0%
Education Service
 
00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
and of course these costs as you know
 
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
shift dramatically from District to
 
00:43:34.109 --> 00:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
District so the number of students
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
requiring these Services could go down
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
but the budgets can be doubled so it's
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
very important for this commission to
 
00:43:46.549 --> 00:43:46.559 align:start position:0%
take a um objective
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
bipartisan comprehensive look at where
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
we're spending all the all of our
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
dollars making sure the services are
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
delivered appropriately but but then
 
00:43:58.829 --> 00:43:58.839 align:start position:0%
some type of measurement to make sure
 
00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
that these services are in fact
 
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
delivering what they promised thank you
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
questions representative dry thank you
 
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
madam chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
question uh in the request in the
 
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
resolution hcr1 to uh ask our delegation
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
to look into the funding the full
 
00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
funding of federal mandates um if it
 
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
were fully funded how much of an impact
 
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
you think that would have on our state
 
00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
right now uh it would obviously it would
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
have a significant impact the um the
 
00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
budget for the US Department of
 
00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
Education is over $80
 
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
billion so we really need to understand
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
where is that $80 billion going and this
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
is something that I hope the commission
 
00:44:53.069 --> 00:44:53.079 align:start position:0%
plus the resolution will be able to
 
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
address to find out why is it taking
 
00:44:58.510 --> 00:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
taking so long for the federal
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
government to live up to its promise to
 
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
fund appropriately an act they put into
 
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
law in 1990 it would have it would be a
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
game Cher for
 
00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:13.160 align:start position:0%

welcome is this your first time
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
testifying before our

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:37.240 align:start position:0%
you good morning does that work better
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Kristen manman Office of
 
00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
the special education Advocate which was
 
00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.190 align:start position:0%
the special education Advocate which was
created

00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
created
 
00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
um probably more than a year ago but my
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
position was filled uh just a handful of
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
months ago so definitely very heavily
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
involved in work in this field and uh to
 
00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:56.430 align:start position:0%
involved in work in this field and uh to
be

00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
specific work on behalf of families who
 
00:46:02.309 --> 00:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
are seeking special education services
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
that they don't feel like they're
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
getting for their students so we're
 
00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:08.079 align:start position:0%
seeing kind of the the deep in the woods
 
00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
um view of what's happening with special
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
education and I don't want to repeat a
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
lot of the testimony that you've already
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
heard um I just would like to put in um
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
two or three thoughts uh for the
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
committee if we are looking at this
 
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
financing piece one I would tell you
 
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
this is anecdotal at this point because
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
it's just going off of the cases that
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
have come into my office but 50% of the
 
00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
disputes I would say about Services um
 
00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
in special education are really related
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
to vacancies they're not related to
 
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
districts not wanting to provide the
 
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
services um so uh Miss beron spoke about
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
this I would hope that any look at
 
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
finances really looks at um getting
 
00:46:56.549 --> 00:46:56.559 align:start position:0%
better data because it's something we
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
all in this community have to do in
 
00:47:02.549 --> 00:47:02.559 align:start position:0%
terms of data on where all of the um
 
00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
open positions and and it's special
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
Educators but it's also related services
 
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
and I think that's really important to
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
understand because if we dug down at my
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
guess is funding for the special
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
education teachers is you know only a
 
00:47:20.589 --> 00:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
part of and I have no idea at this point
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
what percentage but you know probably
 
00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
not more than half um and the related
 
00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
service providers who are in speech
 
00:47:27.549 --> 00:47:27.559 align:start position:0%
language pathology and occupational
 
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
therapy and mental health um Services
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
School psychologists working through
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
IEPs um is a huge portion of the rest of
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
it it is needed um having these
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
positions open means we're spending the
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
dollars later on because what I'm seeing
 
00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
is the more we have students who don't
 
00:47:50.109 --> 00:47:50.119 align:start position:0%
get the services they need younger even
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
if districts wanted to provide them they
 
00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
don't have a speech language pathologist
 
00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
or they don't have enough of them um
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
speech language Pathologists don't just
 
00:47:59.349 --> 00:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
work on things like articulation they
 
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
work on communication skills for our
 
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
students who are diagnosed with autism
 
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
or mental health um they run social
 
00:48:08.829 --> 00:48:08.839 align:start position:0%
groups they they really help those
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
students to integrate into the life of
 
00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
the school so that at some point
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
potentially with young students the idea
 
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
is to bring some of them off of
 
00:48:17.549 --> 00:48:17.559 align:start position:0%
individual education plans because their
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
needs have been met which would decrease
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
um the need for those Services through
 
00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:23.790 align:start position:0%
um the need for those Services through
age

00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
age
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
22 uh so really looking funding wise at
 
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
getting data
 
00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
on whether these positions are going to
 
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
be filled as Miss beron said I think
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
we're heading into more of a crisis
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
rather than less in that we don't have a
 
00:48:39.309 --> 00:48:39.319 align:start position:0%
pipeline to fill some of the related
 
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
services that that are needed so
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
thinking about creative ways for how are
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
we going to over the next 10 and 20
 
00:48:50.349 --> 00:48:50.359 align:start position:0%
years have those positions filled so
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
that Services can be delivered that
 
00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
would cut down on a lot of the
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
disagreement pieces you it would cut
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
down on some of the the legal costs um
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
for these fights because from the
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
parents perspective they they have no
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
control over whether or not someone is
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
in the position they just know that
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
their child needs services that they're
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
not getting so they're going to enter
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
into that fight for which there may be
 
00:49:14.829 --> 00:49:14.839 align:start position:0%
no solution until we figure out how to
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
get positions filled so um there is
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
there are probably Creative Financial
 
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:21.640 align:start position:0%
ways to to ensure that we have a
 
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
pipeline into those special Educators
 
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
par educators and related service
 
00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
providers and I think that's something
 
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:31.720 align:start position:0%
that um data is is very important to
 
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
gather um
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
annually on open positions in that field
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
and on the the numbers of positions in
 
00:49:42.349 --> 00:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
those fields across the state are they
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
are they increasing are they
 
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
needs that that's probably my most
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
important point in this is really
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
looking at um you know these are dollars
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
now for young children or dollars that
 
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
are ongoing later and so I think that we
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we're really
 
00:50:06.309 --> 00:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
looking at um the efficacy of the
 
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
dollars spent and and making sure that
 
00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:11.240 align:start position:0%
that's built into any committee studying
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
finances I'm happy to take any questions
 
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
if you have them thank you very much
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative Miler thank you madam
 
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
chair and welcome for your first uh
 
00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:23.839 align:start position:0%
hearing here I can recall um the piece
 
00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
of legislation that basically created
 
00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
that position and uh much needed
 
00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:31.160 align:start position:0%
position uh since since is your first
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be before the committee
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
could you give us a bit of a background
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
of your uh special education history
 
00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
that got you to this position right so
 
00:50:43.069 --> 00:50:43.079 align:start position:0%
my history was less in special education
 
00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
actually um I had both a legal
 
00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
background and a background in education
 
00:50:52.789 --> 00:50:52.799 align:start position:0%
not special education per se um I uh was
 
00:50:52.799 --> 00:50:53.430 align:start position:0%
not special education per se um I uh was
a

00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
lawyer practiced for some years in
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
litigation um and then ran a school for
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
about 15 years where as an administrator
 
00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:02.839 align:start position:0%
um in a private school we definitely
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
dealt with IEPs and um working with
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
public school districts on IEP Services
 
00:51:09.549 --> 00:51:09.559 align:start position:0%
we had our own um related service
 
00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
providers within the school so uh those
 
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
pieces all come into play I hope to help
 
00:51:21.789 --> 00:51:21.799 align:start position:0%
um work with families to Advocate and in
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
in some instances you know a lot of it
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
has been solving very longstanding
 
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
disputes with their districts um over
 
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
services for their children we're
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
dealing with a lot of Crisis situations
 
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
where children are you know have been
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
out of school for months or more have
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
been in mental health facilities as a
 
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
long progression of potentially not
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
getting services that they needed that
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
landed them there and we're you know
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
having to walk that back because those
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
children do come back into the schools
 
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
and and there are a lot of costs
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
associated with that so um what I tried
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
to do is use both the educational
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
administrator lens and um background in
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
law not special education law per se um
 
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
to bring some balance to uh solving
 
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
situations for
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
families thank you any other
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
much Mrs M Rani did I say your name
 
00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um with that we call on um
 
00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:33.510 align:start position:0%
thank you um with that we call on um
Becky

00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
Becky
 
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
name uh good morning members of the
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
House committee thank you for hearing my
 
00:52:50.829 --> 00:52:50.839 align:start position:0%
testimony today uh for the record Becky
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
Wilson I am the director of governmental
 
00:52:54.789 --> 00:52:54.799 align:start position:0%
relations for the New Hampshire school
 
00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
boards Association uh for anyone who
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
hasn't worked with me previously prior
 
00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:01.240 align:start position:0%
to taking this position several years
 
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
ago I served as a special education
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
director here in the state for about 20
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
years um nhba supports this bill we'd
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
like to thank the sponsors of this bill
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
for highlighting the need to look at
 
00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
special ed funding and look at the
 
00:53:16.589 --> 00:53:16.599 align:start position:0%
complexities of funding in this state
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
for special
 
00:53:20.829 --> 00:53:20.839 align:start position:0%
education um our public Ed costs as
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
everyone on this committee knows are
 
00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
largely paid by local community
 
00:53:26.589 --> 00:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
taxpayers Through Your local property
 
00:53:30.789 --> 00:53:30.799 align:start position:0%
taxes um and while certainly nhba would
 
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that some immediate relief
 
00:53:35.069 --> 00:53:35.079 align:start position:0%
is needed for our local communities it's
 
00:53:37.349 --> 00:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
also very important that uh this
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
commission is able to take into account
 
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
um the numerous aspects of special ed
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
funding that are not easy to determine
 
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
and not clear in a one-time one fits all
 
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.510 align:start position:0%
and not clear in a one-time one fits all
solution

00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
um we have several long-standing
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
resolutions around speci special
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
education funding uh and as you've heard
 
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
I won't repeat the federal funding
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
obligation has never been met uh while
 
00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
there is a bill currently uh before our
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
federal delegation called the idea full
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
funding act uh whether or not that will
 
00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
pass I think is yet to be seen that
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
would only again um if it were to pass
 
00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
by some small miracle um allow uh states
 
00:54:20.829 --> 00:54:20.839 align:start position:0%
to to get up to 40% of the special
 
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:23.720 align:start position:0%
education costs that they incur uh so I
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
think it's quite
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
if history repeats itself I think the
 
00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
likelihood of that bill going anywhere
 
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
is probably not that not that high but
 
00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
we can always keep trying um and NH hsba
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
certainly supports any full funding from
 
00:54:38.829 --> 00:54:38.839 align:start position:0%
the federal uh government that we can
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
get in terms of meeting their obligation
 
00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
there are a myriad of costs associated
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
with meeting the provisions of idea at
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
the state and federal levels and I think
 
00:54:49.309 --> 00:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
it's very key to remember that New
 
00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:51.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has decided to exceed the
 
00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
federal idea in several areas which also
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
changes cost at the state level um we
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
also fund all of the uh services for
 
00:55:02.589 --> 00:55:02.599 align:start position:0%
students who are eligible for special
 
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
education at Charter Schools the
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
resident district is responsible for
 
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
those costs we to my knowledge New
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the only state that funds
 
00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
specialed at charter schools in that
 
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
manner um the timelines in New Hampshire
 
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
in several areas are shorter than what
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
the federal idea requires so that also
 
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh can have effects on costs in
 
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
districts if you are trying to meet
 
00:55:27.549 --> 00:55:27.559 align:start position:0%
tighter timelines in order to determine
 
00:55:31.069 --> 00:55:31.079 align:start position:0%
eligibility the ability to use staff um
 
00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
becomes more difficult you need more
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
staff to meet shorter timelines uh we
 
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
have higher parental consent
 
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
requirements in some areas than the
 
00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
federal idea also requires which uh
 
00:55:44.589 --> 00:55:44.599 align:start position:0%
leads to more meetings that need to
 
00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
happen in a short period of time which
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
requires Staffing and things like that
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
um it's also I think really important to
 
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
remember that New Hampshire has been at
 
00:55:54.029 --> 00:55:54.039 align:start position:0%
the Forefront of the inclusion movement
 
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
for many many decades um and just
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
because uh inclusion is a more General
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
Ed least restrictive environment for
 
00:56:05.029 --> 00:56:05.039 align:start position:0%
many children does not mean that it is
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
cheaper than providing services in
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
different ways um I ALS districts and
 
00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
specialed admin are in a position to try
 
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:15.640 align:start position:0%
to forecast needs for their Community
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes a year to 18 months ahead of
 
00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
time when they are budgeting the budget
 
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
process in New Hampshire um for school
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
districts most often starts almost a
 
00:56:25.789 --> 00:56:25.799 align:start position:0%
year if not longer in some districts
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
ahead of time trying to predict out uh a
 
00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
three-year-old to 22y Old system 18
 
00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
months out I don't know if any of you
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
have your own children but I can't even
 
00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
predict my own children's needs 18
 
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
months out a year out um those things
 
00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
change over time and a lot of times
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
those costs um that are incurred by
 
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
local districts are being coming off of
 
00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:49.720 align:start position:0%
decisions that are certainly in the best
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
interest of children and are meeting
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
their obligation for idea but we're not
 
00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:55.480 align:start position:0%
budgeted for because there was no way to
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
consider those when the B budget was
 
00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
built the year before um it's a complex
 
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
funding formula for special ed in the
 
00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
state as many of you know you have your
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
base adequacy your differentiated Aid
 
00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:08.200 align:start position:0%
there is special ed Aid or catastrophic
 
00:57:10.109 --> 00:57:10.119 align:start position:0%
Aid you have Medicaid to schools you
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
have Federal Ida grants you have
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
preschool obligations you have tuition
 
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
agreements the number of moving Parts
 
00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools all of those pieces fall
 
00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:21.640 align:start position:0%
into the costs that uh local districts
 
00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
are incurring for special education
 
00:57:23.799 --> 00:57:25.510 align:start position:0%
are incurring for special education
provision

00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
provision
 
00:57:28.349 --> 00:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
um lastly I would like to just remind
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
people that I think um there's a lot of
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
conversation in this committee about the
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
Fidelity of the special education
 
00:57:38.349 --> 00:57:38.359 align:start position:0%
process and concerns about the fact that
 
00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
uh costs may be somehow driven up by
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
funding people want more funding so
 
00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to change the eligibility
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
process for example to try to gain more
 
00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:49.960 align:start position:0%
funding at the local level uh I think
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
nhba would argue that districts are
 
00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
trying to balance meeting their idea
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
obligations and following the processes
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
that are very prescriptive and spelled
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
out in the New Hampshire rules with
 
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
being fiscally responsible for lack of a
 
00:58:08.029 --> 00:58:08.039 align:start position:0%
better term um it's very difficult uh to
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
look at all of those pieces and make a
 
00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
decision as an IEP team about what the
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
students needs are without considering
 
00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
the financial obligation that the
 
00:58:17.789 --> 00:58:17.799 align:start position:0%
district is going to incur by making
 
00:58:19.549 --> 00:58:19.559 align:start position:0%
that decision and that is what we ask
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
teams to do every day is to make
 
00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
decisions that are for individual kids
 
00:58:26.589 --> 00:58:26.599 align:start position:0%
without any concern or consideration of
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
what it's going to cost that is what we
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
are required to do um and the district
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
is then on the hook for making sure they
 
00:58:34.829 --> 00:58:34.839 align:start position:0%
can figure out how to do that um many
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
times as you've heard me say before in
 
00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:37.720 align:start position:0%
front of this committee that is at the
 
00:58:40.029 --> 00:58:40.039 align:start position:0%
expense of the General Ed programming
 
00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:41.240 align:start position:0%
because districts don't have an
 
00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
obligation necessarily to provide all of
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
the things that are in the budget for
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
the General Ed programs but they are on
 
00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:49.480 align:start position:0%
the hook for special ed Provisions um
 
00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
and lastly I would just say uh the best
 
00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:54.200 align:start position:0%
special ed is a very strong regular Ed
 
00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
program I I've heard many people on this
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
committee ask why are the numbers going
 
00:59:00.309 --> 00:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
up if you don't have a strong General Ed
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
program or you have teachers and this is
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
not as um meant negatively towards
 
00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
teachers who are on alternative pathway
 
00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:09.400 align:start position:0%
they've not gone through teacher prep
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
programs General Ed teachers have a high
 
00:59:14.349 --> 00:59:14.359 align:start position:0%
obligation to meet certain aspects of
 
00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:17.240 align:start position:0%
students IEPs if they are coming out of
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
programs where they haven't yet learned
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
those things uh if they are coming from
 
00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
a place where they're on alternative
 
00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
certification process and they have to
 
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
be overseen by people um Regular Ed
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
teachers sometimes may not realize what
 
00:59:32.349 --> 00:59:32.359 align:start position:0%
might rise to the level of a referral or
 
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
what might kick something over into
 
00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
special education so you're going to get
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
a lot more concerns brought forward
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
which some are very valid I'm not trying
 
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
to say that they're not um but if you
 
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
don't have a system that is able to
 
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
provide help to all students and the
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
only way for students to get help is to
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
become identified then certainly you're
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
going to see some changes in that um
 
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's going to drive up your number and I
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
think that um the reason this commission
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
is so needed is that there was many
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
moving Parts like that that I think if
 
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
there was some time given to look at the
 
01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
whole system and look at the system as a
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
whole you might be able to answer some
 
01:00:08.589 --> 01:00:08.599 align:start position:0%
of your own questions on this committee
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
that come up repeatedly about why
 
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
certain things are happening um and the
 
01:00:14.029 --> 01:00:14.039 align:start position:0%
costs then would be much more reflective
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
of true special education need and not
 
01:00:18.349 --> 01:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily systems issues that are
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
happening across certain districts in
 
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
the state um I'm happy to answer any
 
01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.270 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
representative

01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
luus thank you for taking my
 
01:00:32.589 --> 01:00:32.599 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned that in some
 
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
areas were even more strict than the
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations my question is are
 
01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.270 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations my question is are
there

01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
areas that there are that the federal
 
01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
government has um made mandates on us
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
which perhaps are not so useful or that
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
if question yeah I appreciate the
 
01:01:02.079 --> 01:01:04.829 align:start position:0%
if question yeah I appreciate the
question

01:01:04.829 --> 01:01:04.839 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:07.480 align:start position:0%
um without going back in and looking at
 
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
every individual piece of the federal
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
idea I would say that my experience with
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
most federal legislation is it's sort of
 
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
a barebone situation so I would imagine
 
01:01:18.589 --> 01:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
that the majority of idea um
 
01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:21.160 align:start position:0%
requirements are mandatory in order to
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
ensure that students are getting an
 
01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:25.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate free education
 
01:01:29.309 --> 01:01:29.319 align:start position:0%
um across the state thank you you're
 
01:01:32.349 --> 01:01:32.359 align:start position:0%
welcome representative belter thank you
 
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
man Jer uh thank you for your testimony
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to clarify one point that
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
I that was brought up because you you
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the best I believe you
 
01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:43.160 align:start position:0%
said defense against having to expand
 
01:01:46.349 --> 01:01:46.359 align:start position:0%
special education programs is in fact a
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
strong regular education program I'm not
 
01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
sure I fully understood that because my
 
01:01:51.789 --> 01:01:51.799 align:start position:0%
understanding of special education is
 
01:01:54.029 --> 01:01:54.039 align:start position:0%
it's for students with disabilities so
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
that I are you suggesting that education
 
01:01:59.069 --> 01:01:59.079 align:start position:0%
itself can induce
 
01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:01.400 align:start position:0%
disabilities thank you for the question
 
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
um we have 13 categories of disability
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
here in the state every single category
 
01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
has very specific criteria that students
 
01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
must or teams must consider when they're
 
01:02:15.069 --> 01:02:15.079 align:start position:0%
trying to decide whether or not a child
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
is eligible for special
 
01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
education there in any classroom there
 
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
are I'll say 20 students who have 20
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
different learning styles 20 different
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
ways of expressing what they know Etc um
 
01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
for strong regular Ed programs that
 
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
offer for example differentiated
 
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
instruction lots of different ways to
 
01:02:40.029 --> 01:02:40.039 align:start position:0%
show what you know um many students will
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
will be able to show what they know in a
 
01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:44.559 align:start position:0%
very competent way if you only in one
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
room allow one way for students to show
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
what they know and you have a child who
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
that's not their way of showing what
 
01:02:52.029 --> 01:02:52.039 align:start position:0%
they know um it's going to look like
 
01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:55.720 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't know the content so
 
01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
strong regular Ed in New Hampshire has
 
01:02:59.349 --> 01:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
been built off of differentiated
 
01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
instruction a lot of other programming
 
01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
that allows for multiple ways for
 
01:03:05.549 --> 01:03:05.559 align:start position:0%
students to show their competency for
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
example um it allows students who are
 
01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:11.720 align:start position:0%
still struggling to sort of rise to a
 
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
level where there would be a concern
 
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
that is truly based on the students
 
01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
needs versus a break in the system if
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
that makes
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
sense a lack of offerings what the child
 
01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:24.839 align:start position:0%
would need in the first place
 
01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
Excuse me yes follow I made just to
 
01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
further clarify a little bit so let's
 
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
say you have a student who's not good at
 
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
taking tests and they that's their way
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
that's being tested in the classroom
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's a written test and they and they're
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
not performing well but there's not an
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
underlying disability there it's just
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
not a good test taker are you suggesting
 
01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
that such a student could wind up being
 
01:03:44.589 --> 01:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
placed in a special education program
 
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
even though there's no disability
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
present thank you for the question I'm
 
01:03:49.789 --> 01:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
saying that I think in that situation if
 
01:03:54.109 --> 01:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
you had um people with less experience
 
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
at as Educators for example that I'm
 
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
just using this as an example but a
 
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
teacher who is coming from
 
01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
another profession who wants to be a
 
01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
teacher and is on an alternative plan
 
01:04:05.549 --> 01:04:05.559 align:start position:0%
and is supervised by someone else if
 
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:07.720 align:start position:0%
they don't understand necessarily or
 
01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
haven't had
 
01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
experience asking themselves that
 
01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
question if it is the way in which the
 
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
student is being tested that is the
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
issue or if it is an issue in terms of
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
the students learning if they don't have
 
01:04:20.269 --> 01:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
that background they may make a referral
 
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
to special ed it doesn't mean the
 
01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
student would be necessarily identified
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
as needing special education because
 
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:27.640 align:start position:0%
there is a very long process that goes
 
01:04:30.309 --> 01:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
through once that referral is made but
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
schools are not in a position to be able
 
01:04:34.269 --> 01:04:34.279 align:start position:0%
to say we're not taking that referral
 
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
the Ida is very clear that when you get
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
a referral you need to dispose of it you
 
01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:39.319 align:start position:0%
need to meet on it you need to meet with
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
a certain number of days there are
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
certain people that need to be at that
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
meeting that process is started you
 
01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
can't say no thank you so I think you
 
01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
would get to a point where with strong
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
evaluations which is what happens in the
 
01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
special ed process you would determine
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
that it's really a mismatch of um
 
01:04:59.950 --> 01:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
environment versus student actually
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
needing specially designed instruction
 
01:05:03.549 --> 01:05:03.559 align:start position:0%
that is significantly different than
 
01:05:03.559 --> 01:05:04.349 align:start position:0%
that is significantly different than
other

01:05:04.349 --> 01:05:04.359 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
people thank you that was very useful
 
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
information you're welcome thank you any
 
01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.510 align:start position:0%
information you're welcome thank you any
other

01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Miss Wilson thank
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
you and our final speaker is Zach Shen
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:26.109 --> 01:05:26.119 align:start position:0%
correctly thank you thank you members of
 
01:05:29.069 --> 01:05:29.079 align:start position:0%
committee um for the record Zach shien
 
01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director of the New
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school funding fairness
 
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
project as often happens I have in
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
testimony prepared but I after
 
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
everything everyone's saying I I'm going
 
01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
to bounce around because I don't want to
 
01:05:41.309 --> 01:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
repeat a lot I know people have gone
 
01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
through a lot and folks who have much
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
more detailed expertise in special
 
01:05:44.559 --> 01:05:46.349 align:start position:0%
more detailed expertise in special
education

01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:46.359 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
specifically um what I do want to hit on
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
though is kind of the funding um piece
 
01:05:53.269 --> 01:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
that the commission would be looking at
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
um so just a tiny bit of
 
01:05:57.789 --> 01:05:57.799 align:start position:0%
background uh here in New Hampshire we
 
01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:00.200 align:start position:0%
rely primarily on local property taxes
 
01:06:03.789 --> 01:06:03.799 align:start position:0%
to pay for public education total public
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
education about 70% of all um
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
expenditures for public education in the
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
state are covered by local property
 
01:06:12.349 --> 01:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
taxes that's about 60% local property
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
tax 10% swept which as you know swept is
 
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
a local property tax because it's raised
 
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
retained and kept
 
01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
locally um to put some numbers around
 
01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
special education funding specifically
 
01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
um the 21 2022 school year there are
 
01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:28.119 align:start position:0%
about 30,000 students receive special
 
01:06:31.069 --> 01:06:31.079 align:start position:0%
education services um the total costs
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
which have been referenced before for
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
special education services um are around
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
$840 million uh for that same
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
year um and then we've uh kind of
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned a number of times the lack of
 
01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
funding from the federal government and
 
01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
where that plays into this I think it is
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
an important conversation I think that
 
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
hcr1 that was mentioned earlier is an
 
01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate um Step that the legislature
 
01:06:57.069 --> 01:06:57.079 align:start position:0%
can take to demand action of the federal
 
01:06:59.230 --> 01:06:59.240 align:start position:0%
government um but as was pointed out in
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
testimony I think repeatedly last week
 
01:07:03.789 --> 01:07:03.799 align:start position:0%
uh waiting for that when it has not come
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
through in decades I think is not um
 
01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
taking a logical approach to solving
 
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
school funding um for now so I think the
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
HCR is a really helpful approach to
 
01:07:15.309 --> 01:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
asking how that's going to be solved but
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
hoping it comes through when it hasn't
 
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
in the past I think um and contining to
 
01:07:22.269 --> 01:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
Kick the Can down the road currently is
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
is not a helpful approach for our
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
students uh right now um just to give a
 
01:07:31.269 --> 01:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
little um background on some of the kind
 
01:07:33.069 --> 01:07:33.079 align:start position:0%
of impacts on specific school districts
 
01:07:35.549 --> 01:07:35.559 align:start position:0%
it was just mentioned earlier about 20
 
01:07:39.309 --> 01:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
26 uh school districts um it's year 2021
 
01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
2022 had over 25% of their budget was
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
special education cost and this can vary
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
greatly especially for a lot of our
 
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:48.200 align:start position:0%
smaller rural districts um if a student
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
moves in has significant needs that can
 
01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
really change a budget and how why you
 
01:07:55.470 --> 01:07:55.480 align:start position:0%
know why we have a system right now
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
where a family needs to fear tension at
 
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
the grocery store because the community
 
01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
knows that their child is receiving
 
01:08:03.390 --> 01:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
additional services and those are being
 
01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
born primarily by local property taxes
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
like that is a broken system in which
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
families or students are you know
 
01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:12.200 align:start position:0%
feeling penalized as representative
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
Heath mentioned for receiving the
 
01:08:15.269 --> 01:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
services that they are entitled to and
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
that their students need um their
 
01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:19.839 align:start position:0%
children need to
 
01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
succeed relative to um HB 1176
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
specifically uh we think this is an
 
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
important um Bill an important step um
 
01:08:30.829 --> 01:08:30.839 align:start position:0%
towards looking at solving what is you
 
01:08:33.229 --> 01:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
as you heard a very very complex problem
 
01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
I would like to point out specifically
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
the elements that I think um have not
 
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
been touched on uh previously which is
 
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
the funding element so how are we paying
 
01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
for public education at large what are
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
the revenue sources used for that and
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
then specifically with this bill the
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
revenue sources for covering the roughly
 
01:08:52.799 --> 01:08:54.349 align:start position:0%
revenue sources for covering the roughly
680

01:08:54.349 --> 01:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
680
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
million that we are currently raising
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
with local property taxes to cover
 
01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
special education services right so $
 
01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
680 million is the amount that is
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
currently being raised and spent for
 
01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
special education services coming
 
01:09:10.269 --> 01:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
directly out of our local property taxes
 
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
and the way we look at this is this bill
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
provides a few elements I think they
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
were referenced earlier that look at
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
what are potential fund what are current
 
01:09:20.269 --> 01:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
funding sources and what are other
 
01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
potential funding sources for both
 
01:09:26.669 --> 01:09:26.679 align:start position:0%
special ation but at large public
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
education um and I would just encourage
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
you know as a project we would encourage
 
01:09:34.110 --> 01:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
that the commission be explicit in
 
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
looking at Revenue sources all of them
 
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
as many as possible not just property
 
01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
taxes other states we might find that
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
they have different um Revenue sources
 
01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
different specific ways of delivering
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
those revenues to special education
 
01:09:51.149 --> 01:09:51.159 align:start position:0%
funding I would really encourage that to
 
01:09:53.709 --> 01:09:53.719 align:start position:0%
make this a useful and helpful
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
commission to help provide ideally
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
future budget writers in the in the
 
01:09:59.870 --> 01:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
legislature the the resources and tools
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
to try to address this would be what are
 
01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
the other Revenue sources that are used
 
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
and really looking at an expansive
 
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
approach talking about taxes here in New
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is often uh not done frankly
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
and um I think that this provides an
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at what taxes are
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
used in other states why are they used
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
who pays them what's the impact and how
 
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
does that help as we've heard relieve
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
the burden on on local property
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in the state many in rural
 
01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
communities that are really bearing the
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
system lastly um relative to timing I
 
01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
would just um suggest that the timing of
 
01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
this commission reflect the next
 
01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
legislative budget process because I
 
01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
think that is when there is a really
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
significant opportunity to enact some of
 
01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
these changes so we would suggest that
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
that be bumped up a little bit I think
 
01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
the first report is currently as written
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
due end of January 2025 that's a little
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
late for the budget process um I would
 
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
just suggest that it be you know due the
 
01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
end of the calendar year 2024 so that um
 
01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
the governor's office um can be
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
incorporating some of those potential
 
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
changes into their own budgeting process
 
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
and the house waves means and finance
 
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
well um lastly I just wanted to me
 
01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
answer two last questions and I'm happy
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
to answer any remaining questions um I
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
did see that the report that we prepared
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
um was passed out by representative
 
01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
Heath this is something we prepared last
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
October I don't know if this was what
 
01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
was mentioned earlier um relative to the
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
report and folks serving on the
 
01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
commission but I just want to clarify
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
that we as an organization are not named
 
01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
as a participating member in the
 
01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
commission just so that that's clear um
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
I didn't I didn't know which report was
 
01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
being held up in reference to that
 
01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:51.270 align:start position:0%
being held up in reference to that
question

01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
earlier um and then also
 
01:11:57.310 --> 01:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
uh relative to just a number of the
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
questions that have been asked recently
 
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
around what are the services students
 
01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
are getting and how how do we make sure
 
01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
they're getting the services they need
 
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
and I would just encourage this
 
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
commission to not focus entirely on what
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
things can we cut or what things can we
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
reduce or where can we limit pieces in
 
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
order to try to help a little bit that
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
might be helpful in some areas it's
 
01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
definitely good to look at where there
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
are inefficiencies but we're talking
 
01:12:25.229 --> 01:12:25.239 align:start position:0%
about was $700
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
million that is currently being raised
 
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
by local property taxes at wildly
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
different rates to pay for special
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
education services and so making sure
 
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
that this commission as currently
 
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
written looks at what are other Revenue
 
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
sources that could come into the system
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
to help relieve that burden and shift
 
01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
who is paying so that who is paying is
 
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
not Charles stown at a rate of four or
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
five times higher than some of their
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
neighboring communities we're looking at
 
01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
how this impacts different communities
 
01:12:55.229 --> 01:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
specifically and understanding that
 
01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
relying on local property taxes as much
 
01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
as we do is at the at the core one of
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
the major um challenges we're all facing
 
01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm happy to answer uh any
 
01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
questions representative Dr thank you
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
madam chairman thank you for taking a
 
01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
question so the first thing that comes
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
into my mind with uh alternate revenue
 
01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
streams is something like bringing the
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
lottery system in to pay for education
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
and something like that but are you
 
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
thinking more like what different taxes
 
01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
can we do for
 
01:13:35.470 --> 01:13:35.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue so just to be clear right now
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
the lottery all of the lottery does go
 
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
into education um all of the you know
 
01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
money left over from after they give out
 
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
the winnings and pay for the staff and
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
the structure so that's a current
 
01:13:48.990 --> 01:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
existing Revenue Source yes the bill
 
01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
outlines looking at what other states do
 
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
for Revenue how how they they pay for
 
01:13:56.189 --> 01:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
public education as a data collection
 
01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
what do they do does it work does it not
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
work is it helpful is it Equitable or
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
not um so yes looking at other Revenue
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
sources and how they could either be if
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
there's new Revenue sources what that
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
impact would be so for example talking
 
01:14:13.629 --> 01:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
about sales and income taxes in New
 
01:14:16.149 --> 01:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is generally seen as you don't
 
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
go there right but a commission that
 
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
could say okay other states they have
 
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
income taxes they have sales taxes they
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
have different business taxes those are
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
just facts what would that look like in
 
01:14:29.709 --> 01:14:29.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire cuz then you all have that
 
01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
information then you all have that data
 
01:14:34.629 --> 01:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
would that help relieve local property
 
01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:35.960 align:start position:0%
taxes if it were directed towards
 
01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:37.960 align:start position:0%
special education funding specifically
 
01:14:40.189 --> 01:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
so that Winchester doesn't have to spend
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
you know rely so much on their local
 
01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
property taxes in these dramatic
 
01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
variations so as we I read the bill
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of the bill and I just
 
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to highlight the importance of
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
examining what other Revenue sources are
 
01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
but also what the impact on New
 
01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is so that as we're having
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
policy debates about what Revenue
 
01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
sources are best to use we have property
 
01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
tax right now we can compare that to
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
other other ways so that you have the
 
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
information there to say this would be
 
01:15:10.110 --> 01:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
helpful for these communities this would
 
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
be helpful for these communities and
 
01:15:13.629 --> 01:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
make informed decisions is that helpful
 
01:15:15.229 --> 01:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
it is thank you okay thank you for the
 
01:15:17.229 --> 01:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you very much no
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
further questions we will close the
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
01:15:22.199 --> 01:15:27.270 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
1176

01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:33.189 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
yes cards next one have any cards for
 
01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:37.750 align:start position:0%
yes cards next one have any cards for
next

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:52.199 --> 01:16:04.350 align:start position:0%
 
1639

01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
first we're going to begin the hearing
 
01:16:09.709 --> 01:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 1639 relative to children
 
01:16:11.669 --> 01:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
with disabilities placed at State
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
facilities for adjudicated youth I call
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
on representative cascaden the prime
 
01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this Bill thank you uh Madam
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
chair for the record Karine cascaden
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
representing uh Coos District 5 the city
 
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
of Berlin I'm here to present this bill
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the Department of Ed it has
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
to do with changing the terminology of
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
students students who are adjudicated
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
and placed in facilities so if you look
 
01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
at the Bell the same terminology is
 
01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
corrected throughout instead of using
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
the Youth Services Center um the
 
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation is to put is to call it
 
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
State facilities for adjudicated Youth
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
and County correctional facilities
 
01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
um and it is throughout um I am familiar
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
this is pretty much out of District to
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
give you my background I grew up
 
01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
bilingual and went to college and
 
01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
majored in foreign languages because it
 
01:17:09.149 --> 01:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
was easier um but then went into
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
teaching and started in secondary Ed at
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
the time there was lots of federal money
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
for bilingual education and they um
 
01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
provided me with tuition to be certified
 
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
as an elementary school classroom and
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
taught bilingual Ed in Middle School
 
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
um from there went into administration
 
01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
of elementary schools and was a very
 
01:17:32.629 --> 01:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
active part of the special ed process
 
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
from the referral to the disposition to
 
01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
evaluations um to the
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
placements uh outer District placements
 
01:17:47.550 --> 01:17:47.560 align:start position:0%
were rare but sometimes necessary I made
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
multiple trips visiting students at
 
01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
Prospect Academy at Spalding at Easter
 
01:17:57.310 --> 01:17:57.320 align:start position:0%
seals at ELC at Pine Haven um because
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
they were our
 
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
students so I have significantly
 
01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:04.360 align:start position:0%
participated in the special ed
 
01:18:08.629 --> 01:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
process um so I have um the department
 
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
of Ed E pet is here and attorney Fenton
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
to answer any specific questions um on
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
the change in terminology for this bill
 
01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
so it's that's pretty much it it doesn't
 
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
really change thank you very much
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden are there any
 
01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
questions for representa
 
01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
cascaden yes represent Damon thank you
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
question so I just want to clarify it
 
01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:36.199 align:start position:0%
seems to me that this is simply changing
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
the language because we don't have a
 
01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
Youth Services Center as such
 
01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
anymore or is it um suggesting other
 
01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:47.800 align:start position:0%
kinds of placements that are already
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
happening under different
 
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
terminology no it's based primarily I
 
01:18:54.669 --> 01:18:54.679 align:start position:0%
suspect and you can get more accurate
 
01:18:57.629 --> 01:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
information from um Becky is that the
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
Youth Services Center is not an existent
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
facility and as you know the state is
 
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
talking about what kind of facility to
 
01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
have but at least this terminology would
 
01:19:10.030 --> 01:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
cover anything for an adjudicated youth
 
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
whether in a state facility thank you
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
any further questions not see any thank
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
you very much you're welcome I'd like to
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
invite Rebecca fet Rebecca's here from
 
01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
the Department today she is not taking a
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
position she is here to provide support
 
01:19:25.199 --> 01:19:30.990 align:start position:0%
position she is here to provide support
to

01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:34.189 --> 01:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
us thank you representative lad um I am
 
01:19:35.669 --> 01:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
rebecc Fett I'm the state director of
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
special education at the Department of
 
01:19:39.310 --> 01:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
Education um we did ask for this bill
 
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
because if you look through the language
 
01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
just on this page there are some
 
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies between the Youth
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
Services Center um the youth the Youth
 
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
Development Center um and then with the
 
01:19:51.390 --> 01:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
possibility of the sonunu Youth Services
 
01:19:53.310 --> 01:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
Center changing we wanted to make the
 
01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
language more generic so that we
 
01:19:56.110 --> 01:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to keep coming back to you
 
01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
to change the name um that was purely
 
01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
the reason that we did this and tried to
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
make it so that it would cover anything
 
01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
um that might come up that would need to
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
be used this language I did just speak
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
with some of my colleagues at DHHS there
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
may be one piece that may have a
 
01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
conflict in it um on line 26 for
 
01:20:16.990 --> 01:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
students awaiting disposition so I might
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
be going back to representative cascaden
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
to just make an adjustment but that is
 
01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
why we put this forth was just to make
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
the language more generic and not have
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
to keep coming back to change what
 
01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
facility this might be and I'll take any
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
questions if you have them thank thank
 
01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.520 align:start position:0%

01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
it has a financial note we were asked
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
for a financial note um but it doesn't I
 
01:20:49.629 --> 01:20:49.639 align:start position:0%
don't have it with
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
me thank you it shouldn't have any
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.430 --> 01:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
but further further
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%

01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%

language together with representative
 
01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
cascaden right off here so possibly this
 
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:40.440 align:start position:0%

10:45 so we have a
 
01:21:54.669 --> 01:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:57.790 --> 01:21:57.800 align:start position:0%

01:21:59.629 --> 01:21:59.639 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
members as been has just recently been
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
put out by
 
01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
leadership the speaker all blurbs all

01:22:15.070 --> 01:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
the chair the day of the exec
 
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
session part of this as result of um we
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
initially had set aside Thursday
 
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
this week for and there was no no
 
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
committee reports being filed even
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
though bills had been
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
EXA and so the delay is is an issue so
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
be prepared to write your blurs your
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
committee reports and have them handed
 
01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
in before you leave the given dat that
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
the Bill's been EXA so that's going to
 
01:22:46.350 --> 01:22:46.360 align:start position:0%
take a lot of work and a lot of planning
 
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
and you're not going to note that next
 
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
we I have scheduled all kinds of bills
 
01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
um if you have any involvement with any
 
01:22:55.629 --> 01:22:55.639 align:start position:0%
of the bills you might get together
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
either with represent Miler or or myself
 
01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
and um discuss it but we will try to
 
01:23:06.189 --> 01:23:06.199 align:start position:0%
represent mil and I will try to look at
 
01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
this list and see which ones we are
 
01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
going to be taking up but it's not going
 
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
to stop us from taking anything that's
 
01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:14.440 align:start position:0%
on the agenda we need to make sure we
 
01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.790 align:start position:0%
on the agenda we need to make sure we
have

01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
the yeah yeah we that now we'll have
 
01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
extra hard copies for the reporting form
 
01:23:26.189 --> 01:23:26.199 align:start position:0%
available here or it can be done by way
 
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
technology um so that
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
well we're that's going to create a
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
burden on many here but it's going to
 
01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
expedite we have 107 bills which we got
 
01:23:41.310 --> 01:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
to exact so we're going to have to get
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
those reports in a timely manner
 
01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:45.719 align:start position:0%
especially these early bills which are
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
coming up and do out of this committee
 
01:23:52.189 --> 01:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
by the 15th of the next of February so
 
01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
that's that so we will get copies of the
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
form and make it available we'll keep
 
01:23:58.910 --> 01:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
them on the table back there um and put
 
01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
them for committee members only those
 
01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
would be the committee reports everybody
 
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
up in the meeting I was is just calling
 
01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
them blurbs because that's the
 
01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0%
historical way of calling these things
 
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
so if you hear me talk blur I'm talking
 
01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:11.550 align:start position:0%

leus yes I I have one other comment for
 
01:25:14.830 --> 01:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
you to know that we are going to have a
 
01:25:17.550 --> 01:25:17.560 align:start position:0%
situation sometimes where the the prime
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor or any sponsor is not here to
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
present the bill we often times identify
 
01:25:24.990 --> 01:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
somebody on the committee to go ahead
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
and present that bill if this person
 
01:25:29.189 --> 01:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
just presents that bill without getting
 
01:25:30.910 --> 01:25:30.920 align:start position:0%
into a discussion about the bill just
 
01:25:33.070 --> 01:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
presents the bill they may come back to
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
their chair and they may ask
 
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
questions uh but if you get that person
 
01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
for example it's going to happen this
 
01:25:42.109 --> 01:25:42.119 align:start position:0%
afternoon the prime sponsor of the bill
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
for the uh military connected students
 
01:25:49.149 --> 01:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
uh 1382 is not here I've been asked to
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
present it seeing I'm also military but
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to get any discussion on
 
01:25:56.109 --> 01:25:56.119 align:start position:0%
the bill and so if there's nobody else
 
01:25:59.109 --> 01:25:59.119 align:start position:0%
here to discuss it then we would just
 
01:26:00.910 --> 01:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
have an executive session later on on
 
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
the bill and if you have questions about
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
it you talk to the prime sponsor who
 
01:26:07.390 --> 01:26:07.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't there but the bill was introduced
 
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
so that's the way we're going to work
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:21.199 --> 01:46:46.030 align:start position:0%

01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
department shall adopt rules it's a
 
01:47:27.950 --> 01:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
state board of education so the
 
01:47:29.470 --> 01:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
department will do it on behalf of the
 
01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
State Board of
 
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
Education um it is to put back in law
 
01:47:37.310 --> 01:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
the IEP facilitation process which is um
 
01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:42.159 align:start position:0%
a process that can be um used prior to
 
01:47:46.270 --> 01:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
going to fullo process or more extensive
 
01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:47.390 align:start position:0%
going to fullo process or more extensive
um

01:47:47.390 --> 01:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:50.109 --> 01:47:50.119 align:start position:0%
resolutions the IEP facilitation process
 
01:47:52.270 --> 01:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
has has been in place and it has been in
 
01:47:56.589 --> 01:47:56.599 align:start position:0%
practice and in 2002 um that's when it
 
01:47:58.910 --> 01:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
first started and that's an independent
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
person that the school and the parent
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
agrees to have at a ni meeting they're
 
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
not there to make decisions they're
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
there to add guidance or uh and
 
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
facilitate the meeting so that there's
 
01:48:15.070 --> 01:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
Mutual um decision making in
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
2015 Senate Bell 166 was put on the
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
table to repeal the IEP facilitation
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
process and so the department would like
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
to put that back into statute um and the
 
01:48:32.430 --> 01:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
reason is that in a recent audit um
 
01:48:34.990 --> 01:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
their practice of doing I IEP
 
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
facilitation is is on their website it
 
01:48:39.950 --> 01:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
describes what you need to do how you
 
01:48:41.709 --> 01:48:41.719 align:start position:0%
need to do it the application or the
 
01:48:44.830 --> 01:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
paperwork is there but in the audit it
 
01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
was described that you couldn't exhibit
 
01:48:49.589 --> 01:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
you could not have this practice without
 
01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
legislation to support it so this this
 
01:48:56.830 --> 01:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
bill 1480 supports the IEP facilitation
 
01:48:58.910 --> 01:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
process that has been in place it's just
 
01:49:00.589 --> 01:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
connecting the
 
01:49:02.709 --> 01:49:02.719 align:start position:0%

department shall adopt rules and it
 
01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
should have been the State Board of
 
01:49:30.669 --> 01:49:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:33.510 --> 01:49:33.520 align:start position:0%

statute yes so it was previously in
 
01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:50.800 align:start position:0%

one Rebecca fet from the Department of
 
01:50:44.350 --> 01:50:44.360 align:start position:0%
Education special education good morning
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
um we asked for this um to be added back
 
01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
in as um representative cascaden said we
 
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
have been in an audit with the
 
01:50:53.709 --> 01:50:53.719 align:start position:0%
Legislative Office Building um and one
 
01:50:55.109 --> 01:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
of the things that came up was that this
 
01:50:57.990 --> 01:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
was not in legislation in 2015 it was
 
01:50:59.629 --> 01:50:59.639 align:start position:0%
repealed and it was thought that at the
 
01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
time that we could continue to do IEP
 
01:51:03.310 --> 01:51:03.320 align:start position:0%
facilitation without it being in
 
01:51:05.830 --> 01:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
legislation however um through the audit
 
01:51:08.189 --> 01:51:08.199 align:start position:0%
process we were told that we cannot so
 
01:51:09.990 --> 01:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
we've always had the process the process
 
01:51:12.189 --> 01:51:12.199 align:start position:0%
has never stopped it's been going since
 
01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:15.679 align:start position:0%
2002 um and we want to continue the
 
01:51:17.149 --> 01:51:17.159 align:start position:0%
process so we're asking to have it put
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
back into
 
01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:21.550 align:start position:0%
back into
legislation

01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:21.560 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:51:24.189 --> 01:51:24.199 align:start position:0%
so do you agree with the wording change
 
01:51:25.629 --> 01:51:25.639 align:start position:0%
yes I
 
01:51:28.709 --> 01:51:28.719 align:start position:0%
do representative McDonald thank you Mr
 
01:51:30.430 --> 01:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for your expertise
 
01:51:32.709 --> 01:51:32.719 align:start position:0%
in this area um my question is why was
 
01:51:35.470 --> 01:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
it repealed from law so from what I read
 
01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
in the um documents from the statement
 
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
the Senate bill it stated that um the
 
01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
person who presented that it should be
 
01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679 align:start position:0%
removed said that it could be done
 
01:51:46.149 --> 01:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
without um being in legislation and that
 
01:51:48.270 --> 01:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
it would make it a less adversarial
 
01:51:49.510 --> 01:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
process I believe was some of the
 
01:51:51.709 --> 01:51:51.719 align:start position:0%
wording that was used okay thank you I
 
01:51:54.870 --> 01:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't there represent cordelli uh thank
 
01:51:59.350 --> 01:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you for um being here um
 
01:52:02.990 --> 01:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
are there any differences in the people
 
01:52:07.149 --> 01:52:07.159 align:start position:0%
who can attend a facilitated
 
01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
IEP uh that are different than
 
01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
Ida um outline of who are participants
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
in an IEP I I talked to someone um who
 
01:52:22.189 --> 01:52:22.199 align:start position:0%
participated in in one not long ago and
 
01:52:24.629 --> 01:52:24.639 align:start position:0%
he said there was 14
 
01:52:24.639 --> 01:52:26.149 align:start position:0%
he said there was 14
people

01:52:26.149 --> 01:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:52:30.149 --> 01:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
um uh there from the uh Administration
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
if you will versus uh him and the um
 
01:52:35.669 --> 01:52:35.679 align:start position:0%
parent that he was with could you speak
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
to the participants in a facilitated IEP
 
01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
sure is so this should still be the same
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
participants that are required by Ida it
 
01:52:44.189 --> 01:52:44.199 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have any additional people
 
01:52:46.669 --> 01:52:46.679 align:start position:0%
beyond the IEP facilitator um this is
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
typically used when the district and the
 
01:52:50.669 --> 01:52:50.679 align:start position:0%
parents are can't come to an agreement
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
on something or they're having
 
01:52:53.470 --> 01:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
difficulty getting through the meeting
 
01:52:55.149 --> 01:52:55.159 align:start position:0%
and getting their their work
 
01:52:56.990 --> 01:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
accomplished so they ask for us to send
 
01:52:58.589 --> 01:52:58.599 align:start position:0%
this neutral party to come to the
 
01:53:00.229 --> 01:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
meeting to just literally run the
 
01:53:02.189 --> 01:53:02.199 align:start position:0%
meeting and make sure that we're they're
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
Crossing all their eyes dotting all
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
their tees doing what they're supposed
 
01:53:06.589 --> 01:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
to and um help them to come to
 
01:53:08.830 --> 01:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
resolution between the two of them they
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
there shouldn't be any extra or
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
additional people that are needed at the
 
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
meeting um they are becoming adversarial
 
01:53:16.510 --> 01:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
because this is kind of the beginning of
 
01:53:18.589 --> 01:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
the dispute resolution process so there
 
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
may be a few additional people because
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
it is becoming adversarial but there's
 
01:53:24.550 --> 01:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
no requirement for that there's no um
 
01:53:26.589 --> 01:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
nothing that says that that should be
 
01:53:30.750 --> 01:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
happening follow up um thank you
 
01:53:36.030 --> 01:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
um since um the audit um indicated that
 
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
this should be in legislation be it's in
 
01:53:41.189 --> 01:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
practice and it should therefore be in
 
01:53:43.229 --> 01:53:43.239 align:start position:0%
legislation um it seems to me that there
 
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
are great number of things that we have
 
01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
in practice that are not in um Federal
 
01:53:55.589 --> 01:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
Ida law or state law uh should not those
 
01:54:00.510 --> 01:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:03.790 --> 01:54:03.800 align:start position:0%
legislation yes I mean anything that is
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
in practice but not in legislation
 
01:54:08.990 --> 01:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:13.109 --> 01:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
yes further questions represent Miley
 
01:54:14.430 --> 01:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
being here I've got three questions
 
01:54:19.390 --> 01:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
sure since we're going to put this back
 
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
in into
 
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
law can you outline for us please I'm
 
01:54:26.709 --> 01:54:26.719 align:start position:0%
sure you thought about this what would
 
01:54:27.870 --> 01:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
be the
 
01:54:31.149 --> 01:54:31.159 align:start position:0%
rule what kinds of rules would the State
 
01:54:33.629 --> 01:54:33.639 align:start position:0%
Board be adopting as far as what the
 
01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
language be and what the uh the the
 
01:54:40.069 --> 01:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
volume and area that this would cover
 
01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
sure so um as we've discussed with the
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
Auditors through this dispute resolution
 
01:54:45.790 --> 01:54:45.800 align:start position:0%
audit um we would go into rule to
 
01:54:47.470 --> 01:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
explain how the process should look when
 
01:54:49.390 --> 01:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
it is we really already have procedures
 
01:54:51.149 --> 01:54:51.159 align:start position:0%
in place place but they have asked us to
 
01:54:54.589 --> 01:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
look at rules to um set parameters on
 
01:54:57.629 --> 01:54:57.639 align:start position:0%
how this should run how many people
 
01:54:59.109 --> 01:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
discussing I'm sorry there's a lot of
 
01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
things they've told me so it's all
 
01:55:02.669 --> 01:55:02.679 align:start position:0%
running through my brain right now um
 
01:55:04.350 --> 01:55:04.360 align:start position:0%
making sure that if there's a conflict
 
01:55:06.510 --> 01:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
of interest we have um information
 
01:55:08.910 --> 01:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
regarding how to notify a of a conflict
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
of interest how the process runs um who
 
01:55:16.270 --> 01:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
how many people how many um cases can be
 
01:55:18.750 --> 01:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
heard by an IP facilitator in a year all
 
01:55:20.589 --> 01:55:20.599 align:start position:0%
of those parameters around the just the
 
01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
running of the program thank you second
 
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
question please second question is uh
 
01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
who are these
 
01:55:32.030 --> 01:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
facilitators and what as a training have
 
01:55:34.870 --> 01:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
they had to be the facilitator sure so
 
01:55:36.350 --> 01:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
um for many years we had just one
 
01:55:38.109 --> 01:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
facilitator who was an experienced
 
01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
special educator who had been in the
 
01:55:41.950 --> 01:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
field for years and had retired however
 
01:55:43.790 --> 01:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
we do also um provide them with
 
01:55:46.109 --> 01:55:46.119 align:start position:0%
trainings nationally for IEP
 
01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:48.040 align:start position:0%
facilitation so anytime there is
 
01:55:50.350 --> 01:55:50.360 align:start position:0%
somebody from our TA Center or one of
 
01:55:52.109 --> 01:55:52.119 align:start position:0%
the national organizations for dispute
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
resolution that puts out a facilitation
 
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
training we will pay for them to attend
 
01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
that training um we now have two
 
01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
facilitators and both of them have
 
01:56:03.430 --> 01:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
either attended or are attending the IEP
 
01:56:05.189 --> 01:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
facilitation trainings through these
 
01:56:07.109 --> 01:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
technical assistance centers and many
 
01:56:08.910 --> 01:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
and these technical assistance centers
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
are funded by the federal government
 
01:56:13.149 --> 01:56:13.159 align:start position:0%
through oap to provide these services to
 
01:56:16.830 --> 01:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
us thank you follow third follow one one
 
01:56:19.589 --> 01:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
question yes pardon me yes go ahead
 
01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
third question is can you define for us
 
01:56:24.790 --> 01:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
what is the process I mean once you get
 
01:56:28.870 --> 01:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
into this uh the the con the the
 
01:56:31.950 --> 01:56:31.960 align:start position:0%
conversation around IAP placement and
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
services Etc what is the process that
 
01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
first level we agree okay what so what's
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
the next level how what's the process
 
01:56:43.709 --> 01:56:43.719 align:start position:0%
that a parent would go through to
 
01:56:45.910 --> 01:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
finally get final resolution to what
 
01:56:48.109 --> 01:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
their concerns are for their child so
 
01:56:50.109 --> 01:56:50.119 align:start position:0%
the parents can um
 
01:56:52.069 --> 01:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
before even getting to IEP facilitation
 
01:56:54.310 --> 01:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
on the IEP they can say I agree in part
 
01:56:55.990 --> 01:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
to the IEP and they can ask for the
 
01:56:58.350 --> 01:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
district to address a an area that they
 
01:57:02.550 --> 01:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
don't agree with um they can go to I the
 
01:57:03.990 --> 01:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
parents can request this IEP
 
01:57:06.149 --> 01:57:06.159 align:start position:0%
facilitation themselves they can go to
 
01:57:10.109 --> 01:57:10.119 align:start position:0%
do process they can go to um complaints
 
01:57:12.510 --> 01:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
so depending on what their issue is like
 
01:57:14.229 --> 01:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
we encourage the districts to work with
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
them and if the parent doesn't agree for
 
01:57:17.310 --> 01:57:17.320 align:start position:0%
something they should be having another
 
01:57:18.990 --> 01:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
meeting to discuss the part that the
 
01:57:20.790 --> 01:57:20.800 align:start position:0%
parent doesn't agree to there may just
 
01:57:22.430 --> 01:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
be one piece to it I'd think that my
 
01:57:25.109 --> 01:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
child needs three services for speech
 
01:57:26.709 --> 01:57:26.719 align:start position:0%
instead of two and so I'll agree to
 
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
everything else to get the IEP in place
 
01:57:30.030 --> 01:57:30.040 align:start position:0%
but then the district and the parents
 
01:57:31.470 --> 01:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
should be meeting to discuss how they
 
01:57:33.390 --> 01:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
can come to an agreement on that next
 
01:57:36.430 --> 01:57:36.440 align:start position:0%
piece and if I don't agree what what's
 
01:57:38.229 --> 01:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
my resolution so then if you don't agree
 
01:57:40.229 --> 01:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
you can go to IEP facilitation you can
 
01:57:42.390 --> 01:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
say the parent can request an IEP
 
01:57:44.270 --> 01:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
facilitator or the district can request
 
01:57:45.870 --> 01:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
the only caveat to either of those is
 
01:57:47.589 --> 01:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
that both parties need to agree to it so
 
01:57:49.390 --> 01:57:49.400 align:start position:0%
if the parent requests in the district
 
01:57:50.629 --> 01:57:50.639 align:start position:0%
says no we wouldn't do it but if the
 
01:57:52.149 --> 01:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
district requested and the parents said
 
01:57:54.350 --> 01:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
no we wouldn't do it either um we also
 
01:57:56.270 --> 01:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
will not do an IEP facilitation if
 
01:57:57.669 --> 01:57:57.679 align:start position:0%
you're already in another dispute
 
01:57:59.149 --> 01:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
resolution process so if you've already
 
01:58:01.229 --> 01:58:01.239 align:start position:0%
gone to the complaints process or you've
 
01:58:03.709 --> 01:58:03.719 align:start position:0%
gone to um mediation or due or due
 
01:58:05.470 --> 01:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
process we don't want to go backwards
 
01:58:07.390 --> 01:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
and put you into IEP facilitation we
 
01:58:09.790 --> 01:58:09.800 align:start position:0%
need to let you do that through the the
 
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
regular process but you can ask for an
 
01:58:13.709 --> 01:58:13.719 align:start position:0%
IEP facilitator and depending on what
 
01:58:15.189 --> 01:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
your concern is you could go you could
 
01:58:18.030 --> 01:58:18.040 align:start position:0%
take it even further to complaints thank
 
01:58:22.910 --> 01:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
you uh represent Damon then thank you Mr
 
01:58:25.709 --> 01:58:25.719 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my
 
01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
question I have no expertise in this so
 
01:58:32.950 --> 01:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the current bill and a
 
01:58:36.270 --> 01:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
bill we're hearing some time today 1443
 
01:58:38.750 --> 01:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
about special ed dispute resolution that
 
01:58:41.149 --> 01:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
talks about the process of neutral
 
01:58:43.629 --> 01:58:43.639 align:start position:0%
conferences can you help me understand
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
the difference between the facilitation
 
01:58:48.270 --> 01:58:48.280 align:start position:0%
in the neutral conference and what
 
01:58:50.030 --> 01:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
overlap there might be between these two
 
01:58:51.629 --> 01:58:51.639 align:start position:0%
bills that are in the same part of the
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
statute so I can explain to you the IEP
 
01:58:56.030 --> 01:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
facilitation piece I would defer to my
 
01:58:57.950 --> 01:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
colleague Diana Fenton or Steven Berwick
 
01:59:00.510 --> 01:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
to clearly explain to you um neutral
 
01:59:02.310 --> 01:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
conference just because I know the
 
01:59:04.709 --> 01:59:04.719 align:start position:0%
generic piece of it but IEP facilitation
 
01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
is in my office whereas dispute any of
 
01:59:09.069 --> 01:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
the other dispute resolution processes
 
01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
are in the office of governance um so
 
01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
Diana oversees all of those IEP
 
01:59:15.229 --> 01:59:15.239 align:start position:0%
facilitation is almost like the
 
01:59:16.830 --> 01:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
precursor to all the other dispute
 
01:59:18.669 --> 01:59:18.679 align:start position:0%
resolution processes it's like we're
 
01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
having a agreement we can't get through
 
01:59:21.950 --> 01:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
the meeting let's have somebody come in
 
01:59:23.870 --> 01:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
and help us before we go to those other
 
01:59:26.350 --> 01:59:26.360 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution processes so that's
 
01:59:28.390 --> 01:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
and we run that through my office um
 
01:59:30.430 --> 01:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
with one of our education consultants
 
01:59:32.870 --> 01:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
and we assign the IEP facilitator
 
01:59:35.149 --> 01:59:35.159 align:start position:0%
anything else Beyond this um IEP
 
01:59:36.709 --> 01:59:36.719 align:start position:0%
facilitation goes into the office of
 
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
governance where it would be the state
 
01:59:40.069 --> 01:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
complaint or the neutral conference or
 
01:59:44.910 --> 01:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
mediation or due process follow yes so
 
01:59:47.510 --> 01:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
just to clarify the facilitators that
 
01:59:49.830 --> 01:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
you described in response to
 
01:59:52.390 --> 01:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
representative Myer's question are not
 
01:59:56.069 --> 01:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
the same people as the neutrals no thank
 
01:59:59.189 --> 01:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
you representative Ford oh excuse me
 
02:00:00.589 --> 02:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner had her hand up
 
02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
first here thank you uh are there a list
 
02:00:05.669 --> 02:00:05.679 align:start position:0%
of facilitators that how to how do
 
02:00:07.790 --> 02:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
parents find a facilitator so on our
 
02:00:10.030 --> 02:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
website um we assigned the facilitator
 
02:00:11.669 --> 02:00:11.679 align:start position:0%
we only have two right now and so they
 
02:00:14.069 --> 02:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
would go to the website um and there's a
 
02:00:16.390 --> 02:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
link that you contact our education
 
02:00:19.310 --> 02:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
consultant for the application and to um
 
02:00:22.189 --> 02:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
apply for an IEP facilitator and it
 
02:00:24.629 --> 02:00:24.639 align:start position:0%
depends on their availability and um and
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
I said as I said conflict of interest or
 
02:00:28.189 --> 02:00:28.199 align:start position:0%
anything like that so we do assign them
 
02:00:29.390 --> 02:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
it's not something you would reach out
 
02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
to them directly it goes through our
 
02:00:35.550 --> 02:00:35.560 align:start position:0%
office represent
 
02:00:37.950 --> 02:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:00:41.109 --> 02:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
for taking my question is this process
 
02:00:43.390 --> 02:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
made known to the parents from the
 
02:00:46.109 --> 02:00:46.119 align:start position:0%
beginning so they understand they move
 
02:00:48.589 --> 02:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
this step to that step to the next step
 
02:00:50.350 --> 02:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
it just seems seems to me that an awful
 
02:00:53.790 --> 02:00:53.800 align:start position:0%
lot of anxiety about this and and you
 
02:00:55.669 --> 02:00:55.679 align:start position:0%
can understand why with the parents and
 
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
the students but I I'm just wondering
 
02:01:01.589 --> 02:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
how do we facilitate their understanding
 
02:01:04.270 --> 02:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
of it all y so we um share information
 
02:01:05.830 --> 02:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
with the parent information center so
 
02:01:07.350 --> 02:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
that we ensure that parents have know
 
02:01:09.550 --> 02:01:09.560 align:start position:0%
about IEP facilitation we also have it
 
02:01:13.069 --> 02:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
on our website and um we talk about it
 
02:01:15.229 --> 02:01:15.239 align:start position:0%
anytime a parent calls and says I'm
 
02:01:17.109 --> 02:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
having an issue or I have you know can
 
02:01:19.149 --> 02:01:19.159 align:start position:0%
you help me with this we will suggest
 
02:01:20.990 --> 02:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
whatever dispute resolution process we
 
02:01:22.709 --> 02:01:22.719 align:start position:0%
think might help them um and we
 
02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
recommend this on a regular basis would
 
02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
you like to consider an IEP facilitator
 
02:01:27.510 --> 02:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you're still in the
 
02:01:29.390 --> 02:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
process where that might help you where
 
02:01:32.229 --> 02:01:32.239 align:start position:0%
you are in this process does that seem
 
02:01:33.750 --> 02:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
in do you have followup question
 
02:01:36.750 --> 02:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
followup I'm sorry uh does that seem in
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
your experience to reduce somewhat the
 
02:01:42.229 --> 02:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
confrontational aspect of it from what
 
02:01:43.470 --> 02:01:43.480 align:start position:0%
we've heard from school districts and
 
02:01:45.189 --> 02:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
parents yes it does um we actually have
 
02:01:46.750 --> 02:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
had an increase in the last two years we
 
02:01:50.109 --> 02:01:50.119 align:start position:0%
had had probably 23 from 20 2 to about
 
02:01:52.950 --> 02:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
2023 and then in the last since July 1
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
of 2023 we've had 17 IEP facilitations
 
02:01:58.910 --> 02:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
so it is in increase it is increasing
 
02:02:00.750 --> 02:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
and from what we hear it is extremely
 
02:02:02.310 --> 02:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
helpful on both sides from what we've
 
02:02:04.109 --> 02:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
heard from the participants thank you
 
02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:05.920 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
02:02:20.510 --> 02:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
question um there was a letter that came
 
02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
from the sac committee that uh said that
 
02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
they supported the bill but it says um
 
02:02:26.750 --> 02:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
we respectfully request that it be
 
02:02:29.790 --> 02:02:29.800 align:start position:0%
amended to State either party school or
 
02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
parent maybe Crest an i AP facilitation
 
02:02:35.390 --> 02:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
is that already I believe if you look I
 
02:02:37.270 --> 02:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
don't have the um Statute in front of me
 
02:02:39.189 --> 02:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
but if I believe if you look farther up
 
02:02:43.229 --> 02:02:43.239 align:start position:0%
in RSA um c23 there it does say that
 
02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's available to parents or
 
02:02:50.470 --> 02:02:50.480 align:start position:0%

students with disabilities uh they are
 
02:29:42.870 --> 02:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill I just want you
 
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
guys to have those statements in
 
02:29:45.520 --> 02:29:47.550 align:start position:0%
guys to have those statements in
hand

02:29:47.550 --> 02:29:47.560 align:start position:0%
hand
 
02:29:49.389 --> 02:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
uh I am representative Ron dun from
 
02:29:51.790 --> 02:29:51.800 align:start position:0%
Londoner and I'm here today sponsoring a
 
02:29:53.429 --> 02:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
bill that would allow special education
 
02:29:55.510 --> 02:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
observation in the classro and allow
 
02:29:57.830 --> 02:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
input from parents with
 
02:29:59.910 --> 02:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
IEPs this issue was brought to my
 
02:30:02.510 --> 02:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
attention by my constituent Jamie Carter
 
02:30:03.830 --> 02:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
there is a letter you have in your hand
 
02:30:05.910 --> 02:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
today after doing some research and
 
02:30:08.070 --> 02:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
giving this issue some thought I saw the
 
02:30:09.230 --> 02:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
importance of being here today and
 
02:30:11.550 --> 02:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
presenting this issue to this
 
02:30:14.309 --> 02:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
committee a parent of special needs
 
02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
knows how challenging it is and
 
02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
rewarding it can be for their child to
 
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
be involved in their
 
02:30:22.230 --> 02:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
education there are many reasons why
 
02:30:23.870 --> 02:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
this practice can have positive results
 
02:30:26.389 --> 02:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
for both parents and children let me
 
02:30:28.190 --> 02:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
share some with you today thank you
 
02:30:30.510 --> 02:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
first they can help parents understand
 
02:30:32.349 --> 02:30:32.359 align:start position:0%
their children's strengths challenges
 
02:30:34.750 --> 02:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
and needs better by seeing how their
 
02:30:36.190 --> 02:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
child interacts with the teacher and
 
02:30:38.710 --> 02:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
other students parents can gain insight
 
02:30:40.150 --> 02:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
into their child's learning style
 
02:30:43.030 --> 02:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
preferences and goals this can help them
 
02:30:44.910 --> 02:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
tailor their home environment activities
 
02:30:48.150 --> 02:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
support and develop and learning it can
 
02:30:49.429 --> 02:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
also help them communicate more
 
02:30:50.790 --> 02:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
effectively with their
 
02:30:53.910 --> 02:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
child second it can foster a positive
 
02:30:56.150 --> 02:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
partnership between parents and teachers
 
02:30:57.750 --> 02:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
by sharing information and feedback
 
02:30:59.590 --> 02:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
parents and teachers can work together
 
02:31:02.630 --> 02:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
to create individualized education
 
02:31:04.870 --> 02:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
plans parents can also feel more
 
02:31:05.990 --> 02:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
involved and supported in the
 
02:31:08.230 --> 02:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
decision-making process this can lead to
 
02:31:11.349 --> 02:31:11.359 align:start position:0%
a higher level of trust respect and
 
02:31:13.190 --> 02:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
cooperation between parents and teachers
 
02:31:14.349 --> 02:31:14.359 align:start position:0%
and this would benefit the child's
 
02:31:21.150 --> 02:31:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:23.070 --> 02:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
third by allowing parents to observe
 
02:31:25.269 --> 02:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
classroom activities teachers can expose
 
02:31:27.469 --> 02:31:27.479 align:start position:0%
children to special needs with different
 
02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
perspectives cultures and experiences
 
02:31:32.150 --> 02:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
this can help them develop social skills
 
02:31:34.990 --> 02:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
empathy tolerance can also help them
 
02:31:36.990 --> 02:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
feel more accepted
 
02:31:39.110 --> 02:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
valued uh it can also boost their
 
02:31:41.070 --> 02:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
self-confidence which can enhance their
 
02:31:42.550 --> 02:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
learning and their
 
02:31:44.469 --> 02:31:44.479 align:start position:0%
participation it can also enhance
 
02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
academic outcomes for children with
 
02:31:48.349 --> 02:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
special needs by observing classroom
 
02:31:50.190 --> 02:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
instruction parents can learn about
 
02:31:52.309 --> 02:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
effective strategies accommodations that
 
02:31:54.830 --> 02:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
can help their child succeed in school
 
02:31:56.230 --> 02:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
they also can provide encouragement
 
02:31:58.910 --> 02:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
motivation for their child at home and
 
02:32:00.550 --> 02:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
in the learning environment at
 
02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
school as you can see by allowing
 
02:32:04.269 --> 02:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
parents to observe in the classroom for
 
02:32:06.309 --> 02:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
special need students can have many
 
02:32:08.990 --> 02:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
positive effects for both the parents
 
02:32:11.590 --> 02:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
the teachers and the child it can help
 
02:32:13.510 --> 02:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
parents understand their child better
 
02:32:16.550 --> 02:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
foster more positive partnership with
 
02:32:18.910 --> 02:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
teachers and enhance academic outcomes
 
02:32:21.309 --> 02:32:21.319 align:start position:0%
for the children I hope you agree with
 
02:32:22.830 --> 02:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
me that this practice should be
 
02:32:24.790 --> 02:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
encouraged and supported by schools and
 
02:32:27.030 --> 02:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
policy makers thank you for your time
 
02:32:28.389 --> 02:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
today if anyone has any questions I'd be
 
02:32:29.790 --> 02:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them thank you very much
 
02:32:31.230 --> 02:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
for your testimony are there questions
 
02:32:33.070 --> 02:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
from the committee represent
 
02:32:35.389 --> 02:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:32:38.389 --> 02:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
for being here today uh we did receive
 
02:32:41.870 --> 02:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
one of your handouts was from the
 
02:32:45.349 --> 02:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
um the from from the committee and they
 
02:32:47.150 --> 02:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
noted here
 
02:32:49.830 --> 02:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
that they wanted it to be amended the
 
02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
bill to be amended to remove the
 
02:32:55.070 --> 02:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
statement School District shall impose
 
02:32:57.870 --> 02:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
no conditions or restrictions what's
 
02:33:00.950 --> 02:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
your uh response to that request I'm
 
02:33:02.030 --> 02:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely fine with that whatever this
 
02:33:03.910 --> 02:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
committee decides I'm fine with that
 
02:33:05.710 --> 02:33:05.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions from
 
02:33:08.870 --> 02:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
the committee represent Belcher thank
 
02:33:10.830 --> 02:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and following up on on that
 
02:33:13.630 --> 02:33:13.640 align:start position:0%
exact point on that last one uh removing
 
02:33:15.990 --> 02:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh the line on shall not impose
 
02:33:17.750 --> 02:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
condition or restrictions obviously the
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
point of this bill is to be as open as
 
02:33:22.790 --> 02:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
as possible I too see a problem with
 
02:33:24.830 --> 02:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
obviously the possibility of imposing no
 
02:33:26.830 --> 02:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
conditions because it could go
 
02:33:29.030 --> 02:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
weird do you think there might be Middle
 
02:33:31.349 --> 02:33:31.359 align:start position:0%
Ground such as school district shall
 
02:33:33.349 --> 02:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
impose no unreasonable conditions or
 
02:33:35.750 --> 02:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
restrictions something like that thank
 
02:33:38.910 --> 02:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
you for the question absolutely thank
 
02:33:42.870 --> 02:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
you foron
 
02:33:45.309 --> 02:33:45.319 align:start position:0%
Damon I'm not sure if you're the person
 
02:33:47.349 --> 02:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
to answer this question are one of the
 
02:33:49.429 --> 02:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
technical experts
 
02:33:53.590 --> 02:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
but what are the situations now for
 
02:33:56.550 --> 02:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
parents who want to observe I mean I
 
02:33:58.790 --> 02:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
know parents who have observed in
 
02:34:01.550 --> 02:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
schools I've been
 
02:34:04.349 --> 02:34:04.359 align:start position:0%
one I can ask you to refer to Jamie
 
02:34:06.790 --> 02:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
Carter's letter and then I'll also defer
 
02:34:08.990 --> 02:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
the question to the next person to
 
02:34:10.670 --> 02:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
testify she would have much better
 
02:34:13.269 --> 02:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
firsthand knowledge of that than I
 
02:34:16.190 --> 02:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
would further questions yes Pres
 
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
cardelli thank you thank you
 
02:34:20.070 --> 02:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative dun uh for bringing this
 
02:34:25.550 --> 02:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
forward um having um uh observation
 
02:34:29.150 --> 02:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
access by uh evaluators or
 
02:34:32.230 --> 02:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
Consultants um would you see them coming
 
02:34:35.550 --> 02:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
in with the parent or would you see them
 
02:34:38.349 --> 02:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
um coming in independently or uh does it
 
02:34:39.230 --> 02:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
make a
 
02:34:41.469 --> 02:34:41.479 align:start position:0%
difference thank you for the question I
 
02:34:44.550 --> 02:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
would say either option would
 
02:34:47.630 --> 02:34:47.640 align:start position:0%
work further question
 
02:34:50.990 --> 02:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
02:34:54.030 --> 02:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call Mariah
 
02:35:01.389 --> 02:35:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:05.950 --> 02:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
Ryan committee thank you um I'm here to
 
02:35:09.510 --> 02:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
support hb1 1524 um I want to point out
 
02:35:11.510 --> 02:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
in section 300.
 
02:35:14.230 --> 02:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
310 um of federal code it says that all
 
02:35:16.230 --> 02:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
public agencies must ensure that a child
 
02:35:17.990 --> 02:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
is able to be observed in the child's
 
02:35:20.429 --> 02:35:20.439 align:start position:0%
learning environment um and that this
 
02:35:24.150 --> 02:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
would support that um to your point uh
 
02:35:27.950 --> 02:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
the courts have said that um essentially
 
02:35:29.349 --> 02:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
school districts cannot impose
 
02:35:32.110 --> 02:35:32.120 align:start position:0%
unreasonable conditions um but they can
 
02:35:34.429 --> 02:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
request the confidentiality agreement so
 
02:35:36.389 --> 02:35:36.399 align:start position:0%
the court felt that confidentiality
 
02:35:37.950 --> 02:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
agreements to not discuss other students
 
02:35:39.550 --> 02:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
would be okay but a parent can obviously
 
02:35:42.030 --> 02:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
give permission to um talk about their
 
02:35:45.230 --> 02:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
own kid um as for my own experience with
 
02:35:46.590 --> 02:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
uh trying to get get classroom
 
02:35:48.990 --> 02:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
observations from my son who has autism
 
02:35:50.510 --> 02:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
I had to fight with the school for 2
 
02:35:52.990 --> 02:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
years when I finally was able to get an
 
02:35:55.190 --> 02:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
observation in place I was glad I did
 
02:35:56.870 --> 02:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
get the observation because I found that
 
02:35:58.590 --> 02:35:58.600 align:start position:0%
the the school district had put my son
 
02:36:01.030 --> 02:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
in the corner with two special education
 
02:36:02.630 --> 02:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
teachers around him and I said we can't
 
02:36:04.030 --> 02:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
do that because he can't concentrate on
 
02:36:06.190 --> 02:36:06.200 align:start position:0%
a lesson and have two people next to him
 
02:36:07.550 --> 02:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
talking to him
 
02:36:09.389 --> 02:36:09.399 align:start position:0%
simultaneously um there are plenty of
 
02:36:10.469 --> 02:36:10.479 align:start position:0%
other parents who have gone into
 
02:36:12.110 --> 02:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
classrooms or had Specialists go into
 
02:36:14.429 --> 02:36:14.439 align:start position:0%
classrooms to get data to evaluate
 
02:36:16.870 --> 02:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not an IEP is working
 
02:36:18.950 --> 02:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
um to determine whether or not fape is
 
02:36:21.389 --> 02:36:21.399 align:start position:0%
being provided if a parent is denied an
 
02:36:23.309 --> 02:36:23.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to observe in the classroom
 
02:36:25.070 --> 02:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
the court has unilaterally said that as
 
02:36:28.750 --> 02:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
a denial of fatee automatically so um
 
02:36:31.230 --> 02:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
this came about via various coure cases
 
02:36:33.469 --> 02:36:33.479 align:start position:0%
Schaefer versus whis is one of them but
 
02:36:35.550 --> 02:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
as Jamie had stated in her testimony to
 
02:36:37.630 --> 02:36:37.640 align:start position:0%
you the state of Massachusetts actually
 
02:36:40.790 --> 02:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
put this in as a law because it has to
 
02:36:42.630 --> 02:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
be parents have to be able to get data
 
02:36:43.990 --> 02:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
on whether or not their kids' education
 
02:36:46.469 --> 02:36:46.479 align:start position:0%
is working so
 
02:36:49.110 --> 02:36:49.120 align:start position:0%
it is an imperative component of this
 
02:36:50.790 --> 02:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
and I think if a school district wants
 
02:36:52.790 --> 02:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
to have some sort of restrictions if
 
02:36:54.150 --> 02:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
they work with the parent I think the
 
02:36:55.870 --> 02:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
parent would be amenable because all the
 
02:36:58.230 --> 02:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
parent really wants is to have their kid
 
02:37:00.790 --> 02:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
get the the appropriate education or the
 
02:37:02.429 --> 02:37:02.439 align:start position:0%
you know the best situation possible for
 
02:37:05.590 --> 02:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
them um with that in mind um I'm kind of
 
02:37:07.190 --> 02:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
pressed for time so I'd like to just
 
02:37:08.710 --> 02:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
start taking questions if that's
 
02:37:11.670 --> 02:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
possible that's fine I have one for you
 
02:37:14.630 --> 02:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh you you mentioned confidentiality and
 
02:37:16.630 --> 02:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
unreasonable uh
 
02:37:19.750 --> 02:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
as a adjective for talking about uh
 
02:37:22.750 --> 02:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
imposing conditions Etc or restrictions
 
02:37:24.710 --> 02:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
yes sir uh can you give me some examples
 
02:37:26.070 --> 02:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
of what would be
 
02:37:29.110 --> 02:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
unreasonable um you can't observe unless
 
02:37:30.750 --> 02:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
a special education director is there
 
02:37:32.830 --> 02:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
we'll only give you 20 minutes of time
 
02:37:34.389 --> 02:37:34.399 align:start position:0%
you can't have a professional come in
 
02:37:37.230 --> 02:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
and observe um will'll only allow you to
 
02:37:39.870 --> 02:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
observe during gym class uh those would
 
02:37:41.469 --> 02:37:41.479 align:start position:0%
be examples of unreasonable and those
 
02:37:43.110 --> 02:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
were specifically stated by the court
 
02:37:45.429 --> 02:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
sir thank you further questions from the
 
02:37:45.439 --> 02:37:48.030 align:start position:0%
sir thank you further questions from the
committee

02:37:48.030 --> 02:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:50.309 --> 02:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
yes represent Celli thank you thank you
 
02:37:54.389 --> 02:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
for your testimony um when you um say
 
02:37:57.110 --> 02:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
they were indicated by the courts are
 
02:37:59.309 --> 02:37:59.319 align:start position:0%
you referring to schaer versus whis in
 
02:38:02.870 --> 02:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
that regard or other cases schaer versus
 
02:38:04.950 --> 02:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
whis is one of the cases and but that
 
02:38:06.750 --> 02:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
case in particular was a Massachusetts
 
02:38:09.150 --> 02:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
case in the federal doe due process and
 
02:38:12.469 --> 02:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:14.710 --> 02:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
committee further
 
02:38:17.510 --> 02:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
02:38:37.790 --> 02:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:41.190 align:start position:0%
 
berson

02:38:41.190 --> 02:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:43.309 --> 02:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
welcome good morning my name is Jane
 
02:38:45.389 --> 02:38:45.399 align:start position:0%
berson bullu I'm the executive director
 
02:38:47.830 --> 02:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
of the special ed administrators I'm
 
02:38:51.030 --> 02:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
here representing over 270 members of
 
02:38:53.790 --> 02:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
our association um who work in both
 
02:38:55.469 --> 02:38:55.479 align:start position:0%
public schools and our private special
 
02:38:58.469 --> 02:38:58.479 align:start position:0%
education schools I'm here representing
 
02:39:00.150 --> 02:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
the association we're not taking a
 
02:39:03.030 --> 02:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
stance on the bill but um our members
 
02:39:05.750 --> 02:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
did um ask that I bring forward some
 
02:39:08.590 --> 02:39:08.600 align:start position:0%
comments uh for your
 
02:39:12.070 --> 02:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
consideration upon a review of the bill
 
02:39:15.030 --> 02:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
um our Association members really felt
 
02:39:18.590 --> 02:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
as though um locally um every district
 
02:39:22.150 --> 02:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
has policy related to visitors uh to
 
02:39:25.070 --> 02:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
schools and observations in classrooms
 
02:39:27.710 --> 02:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
um and as our members reviewed this bill
 
02:39:30.950 --> 02:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
they felt as though um bringing forward
 
02:39:33.630 --> 02:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
uh more legislation um really wasn't
 
02:39:36.710 --> 02:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
necessary at this point and that school
 
02:39:40.070 --> 02:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
districts pretty much um had policy even
 
02:39:41.550 --> 02:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
we checked in with our private special
 
02:39:44.510 --> 02:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
education schools and they also have uh
 
02:39:47.429 --> 02:39:47.439 align:start position:0%
developed policies on this topic uh
 
02:39:49.990 --> 02:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
relative to visitors and observations in
 
02:39:52.110 --> 02:39:52.120 align:start position:0%
classrooms and that includes everything
 
02:39:54.070 --> 02:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
from safety to security to
 
02:39:56.510 --> 02:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and and those kinds of
 
02:39:58.950 --> 02:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
things so we really felt as though um
 
02:40:01.230 --> 02:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
more legislation probably was not
 
02:40:03.190 --> 02:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
necessary and that it should be left to
 
02:40:04.710 --> 02:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
the local
 
02:40:08.750 --> 02:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
level um additionally um in terms of the
 
02:40:10.790 --> 02:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
the language in this bill it calls for
 
02:40:12.910 --> 02:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
allowing independent
 
02:40:16.150 --> 02:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
evaluators uh to observe in classrooms
 
02:40:18.990 --> 02:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
um that currently happens um it's very
 
02:40:21.630 --> 02:40:21.640 align:start position:0%
common for school districts and parents
 
02:40:25.349 --> 02:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
to uh be getting independent evaluators
 
02:40:28.710 --> 02:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
um to come in observe kids conduct
 
02:40:30.830 --> 02:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
evaluations um and there are protocols
 
02:40:33.070 --> 02:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
and processes that are already in place
 
02:40:35.710 --> 02:40:35.720 align:start position:0%
and it it seems to be a a pretty uh
 
02:40:38.950 --> 02:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
common practice in in talking with our
 
02:40:41.790 --> 02:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
members um the other comments that that
 
02:40:44.269 --> 02:40:44.279 align:start position:0%
our members brought forward was that the
 
02:40:47.269 --> 02:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
language in the bill really um moves
 
02:40:51.309 --> 02:40:51.319 align:start position:0%
more towards giving very uh unrestricted
 
02:40:54.110 --> 02:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
unlimited um amounts of times in
 
02:40:55.990 --> 02:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
programs and we all know whether it be a
 
02:40:58.710 --> 02:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
special education program or General Ed
 
02:41:03.630 --> 02:41:03.640 align:start position:0%
program um having um unlimited time for
 
02:41:07.030 --> 02:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
visitors can be very dis you know um
 
02:41:09.469 --> 02:41:09.479 align:start position:0%
distracting disruptive um and they're
 
02:41:12.349 --> 02:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
really needs to be um some guard rails
 
02:41:14.349 --> 02:41:14.359 align:start position:0%
around that and and this bill really
 
02:41:16.790 --> 02:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
seemed to be pretty br
 
02:41:18.910 --> 02:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
um those were the the comments uh that
 
02:41:20.710 --> 02:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
our members brought forward and wanted
 
02:41:23.550 --> 02:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
me to bring to your attention um and we
 
02:41:25.429 --> 02:41:25.439 align:start position:0%
would ask that maybe you consider those
 
02:41:28.590 --> 02:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
before uh moving the bill forward in uh
 
02:41:31.429 --> 02:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
the process so thank you for your time
 
02:41:32.950 --> 02:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I do have a question
 
02:41:35.269 --> 02:41:35.279 align:start position:0%
for you I'll start out you talked about
 
02:41:37.469 --> 02:41:37.479 align:start position:0%
independent uh
 
02:41:40.630 --> 02:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
evaluators uh in the
 
02:41:44.429 --> 02:41:44.439 align:start position:0%
classroom and there are protocols for
 
02:41:48.870 --> 02:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
that uh are those protocols based upon
 
02:41:51.670 --> 02:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
any policy statements that have been
 
02:41:54.710 --> 02:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
designed either by your organization or
 
02:41:57.469 --> 02:41:57.479 align:start position:0%
by the school boards Association so we
 
02:41:59.590 --> 02:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
have consistency throughout the
 
02:42:01.790 --> 02:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
state um you know we've got one of our
 
02:42:03.550 --> 02:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
members who can you give you more
 
02:42:05.630 --> 02:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
details and talking with our members yes
 
02:42:07.070 --> 02:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
they felt as though their school boards
 
02:42:10.110 --> 02:42:10.120 align:start position:0%
had developed policy on this topic and
 
02:42:12.790 --> 02:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
provided them with great guidance and
 
02:42:14.830 --> 02:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines um for these kinds of
 
02:42:14.840 --> 02:42:16.070 align:start position:0%
guidelines um for these kinds of
situations

02:42:16.070 --> 02:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
situations
 
02:42:17.710 --> 02:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
and as I mentioned our independent
 
02:42:20.389 --> 02:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
evaluators um in in the world of special
 
02:42:22.830 --> 02:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
education parents hire them districts
 
02:42:24.990 --> 02:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
hire them they're essential to bringing
 
02:42:27.429 --> 02:42:27.439 align:start position:0%
their expertise to assessing kids
 
02:42:29.510 --> 02:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
observing kids giving recommendations
 
02:42:33.870 --> 02:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
and consultation on um best practice and
 
02:42:36.190 --> 02:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
input to IEPs and those kinds of
 
02:42:40.269 --> 02:42:40.279 align:start position:0%
things thank you represent dry thank you
 
02:42:41.670 --> 02:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:42:43.630 --> 02:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
question um in a previous hearing we
 
02:42:46.510 --> 02:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
heard about a process that was going on
 
02:42:49.590 --> 02:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
um without statute uh behind it and they
 
02:42:51.710 --> 02:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
asked for the statute to back it up so
 
02:42:53.710 --> 02:42:53.720 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of confused as to whether you
 
02:42:55.469 --> 02:42:55.479 align:start position:0%
know it's nice to have policies with
 
02:42:57.870 --> 02:42:57.880 align:start position:0%
statutes behind it or or operating
 
02:43:00.910 --> 02:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
without them um and I'm wondering why it
 
02:43:03.269 --> 02:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a good idea to put a statute
 
02:43:03.279 --> 02:43:04.550 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a good idea to put a statute
behind

02:43:04.550 --> 02:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
behind
 
02:43:07.309 --> 02:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
it you know I would defer that to the
 
02:43:09.870 --> 02:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
school boards Association I'm not an
 
02:43:13.150 --> 02:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
expert um in that area so I
 
02:43:15.510 --> 02:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I wouldn't want to comment I'm
 
02:43:16.510 --> 02:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
not quite
 
02:43:19.830 --> 02:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
sure we were just basically looking at
 
02:43:22.110 --> 02:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
the bill and the
 
02:43:25.309 --> 02:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
language represent Miler thank you Mr
 
02:43:28.990 --> 02:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for being here
 
02:43:32.590 --> 02:43:32.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm a parent and I just had an IEP
 
02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
that we agreed
 
02:43:37.670 --> 02:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
to what are my rights as a
 
02:43:40.870 --> 02:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
parent to go through to make sure that
 
02:43:44.349 --> 02:43:44.359 align:start position:0%
the IEP is in fact being implemented as
 
02:43:45.990 --> 02:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
we agree to can you can you kind of walk
 
02:43:49.590 --> 02:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
us through from a parent
 
02:43:52.349 --> 02:43:52.359 align:start position:0%
perspective what that means I'm new to
 
02:43:54.790 --> 02:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
this never had it before I'm glad I have
 
02:43:57.710 --> 02:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
some services but I don't really know
 
02:44:00.429 --> 02:44:00.439 align:start position:0%
what my role is can you outline it from
 
02:44:02.230 --> 02:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
a standpoint from your professional
 
02:44:05.469 --> 02:44:05.479 align:start position:0%
experience certainly the parents are
 
02:44:07.870 --> 02:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely essential and intrical to the
 
02:44:11.070 --> 02:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
IEP process um their input should be
 
02:44:13.269 --> 02:44:13.279 align:start position:0%
provided all along the way in the
 
02:44:16.110 --> 02:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
development even before the I team
 
02:44:18.630 --> 02:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
begins even before the development of an
 
02:44:22.670 --> 02:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
IEP begins it's so important to help
 
02:44:26.110 --> 02:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
parents understand um one the kind of
 
02:44:28.990 --> 02:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
disability their child has two what to
 
02:44:31.469 --> 02:44:31.479 align:start position:0%
expect going through the special ed
 
02:44:34.309 --> 02:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
process um and then by the time you get
 
02:44:36.630 --> 02:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
down to you know look at the assessments
 
02:44:39.469 --> 02:44:39.479 align:start position:0%
that are done being able to explain
 
02:44:41.910 --> 02:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
those assessments to parents in
 
02:44:41.920 --> 02:44:42.870 align:start position:0%
those assessments to parents in
userfriendly

02:44:42.870 --> 02:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
userfriendly
 
02:44:46.269 --> 02:44:46.279 align:start position:0%
terms and how we're going to use that
 
02:44:49.870 --> 02:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
information to set some goals um and
 
02:44:51.670 --> 02:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
what kinds of specially designed
 
02:44:54.150 --> 02:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
instruction will your child need based
 
02:44:55.510 --> 02:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
on their
 
02:44:58.309 --> 02:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
disability um and then how are we going
 
02:45:01.630 --> 02:45:01.640 align:start position:0%
to measure that um and I think when you
 
02:45:04.670 --> 02:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
when you look at Ida it it says parents
 
02:45:07.910 --> 02:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
must be an essential part of the IE team
 
02:45:09.830 --> 02:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
they should be given reasonable
 
02:45:12.750 --> 02:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities to observe their child's
 
02:45:16.389 --> 02:45:16.399 align:start position:0%
and any um any any potential placement
 
02:45:19.790 --> 02:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
that they might be in um and I think our
 
02:45:21.710 --> 02:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
school districts are doing a great job
 
02:45:25.590 --> 02:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
of giving that reasonable opportunity
 
02:45:27.870 --> 02:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
obviously there's going to be times when
 
02:45:31.110 --> 02:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh conflict arises and and schools may
 
02:45:34.349 --> 02:45:34.359 align:start position:0%
not disagree they may disagree um but
 
02:45:36.510 --> 02:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
for the most part in in talking with our
 
02:45:38.269 --> 02:45:38.279 align:start position:0%
members and our private schools and our
 
02:45:40.870 --> 02:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
Public Schools they really felt as
 
02:45:43.750 --> 02:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
though those processes were in
 
02:45:46.429 --> 02:45:46.439 align:start position:0%
place um
 
02:45:49.910 --> 02:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
so if thank you for that explanation so
 
02:45:52.670 --> 02:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
if a parent though does have a
 
02:45:55.429 --> 02:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
disagreement with the axis based upon
 
02:45:58.389 --> 02:45:58.399 align:start position:0%
the plan and as you've outlined if a
 
02:46:03.510 --> 02:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
parent has a disagreement with access to
 
02:46:06.750 --> 02:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
the classroom what is the process for
 
02:46:09.950 --> 02:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
appeal that a parent might go through to
 
02:46:13.309 --> 02:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
gain greater access to the classroom my
 
02:46:14.550 --> 02:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
understanding it would be would be the
 
02:46:18.389 --> 02:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
same as any other policy going to the
 
02:46:21.590 --> 02:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
the principal the superintendent school
 
02:46:24.590 --> 02:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
board and working through it that way
 
02:46:27.750 --> 02:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative
 
02:46:30.910 --> 02:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
cordelli um thank you
 
02:46:36.469 --> 02:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
um uh I remember distinctly um a hearing
 
02:46:38.910 --> 02:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
um I believe it was down in the Senate
 
02:46:43.349 --> 02:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
um a floor below us um with a specialed
 
02:46:46.469 --> 02:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
parent who was a lawyer
 
02:46:49.830 --> 02:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
but was having trouble navigating the
 
02:46:51.710 --> 02:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
process that we just talked
 
02:46:56.710 --> 02:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
about um do you believe that the process
 
02:47:02.630 --> 02:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
is clearly laid out for parents um in a
 
02:47:05.190 --> 02:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
guide a pamphlet in some kind of
 
02:47:08.750 --> 02:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
material that is made available to
 
02:47:11.830 --> 02:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
them I think the process is laid out
 
02:47:14.990 --> 02:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
very clearly it's not easy to understand
 
02:47:16.710 --> 02:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
and I think districts do that in a
 
02:47:18.630 --> 02:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
variety of ways with a variety of
 
02:47:21.429 --> 02:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
Partners the parent information center
 
02:47:24.550 --> 02:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
um we are always sending out information
 
02:47:28.670 --> 02:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
to our members to distribute um to
 
02:47:31.670 --> 02:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
parents via the special eded Min the um
 
02:47:35.950 --> 02:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
parent information center um many of our
 
02:47:39.550 --> 02:47:39.560 align:start position:0%
districts have parent groups that
 
02:47:42.750 --> 02:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
support one another you know that are
 
02:47:44.630 --> 02:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
coordinated with the district to help
 
02:47:47.950 --> 02:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
parents par s understand the process and
 
02:47:50.550 --> 02:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
um helping to educate them and support
 
02:47:53.710 --> 02:47:53.720 align:start position:0%
them it it's difficult enough to have a
 
02:47:56.030 --> 02:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
child with AB disability but to
 
02:47:57.550 --> 02:47:57.560 align:start position:0%
understand all the timelines and
 
02:48:00.630 --> 02:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
paperwork and signatures it it can be
 
02:48:02.550 --> 02:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
overwhelming um and I think we can
 
02:48:06.550 --> 02:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
always do better um that you know it's
 
02:48:08.590 --> 02:48:08.600 align:start position:0%
not it's not perfect but the process is
 
02:48:11.790 --> 02:48:11.800 align:start position:0%
clearly outlined yeah go ahead um thank
 
02:48:16.830 --> 02:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
you um in the proc process um I know
 
02:48:20.469 --> 02:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
that there is a a special education
 
02:48:23.070 --> 02:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
database and I cannot remember the
 
02:48:26.950 --> 02:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
acronym I too many yes right yes um
 
02:48:30.309 --> 02:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
thank you um do you think that the
 
02:48:32.830 --> 02:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
process and
 
02:48:39.429 --> 02:48:39.439 align:start position:0%
tracking of a child through the process
 
02:48:43.349 --> 02:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
is accurately captured um and data is
 
02:48:45.910 --> 02:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
available on track tracking a child
 
02:48:49.910 --> 02:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:53.030 --> 02:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
database you know I'm not a current user
 
02:48:55.190 --> 02:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
of the nessus system and nessus is the
 
02:48:57.510 --> 02:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire special education
 
02:49:00.590 --> 02:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
information system and that's where all
 
02:49:03.870 --> 02:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
of the Special Education data is
 
02:49:06.990 --> 02:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
stored um I think districts and our
 
02:49:09.830 --> 02:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
private special education schools do a
 
02:49:13.230 --> 02:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
great job on uh collecting data as
 
02:49:16.070 --> 02:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
related to student ress and their
 
02:49:17.910 --> 02:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
reports and that's typically done in a
 
02:49:20.910 --> 02:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
variety of different ways um nesus is is
 
02:49:24.190 --> 02:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
one place to store your progress report
 
02:49:25.870 --> 02:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
um but I think most of our school
 
02:49:29.269 --> 02:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
systems have pretty robust uh ways in
 
02:49:32.750 --> 02:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
which they're tracking kids uh progress
 
02:49:34.830 --> 02:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
in a variety of different ways as we all
 
02:49:36.590 --> 02:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
know we don't do that with just one
 
02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
assessment and often time it's kind of
 
02:49:40.510 --> 02:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
especially with kids with disabilities
 
02:49:43.110 --> 02:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's benchmarking along the way and many
 
02:49:45.150 --> 02:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
of them are involved with some pretty
 
02:49:47.990 --> 02:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
specialized um types of Assessments
 
02:49:49.910 --> 02:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
whether it be a specialized reading
 
02:49:53.110 --> 02:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
program which wouldn't be in nessus or
 
02:49:55.349 --> 02:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
you know specialized behavioral
 
02:49:57.750 --> 02:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
intervention interventions which
 
02:50:00.670 --> 02:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a nessus so um you know I
 
02:50:02.550 --> 02:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
think ness's is fine in terms of the
 
02:50:05.150 --> 02:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
basic kind of Statewide data but in
 
02:50:08.269 --> 02:50:08.279 align:start position:0%
terms of Rich robust student progress
 
02:50:11.790 --> 02:50:11.800 align:start position:0%
that probably wouldn't be the system to
 
02:50:13.349 --> 02:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
find that kind of
 
02:50:16.469 --> 02:50:16.479 align:start position:0%
information further questions represent
 
02:50:18.389 --> 02:50:18.399 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you and thank you for
 
02:50:21.590 --> 02:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question with inclusion these
 
02:50:24.070 --> 02:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
students are often in uh the larger
 
02:50:26.190 --> 02:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
classroom area it's not not just the
 
02:50:29.910 --> 02:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
resource area or uh special ed room I
 
02:50:31.070 --> 02:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
mean that
 
02:50:35.229 --> 02:50:35.239 align:start position:0%
that's doesn't happen a lot anymore um
 
02:50:39.790 --> 02:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
and so the school policy uh it seems to
 
02:50:42.309 --> 02:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
me that the one for special Edge
 
02:50:45.229 --> 02:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
shouldn't override the school policy for
 
02:50:48.590 --> 02:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
someone who's a parent in a regular Ed
 
02:50:52.630 --> 02:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
classroom uh from should be similar or
 
02:50:55.950 --> 02:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
the same uh is that true that would be
 
02:50:57.510 --> 02:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding and again we've got one
 
02:50:58.990 --> 02:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
of our members who can speak
 
02:51:01.389 --> 02:51:01.399 align:start position:0%
specifically but you know my
 
02:51:03.469 --> 02:51:03.479 align:start position:0%
understanding is that there are policies
 
02:51:06.429 --> 02:51:06.439 align:start position:0%
related to school visitors and classroom
 
02:51:08.469 --> 02:51:08.479 align:start position:0%
observations and that's for all
 
02:51:12.070 --> 02:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
kids um and that we you know special ed
 
02:51:13.990 --> 02:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
kids are General Ed kids and as you said
 
02:51:16.990 --> 02:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
they're in many kids are in the General
 
02:51:18.950 --> 02:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
Ed setting for the vast majority of
 
02:51:21.110 --> 02:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
their day um and many times their
 
02:51:23.590 --> 02:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
special education services are provided
 
02:51:27.429 --> 02:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
in the General Ed classroom um so my
 
02:51:29.830 --> 02:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it is a policy
 
02:51:32.469 --> 02:51:32.479 align:start position:0%
connected to all
 
02:51:35.269 --> 02:51:35.279 align:start position:0%
kids are would you believe there should
 
02:51:37.229 --> 02:51:37.239 align:start position:0%
be exceptions to that for example I had
 
02:51:40.910 --> 02:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
a school where we frowned on parents
 
02:51:43.389 --> 02:51:43.399 align:start position:0%
coming in the first several week or so
 
02:51:46.110 --> 02:51:46.120 align:start position:0%
of kindergarten often times that was
 
02:51:47.670 --> 02:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
very difficult for the kindergarten
 
02:51:49.469 --> 02:51:49.479 align:start position:0%
teacher have mother or father sitting
 
02:51:52.990 --> 02:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
there and and we also had a policy where
 
02:51:56.710 --> 02:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
you don't come in during testing week um
 
02:51:59.150 --> 02:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
uh we there's a number of like policies
 
02:52:01.469 --> 02:52:01.479 align:start position:0%
but we also saw do you believe that
 
02:52:03.309 --> 02:52:03.319 align:start position:0%
there should be some exceptions to the
 
02:52:06.309 --> 02:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
school district policy to allow for
 
02:52:09.190 --> 02:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
example a parent to come in who has a
 
02:52:12.190 --> 02:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
child that's uh handicapped maybe during
 
02:52:13.830 --> 02:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
that first week of school while that
 
02:52:15.429 --> 02:52:15.439 align:start position:0%
child's in can
 
02:52:16.950 --> 02:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
I think those kinds of things I mean if
 
02:52:18.550 --> 02:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
there needs to be something built into
 
02:52:21.830 --> 02:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
an IEP specific for one child yeah that
 
02:52:24.030 --> 02:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
can certainly be done that's that's what
 
02:52:26.670 --> 02:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
I wanted to hear thank you represent
 
02:52:29.309 --> 02:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
leus thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:52:32.349 --> 02:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
question um you were talking about one
 
02:52:35.910 --> 02:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
of your objections which I understand
 
02:52:38.510 --> 02:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
that parents coming in can actually be
 
02:52:40.670 --> 02:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
disruptive if they are there a long time
 
02:52:43.750 --> 02:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
Etc and I'm wondering if the phrase in
 
02:52:43.760 --> 02:52:46.469 align:start position:0%
Etc and I'm wondering if the phrase in
here

02:52:46.469 --> 02:52:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:50.469 --> 02:52:50.479 align:start position:0%
um except where it says um they can't
 
02:52:53.070 --> 02:52:53.080 align:start position:0%
impose conditions or restrictions except
 
02:52:55.469 --> 02:52:55.479 align:start position:0%
those necessary to ensure the and it
 
02:52:58.550 --> 02:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
says Integrity of the program and I'm
 
02:53:01.229 --> 02:53:01.239 align:start position:0%
wondering if Integrity of the program
 
02:53:05.110 --> 02:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
would cover those conditions so that a
 
02:53:06.910 --> 02:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
parent couldn't come and be you know be
 
02:53:09.830 --> 02:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
there so long as to be disruptive or Etc
 
02:53:13.150 --> 02:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
do you think does that
 
02:53:16.469 --> 02:53:16.479 align:start position:0%
work could did you restate the question
 
02:53:19.630 --> 02:53:19.640 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I know it's and do you have
 
02:53:23.110 --> 02:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
the bill in front of you no I don't okay
 
02:53:25.630 --> 02:53:25.640 align:start position:0%
so it's the section that talks about um
 
02:53:27.710 --> 02:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
School District shall impose no
 
02:53:30.429 --> 02:53:30.439 align:start position:0%
conditions or restrictions on such
 
02:53:33.590 --> 02:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
observations except those necessary too
 
02:53:36.030 --> 02:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
and then it has a list of things and one
 
02:53:38.910 --> 02:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
of the things is integrity of the
 
02:53:42.830 --> 02:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:47.790 --> 02:53:47.800 align:start position:0%
use the IDE a that um the Integrity of
 
02:53:50.309 --> 02:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
the program can't be disrupted and I'm
 
02:53:53.990 --> 02:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
wondering if you think that phrase would
 
02:53:55.469 --> 02:53:55.479 align:start position:0%
cover those
 
02:53:58.389 --> 02:53:58.399 align:start position:0%
instances where having the parents there
 
02:54:00.870 --> 02:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
too much or too long or whatever at the
 
02:54:03.190 --> 02:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
wrong times would be
 
02:54:05.469 --> 02:54:05.479 align:start position:0%
disruptive yeah I I think that term
 
02:54:09.110 --> 02:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
covers that definitely okay thank you
 
02:54:10.510 --> 02:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
 
02:54:12.150 --> 02:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any hands thank you
 
02:54:13.990 --> 02:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
very much thank you I'd like to invite
 
02:54:29.190 --> 02:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:31.710 --> 02:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
bigford hello uh my name is Jessica
 
02:54:34.190 --> 02:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
Bickford um I fill a couple of different
 
02:54:36.630 --> 02:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
roles I am a parent of a child with
 
02:54:39.750 --> 02:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
special needs but I am also a assistant
 
02:54:43.150 --> 02:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
superintendent for sau53 public
 
02:54:46.269 --> 02:54:46.279 align:start position:0%
schools um much of what I have to say is
 
02:54:49.590 --> 02:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
similar to what uh Jane had just said
 
02:54:51.830 --> 02:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
not necessarily for or against in
 
02:54:53.870 --> 02:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
particular but just I would like you to
 
02:54:55.429 --> 02:54:55.439 align:start position:0%
have careful consideration of some of
 
02:54:58.469 --> 02:54:58.479 align:start position:0%
the language that's in the bill um I
 
02:55:00.389 --> 02:55:00.399 align:start position:0%
would like to reiterate that many
 
02:55:04.150 --> 02:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
schools already have policies that cover
 
02:55:07.269 --> 02:55:07.279 align:start position:0%
visitors and those kind of things to the
 
02:55:09.550 --> 02:55:09.560 align:start position:0%
school to the classroom setting to
 
02:55:12.110 --> 02:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
programs after school programs those
 
02:55:14.630 --> 02:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
kinds of things so just consideration
 
02:55:17.670 --> 02:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
that it might be a bill that may not be
 
02:55:21.510 --> 02:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
needed or consideration to expand Beyond
 
02:55:23.710 --> 02:55:23.720 align:start position:0%
just special education because this bill
 
02:55:25.950 --> 02:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
just covers special education and I'm
 
02:55:28.550 --> 02:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
wondering why it might only cover
 
02:55:30.630 --> 02:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
special education and not general
 
02:55:33.309 --> 02:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
education which would Encompass special
 
02:55:36.349 --> 02:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
education um it does raise some concerns
 
02:55:39.110 --> 02:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
around potential furpa violations for
 
02:55:42.110 --> 02:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
other students in special programs so if
 
02:55:45.030 --> 02:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
a parent is coming into observe a
 
02:55:48.030 --> 02:55:48.040 align:start position:0%
special program there may very well be
 
02:55:50.750 --> 02:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
other students in that program who have
 
02:55:53.590 --> 02:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
severe disabilities medical issues
 
02:55:55.750 --> 02:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
sensitive things that they have to deal
 
02:55:57.590 --> 02:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
with that are part of their own program
 
02:55:59.670 --> 02:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
during the school day and that parent
 
02:56:02.269 --> 02:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
may not necessarily have the right to
 
02:56:04.590 --> 02:56:04.600 align:start position:0%
observe or have any knowledge about that
 
02:56:07.790 --> 02:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
child um during that same time so just
 
02:56:11.229 --> 02:56:11.239 align:start position:0%
consideration of that as well
 
02:56:15.550 --> 02:56:15.560 align:start position:0%
um there are mechanism in place through
 
02:56:18.309 --> 02:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
the IEP team process that would allow
 
02:56:20.950 --> 02:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
parent to have some of this information
 
02:56:23.510 --> 02:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
or the team could develop a plan for the
 
02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
parent to come in and do some of those
 
02:56:27.990 --> 02:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
kind of observations there's also uh
 
02:56:30.790 --> 02:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
procedures involved for outside agencies
 
02:56:33.630 --> 02:56:33.640 align:start position:0%
or evaluators to come in and observe
 
02:56:35.389 --> 02:56:35.399 align:start position:0%
students and their programs and collect
 
02:56:37.670 --> 02:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
data that will be used for IEP
 
02:56:41.269 --> 02:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
development and program development um
 
02:56:44.190 --> 02:56:44.200 align:start position:0%
and I just would like to say that I I I
 
02:56:46.790 --> 02:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
think it's because we're in the business
 
02:56:49.150 --> 02:56:49.160 align:start position:0%
of people in education you're going to
 
02:56:50.750 --> 02:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
have different performances no matter
 
02:56:52.990 --> 02:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
where you go throughout the state I
 
02:56:54.790 --> 02:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
personally have had parents come into my
 
02:56:56.870 --> 02:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
classroom when I was a teacher without a
 
02:57:00.429 --> 02:57:00.439 align:start position:0%
problem um but it was on good terms we
 
02:57:02.469 --> 02:57:02.479 align:start position:0%
had a good relationship and I think some
 
02:57:05.429 --> 02:57:05.439 align:start position:0%
of the language in this bill appears to
 
02:57:07.190 --> 02:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
have an
 
02:57:10.750 --> 02:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
adversarial context to the language so I
 
02:57:14.870 --> 02:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
just caution that um because it does
 
02:57:17.469 --> 02:57:17.479 align:start position:0%
come across as being a friendly
 
02:57:19.950 --> 02:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
good-natured open door kind of policy
 
02:57:21.670 --> 02:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
which I think was the intent from the
 
02:57:24.190 --> 02:57:24.200 align:start position:0%
hearing uh the testimony that was given
 
02:57:25.830 --> 02:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
but I don't know that it comes across
 
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
that way um so just caution with that as
 
02:57:32.590 --> 02:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much are there any
 
02:57:33.550 --> 02:57:33.560 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:57:33.560 --> 02:57:34.910 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

02:57:34.910 --> 02:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:57:36.990 --> 02:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
perinel thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:57:39.229 --> 02:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
for taking my question in regards to
 
02:57:42.229 --> 02:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
furpa violations if I look on P line 14
 
02:57:43.389 --> 02:57:43.399 align:start position:0%
of the bill I don't know if you have it
 
02:57:45.830 --> 02:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
in front of you but it says
 
02:57:48.510 --> 02:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
um let's see school districts shall
 
02:57:51.070 --> 02:57:51.080 align:start position:0%
impose no conditions and then we move
 
02:57:53.830 --> 02:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
down to line 14 where it says um protect
 
02:57:55.190 --> 02:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
the children in the program from
 
02:57:57.469 --> 02:57:57.479 align:start position:0%
Disclosure by an observer of
 
02:58:00.070 --> 02:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
confidential and personally identifiable
 
02:58:02.429 --> 02:58:02.439 align:start position:0%
information in the rulle making process
 
02:58:04.429 --> 02:58:04.439 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be possible to require a
 
02:58:07.229 --> 02:58:07.239 align:start position:0%
parent to sign some form saying they
 
02:58:10.070 --> 02:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
would not disclose in anything that they
 
02:58:13.990 --> 02:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
saw or observed but I think we may have
 
02:58:15.229 --> 02:58:15.239 align:start position:0%
to be in a position where we get
 
02:58:17.349 --> 02:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
permission from that other parent as
 
02:58:19.429 --> 02:58:19.439 align:start position:0%
well to allow that disclosure of
 
02:58:21.229 --> 02:58:21.239 align:start position:0%
personal information because their their
 
02:58:23.670 --> 02:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
child's rights would be violated um we
 
02:58:26.830 --> 02:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
also can't control what people say even
 
02:58:28.550 --> 02:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
though they sign a non-disclosure
 
02:58:31.269 --> 02:58:31.279 align:start position:0%
agreement or that a privacy agreement of
 
02:58:33.750 --> 02:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
some sort they also have to adhere to
 
02:58:35.469 --> 02:58:35.479 align:start position:0%
those kind of um standards when we go
 
02:58:37.710 --> 02:58:37.720 align:start position:0%
through due process as well however it's
 
02:58:39.910 --> 02:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
not very often followed and we have no
 
02:58:42.710 --> 02:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
recourse as a school to hold that parent
 
02:58:44.590 --> 02:58:44.600 align:start position:0%
accountable or who whoever it might be a
 
02:58:47.750 --> 02:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
visitor or provider um accountable if
 
02:58:50.870 --> 02:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
personal information is shared out y
 
02:58:52.469 --> 02:58:52.479 align:start position:0%
thank you further further questions
 
02:58:54.910 --> 02:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli thank you thank you
 
02:58:58.269 --> 02:58:58.279 align:start position:0%
for being here um uh it's been mentioned
 
02:59:01.110 --> 02:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
that uh districts have observation
 
02:59:03.469 --> 02:59:03.479 align:start position:0%
policies in place most districts let's
 
02:59:07.469 --> 02:59:07.479 align:start position:0%
say um isn't it possible though that
 
02:59:12.910 --> 02:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
those um General observation policies um
 
02:59:14.950 --> 02:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
might restrict
 
02:59:17.030 --> 02:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
observation to the
 
02:59:21.630 --> 02:59:21.640 align:start position:0%
parent and not include for a uh an
 
02:59:24.790 --> 02:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
independent evaluator or consultant and
 
02:59:28.510 --> 02:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
thus the need for some specific um
 
02:59:31.469 --> 02:59:31.479 align:start position:0%
statuto language to allow those people
 
02:59:31.479 --> 02:59:33.070 align:start position:0%
statuto language to allow those people
as

02:59:33.070 --> 02:59:33.080 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:59:35.269 --> 02:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
well I mean I guess it could be it would
 
02:59:37.309 --> 02:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
depend on the school district's policy I
 
02:59:39.750 --> 02:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
don't there's no mandate for us to have
 
02:59:41.309 --> 02:59:41.319 align:start position:0%
that kind of policy in place which might
 
02:59:43.990 --> 02:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
be what you're kind of alluding to um we
 
02:59:45.630 --> 02:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
don't have anything saying that we have
 
02:59:48.229 --> 02:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
to have or welcome visitors to come in
 
02:59:49.910 --> 02:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
and observe those things I think schools
 
02:59:52.550 --> 02:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
choose to do that to cover the that
 
02:59:54.469 --> 02:59:54.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity or that instance when that
 
02:59:57.309 --> 02:59:57.319 align:start position:0%
might happen um I know there's a lot of
 
02:59:59.190 --> 02:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
schools that have eval outside
 
03:00:00.870 --> 03:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
evaluators or Consultants come in on a
 
03:00:04.510 --> 03:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
regular basis um I think it's usually
 
03:00:07.349 --> 03:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
done in collaboration with the teachers
 
03:00:09.990 --> 03:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
union with the administration of that
 
03:00:12.630 --> 03:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
building so that there is a an agreed
 
03:00:17.870 --> 03:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
upon and of positive out Outlook from
 
03:00:19.429 --> 03:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
the beginning right it's not coming in
 
03:00:23.510 --> 03:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
as a gotcha or trying to um find
 
03:00:25.510 --> 03:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
something wrong with a program or a
 
03:00:28.110 --> 03:00:28.120 align:start position:0%
teacher in general so I think there is
 
03:00:30.670 --> 03:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
the possibility for you know it might be
 
03:00:32.349 --> 03:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
a sound reason to have some legislation
 
03:00:33.710 --> 03:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
that says we have to have a policy
 
03:00:36.229 --> 03:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
around this but I just would encourage
 
03:00:38.229 --> 03:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
you to kind of take into consideration
 
03:00:41.429 --> 03:00:41.439 align:start position:0%
all those factors that play into that um
 
03:00:43.870 --> 03:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
and the privacy of kids and is it the
 
03:00:45.950 --> 03:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
program we're evaluating or the teacher
 
03:00:47.550 --> 03:00:47.560 align:start position:0%
that's being evaluated and delivering
 
03:00:49.070 --> 03:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
that program because those are two
 
03:00:51.950 --> 03:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
separate things thank you further
 
03:00:53.830 --> 03:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
question represent
 
03:00:57.550 --> 03:00:57.560 align:start position:0%
leus um you mentioned that it seemed to
 
03:01:02.229 --> 03:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
have an adversarial feel and the that
 
03:01:05.110 --> 03:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
would the question is would you be
 
03:01:09.750 --> 03:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
willing to um make suggestions as how to
 
03:01:13.269 --> 03:01:13.279 align:start position:0%
change the wording so that it is more
 
03:01:16.510 --> 03:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
friendly your open feelings sure I I
 
03:01:19.750 --> 03:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't mind helping um
 
03:01:21.950 --> 03:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
reward some things if you know I felt
 
03:01:21.960 --> 03:01:23.630 align:start position:0%
reward some things if you know I felt
like

03:01:23.630 --> 03:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:01:26.950 --> 03:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
the I guess I agreed or if it was
 
03:01:28.830 --> 03:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
expanded to more than just special ed
 
03:01:30.269 --> 03:01:30.279 align:start position:0%
right I think that's kind of my barrier
 
03:01:32.349 --> 03:01:32.359 align:start position:0%
in this is it's it's just targeting
 
03:01:35.630 --> 03:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
special education and not all students
 
03:01:37.269 --> 03:01:37.279 align:start position:0%
um and I understand the intent like I
 
03:01:38.790 --> 03:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
said I I understand the testimony that
 
03:01:41.070 --> 03:01:41.080 align:start position:0%
was given in why the bill came forward
 
03:01:42.710 --> 03:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
um and it's unfortunate that a parent
 
03:01:44.790 --> 03:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
had to go through that kind of situation
 
03:01:46.830 --> 03:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
when clearly there was a bad
 
03:01:48.469 --> 03:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
relationship involved which may have
 
03:01:50.269 --> 03:01:50.279 align:start position:0%
been the initiating factor for all of
 
03:01:53.110 --> 03:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
that um which is really unfortunate um
 
03:01:54.910 --> 03:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
but yeah I would be happy to help with
 
03:01:57.670 --> 03:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
word smithing or you know putting it in
 
03:01:59.590 --> 03:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
a more positive light Absol thank you
 
03:02:02.469 --> 03:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
very much I I do have a question then
 
03:02:05.670 --> 03:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
represent beler um as previous teacher
 
03:02:08.070 --> 03:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
principal administrator
 
03:02:11.510 --> 03:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
myself our schools had this already in
 
03:02:14.429 --> 03:02:14.439 align:start position:0%
place so is this legislation
 
03:02:16.990 --> 03:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
necessary and that's my word of
 
03:02:19.269 --> 03:02:19.279 align:start position:0%
consideration and caution is that I
 
03:02:20.870 --> 03:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
think it might be redundant I think
 
03:02:22.870 --> 03:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
there are already many schools that have
 
03:02:25.110 --> 03:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
these kind of policies in place however
 
03:02:27.229 --> 03:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
I don't know that we are forced to have
 
03:02:29.389 --> 03:02:29.399 align:start position:0%
them in place so I get the there was
 
03:02:31.150 --> 03:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
some comments made earlier around should
 
03:02:32.950 --> 03:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
we have legislation if we have that
 
03:02:35.389 --> 03:02:35.399 align:start position:0%
expectation so I could see why there
 
03:02:37.030 --> 03:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
might want to be some legislations
 
03:02:38.590 --> 03:02:38.600 align:start position:0%
legislation saying schools have to have
 
03:02:42.030 --> 03:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
a policy um but I would just encourage
 
03:02:44.030 --> 03:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
that maybe we could expand that and not
 
03:02:45.590 --> 03:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
have it be pigeon hold into special
 
03:02:47.910 --> 03:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
education thank you represent
 
03:02:49.910 --> 03:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:02:51.150 --> 03:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I just wanted to
 
03:02:53.870 --> 03:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
follow up on on the uh the regular
 
03:02:56.510 --> 03:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
classroom versus the special ed portion
 
03:03:00.110 --> 03:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
of of that because certainly I don't I
 
03:03:02.510 --> 03:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
don't inherently see any problem with
 
03:03:04.389 --> 03:03:04.399 align:start position:0%
parents being able to observe a regular
 
03:03:04.399 --> 03:03:06.510 align:start position:0%
parents being able to observe a regular
classroom

03:03:06.510 --> 03:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
03:03:08.510 --> 03:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
either but given the inherent
 
03:03:10.150 --> 03:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities in special education
 
03:03:11.830 --> 03:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
students does it not make some degree of
 
03:03:13.550 --> 03:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
sense that parents might have a greater
 
03:03:16.309 --> 03:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
interest in that population in observing
 
03:03:19.750 --> 03:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
them um absolutely because there there
 
03:03:21.590 --> 03:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
are unique programming and it's very
 
03:03:23.670 --> 03:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
individualized and so and and they may
 
03:03:26.990 --> 03:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
very well provide fantastic input on why
 
03:03:29.830 --> 03:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
maybe a team is struggling with student
 
03:03:32.030 --> 03:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
progress or maybe there's an issue going
 
03:03:33.990 --> 03:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
on that they are very key Partners in
 
03:03:37.510 --> 03:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
helping solve um I am in no way against
 
03:03:39.030 --> 03:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
family participation in that and
 
03:03:41.910 --> 03:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
observation I think I would just not
 
03:03:43.590 --> 03:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
want it to be only representative of
 
03:03:45.630 --> 03:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
special education because there is Great
 
03:03:47.790 --> 03:03:47.800 align:start position:0%
Value in having parent presence and
 
03:03:49.309 --> 03:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
Community presence in the school
 
03:03:51.910 --> 03:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
buildings that I think is uh potentially
 
03:03:53.830 --> 03:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
underutilized and underappreciated I
 
03:03:55.110 --> 03:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
think it's a really good thing to have a
 
03:03:57.150 --> 03:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
positive and open relationship with your
 
03:03:59.830 --> 03:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
parents and community members um but yes
 
03:04:02.429 --> 03:04:02.439 align:start position:0%
there there would be a vested um
 
03:04:04.910 --> 03:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity and great opportunity missed
 
03:04:06.110 --> 03:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
if parents weren't involved in those
 
03:04:07.870 --> 03:04:07.880 align:start position:0%
specialty programs for
 
03:04:09.790 --> 03:04:09.800 align:start position:0%
sure thank you very much further
 
03:04:11.389 --> 03:04:11.399 align:start position:0%
questions representative Tanner thank
 
03:04:13.229 --> 03:04:13.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question I
 
03:04:15.790 --> 03:04:15.800 align:start position:0%
would think that it would be important
 
03:04:18.870 --> 03:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
um I know from a from a teacher's aspect
 
03:04:20.830 --> 03:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
be important to kind of set up the
 
03:04:24.309 --> 03:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
visitation beforehand um and it seems
 
03:04:27.309 --> 03:04:27.319 align:start position:0%
like with no restriction or conditions
 
03:04:29.469 --> 03:04:29.479 align:start position:0%
uh the person could show up at the
 
03:04:32.710 --> 03:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
schoolhouse door and say I demand to be
 
03:04:36.750 --> 03:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
in class X Y and Z or whatever is that
 
03:04:38.510 --> 03:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
do you see that is a problem with this
 
03:04:40.870 --> 03:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
no conditions or
 
03:04:43.950 --> 03:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
restrictions I mean it could um um I
 
03:04:46.590 --> 03:04:46.600 align:start position:0%
think the the bill as written also
 
03:04:48.110 --> 03:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
allows the opportunity for the school
 
03:04:49.670 --> 03:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
district to create their own policy
 
03:04:51.630 --> 03:04:51.640 align:start position:0%
around it so the school district could
 
03:04:54.830 --> 03:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
create the policy that says has to be
 
03:04:57.150 --> 03:04:57.160 align:start position:0%
pre-arranged you know no it could be
 
03:04:59.150 --> 03:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
three days in advance or something um
 
03:05:00.110 --> 03:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that that would be
 
03:05:02.630 --> 03:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
unreasonable I think there's similar um
 
03:05:05.510 --> 03:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
language that's embedded into the idea
 
03:05:05.520 --> 03:05:07.309 align:start position:0%
language that's embedded into the idea
around

03:05:07.309 --> 03:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
around
 
03:05:10.349 --> 03:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
um you know advanced notice of things
 
03:05:12.070 --> 03:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
like advanced notice of meetings you
 
03:05:15.150 --> 03:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
know we have so many hour or days um or
 
03:05:17.550 --> 03:05:17.560 align:start position:0%
weeks to respond to certain things and I
 
03:05:19.309 --> 03:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
think that would this would kind of be
 
03:05:22.830 --> 03:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
open to a similar lens um so I'm not
 
03:05:24.510 --> 03:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily worried or concerned about
 
03:05:25.750 --> 03:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
that because the school district may
 
03:05:27.870 --> 03:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
very well build that into a policy that
 
03:05:31.150 --> 03:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
they create thank you further questions
 
03:05:34.590 --> 03:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yes thank you um I'd
 
03:05:36.870 --> 03:05:36.880 align:start position:0%

03:06:16.110 --> 03:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
offering me that opportunity the school
 
03:06:17.790 --> 03:06:17.800 align:start position:0%
boards Association does have a number of
 
03:06:19.510 --> 03:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
policies and I think it might have been
 
03:06:21.030 --> 03:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
last session or the session previous
 
03:06:23.710 --> 03:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
where we had a lengthy discussion uh at
 
03:06:26.030 --> 03:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
this committee about uh policies that
 
03:06:28.429 --> 03:06:28.439 align:start position:0%
are already uh available for school
 
03:06:31.190 --> 03:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
districts in terms of visitor policies
 
03:06:33.990 --> 03:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
observation policies surveillance video
 
03:06:37.910 --> 03:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
recording Etc um there's also policies
 
03:06:40.229 --> 03:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
around special education evaluation in
 
03:06:42.790 --> 03:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
listening to people talk a little bit um
 
03:06:45.830 --> 03:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
about this bill it I'm a little confused
 
03:06:47.429 --> 03:06:47.439 align:start position:0%
about the Catalyst for this bill whether
 
03:06:51.429 --> 03:06:51.439 align:start position:0%
it is wanting observation to assess uh
 
03:06:52.750 --> 03:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not a student is making
 
03:06:54.630 --> 03:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
adequate progress in their program or
 
03:06:56.269 --> 03:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
whether it is part of an
 
03:07:00.150 --> 03:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
eligibility observation process um there
 
03:07:03.229 --> 03:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
are policies already about observations
 
03:07:05.150 --> 03:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
as part of the special ed eligibility
 
03:07:08.830 --> 03:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
process um there are certain evaluators
 
03:07:10.950 --> 03:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire statute for special
 
03:07:14.309 --> 03:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
education evaluation who are um
 
03:07:16.790 --> 03:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate or allowed to complete the
 
03:07:18.429 --> 03:07:18.439 align:start position:0%
observation process as part of a
 
03:07:20.790 --> 03:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
student's eligibility evaluation all of
 
03:07:22.309 --> 03:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
those things would be determined during
 
03:07:24.790 --> 03:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
the evaluation process in terms of who's
 
03:07:26.150 --> 03:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
doing the observation what their
 
03:07:30.550 --> 03:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
qualifications are Etc um there are as I
 
03:07:32.349 --> 03:07:32.359 align:start position:0%
said multiple recommended policies in
 
03:07:34.750 --> 03:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
terms of observation video visitor
 
03:07:36.750 --> 03:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
policies uh
 
03:07:39.190 --> 03:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
Etc the school district also does have
 
03:07:42.750 --> 03:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
to uphold furpa as I think many people
 
03:07:45.830 --> 03:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
have said before me uh in terms of these
 
03:07:48.870 --> 03:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
processes uh the non-disclosure comment
 
03:07:50.790 --> 03:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
I don't there's no policy for that
 
03:07:53.510 --> 03:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
specifically I think uh to the previous
 
03:07:55.150 --> 03:07:55.160 align:start position:0%
speaker's point it would be difficult
 
03:07:58.030 --> 03:07:58.040 align:start position:0%
for a school to ensure that if a person
 
03:08:00.750 --> 03:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
is following a student for a length of
 
03:08:02.389 --> 03:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
time during the day that that would be
 
03:08:04.469 --> 03:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
very difficult to ensure that other
 
03:08:07.550 --> 03:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
students privacies uh are protected and
 
03:08:09.469 --> 03:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
those are not recommended options for
 
03:08:11.309 --> 03:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
schools to do they are required to
 
03:08:15.190 --> 03:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
uphold student PR y um and that includes
 
03:08:17.349 --> 03:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
for outside observers Etc but yes there
 
03:08:19.590 --> 03:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
are policies for those things do we have
 
03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
access to are these on the web these
 
03:08:23.830 --> 03:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
policies to speak to or do we have to um
 
03:08:25.269 --> 03:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
I can give them to you again I'm pretty
 
03:08:27.070 --> 03:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
sure um we can pull them from last
 
03:08:30.309 --> 03:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
year's or the year before policies um in
 
03:08:33.510 --> 03:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
terms of that and I also just um want to
 
03:08:38.070 --> 03:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
be clear that um parent training for
 
03:08:41.870 --> 03:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
example parent participation in the IEP
 
03:08:44.510 --> 03:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
process is very high I in terms of the
 
03:08:46.510 --> 03:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
bar uh in New Hampshire in most
 
03:08:48.150 --> 03:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
districts in terms of ensuring that
 
03:08:49.550 --> 03:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
parents have the opportunity to
 
03:08:51.349 --> 03:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
participate in the development of all of
 
03:08:54.910 --> 03:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
this um and being able to vet out
 
03:08:57.110 --> 03:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
whether a child is making appropriate
 
03:08:58.910 --> 03:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
progress again the language in this bill
 
03:09:01.229 --> 03:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
is confusing because effective progress
 
03:09:02.990 --> 03:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
is not used anywhere in special ed
 
03:09:04.670 --> 03:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
language in the state it's appropriate
 
03:09:06.630 --> 03:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
or adequate in light of the child's
 
03:09:08.429 --> 03:09:08.439 align:start position:0%
unique circumstances that's not anywhere
 
03:09:10.469 --> 03:09:10.479 align:start position:0%
in this bill um so it's a little
 
03:09:12.389 --> 03:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
confusing about whether the intent of
 
03:09:14.750 --> 03:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
the bill is to provide observation
 
03:09:16.550 --> 03:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
opportunities to assess a child's
 
03:09:18.630 --> 03:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
progress or whether or not the program
 
03:09:21.070 --> 03:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
is appropriate for the student or
 
03:09:23.190 --> 03:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
whether it is to provide opportunities
 
03:09:25.229 --> 03:09:25.239 align:start position:0%
for training for parents and schools to
 
03:09:26.990 --> 03:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
work collaboratively to make sure
 
03:09:28.590 --> 03:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
there's a good carryover between home
 
03:09:32.229 --> 03:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
and school um with any uh interventions
 
03:09:33.429 --> 03:09:33.439 align:start position:0%
that are happening for a particular
 
03:09:35.150 --> 03:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
student thank you are there any other
 
03:09:37.590 --> 03:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative Milo thank you
 
03:09:41.510 --> 03:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for clarifying
 
03:09:44.229 --> 03:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
these issues I want you to put sure sped
 
03:09:47.830 --> 03:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
hat on for a moment um because I think
 
03:09:50.990 --> 03:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
the issue once a parent enters into an
 
03:09:54.670 --> 03:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
understanding of an IEP there is an
 
03:09:57.190 --> 03:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
obvious concern about what happens to
 
03:09:59.830 --> 03:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
their child in the special
 
03:10:03.229 --> 03:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
programs throughout the once the program
 
03:10:06.349 --> 03:10:06.359 align:start position:0%
is instituted what is the reporting
 
03:10:08.910 --> 03:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
process what how does a
 
03:10:12.030 --> 03:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
parent understand whether or not the
 
03:10:14.070 --> 03:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
intervention and the program that's been
 
03:10:17.990 --> 03:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
created for my child is is working what
 
03:10:20.349 --> 03:10:20.359 align:start position:0%
what's what's the feedback loop how how
 
03:10:24.269 --> 03:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
am I engaged as a parent in this process
 
03:10:26.750 --> 03:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um built into
 
03:10:29.710 --> 03:10:29.720 align:start position:0%
every IEP is a section under every
 
03:10:31.670 --> 03:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
single goal in terms of how progress
 
03:10:34.070 --> 03:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
will be reported to the parent and how
 
03:10:35.710 --> 03:10:35.720 align:start position:0%
frequently progress will be reported to
 
03:10:38.110 --> 03:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
the parent that is different depending
 
03:10:39.469 --> 03:10:39.479 align:start position:0%
on the student and depending on the
 
03:10:42.110 --> 03:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
student's program it's not uncommon for
 
03:10:44.269 --> 03:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
schools and families who have a strong
 
03:10:46.190 --> 03:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
relationship to set up for examp this is
 
03:10:48.030 --> 03:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
an example it's not a requirement a
 
03:10:49.910 --> 03:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
monthly progress meeting with the IEP
 
03:10:51.469 --> 03:10:51.479 align:start position:0%
team to sit down and go over what's
 
03:10:53.229 --> 03:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
happened over the past month and talk
 
03:10:54.750 --> 03:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
about what is working and what is not
 
03:10:57.750 --> 03:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
working um it's not uncommon for those
 
03:10:59.429 --> 03:10:59.439 align:start position:0%
progress reports have to go out to
 
03:11:01.150 --> 03:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
parents at least as frequently as
 
03:11:02.750 --> 03:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
progress is reported to other parents
 
03:11:04.429 --> 03:11:04.439 align:start position:0%
who are not parents of children with
 
03:11:06.429 --> 03:11:06.439 align:start position:0%
special needs so for example if your
 
03:11:08.910 --> 03:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
report card is on a trimester system you
 
03:11:11.389 --> 03:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
have to report out IEP progress goals at
 
03:11:14.550 --> 03:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
least trimester is that a word um or
 
03:11:16.030 --> 03:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
quarter you know if you give a report
 
03:11:18.630 --> 03:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
card every quarter you have to provide
 
03:11:20.469 --> 03:11:20.479 align:start position:0%
progress reports on the students IEP
 
03:11:21.870 --> 03:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
goals and objectives at least every
 
03:11:23.990 --> 03:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
quarter you cannot provide less than
 
03:11:25.670 --> 03:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
what you provide to other students
 
03:11:28.110 --> 03:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
parents thank you you're welcome further
 
03:11:29.950 --> 03:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative P now thank you
 
03:11:31.349 --> 03:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:11:34.550 --> 03:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
question in regards to preventing fura
 
03:11:37.429 --> 03:11:37.439 align:start position:0%
violations what would you do
 
03:11:40.910 --> 03:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
with just an average typical parent
 
03:11:42.870 --> 03:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
volunteer just coming into the class
 
03:11:44.750 --> 03:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
room because they could easily go back
 
03:11:47.830 --> 03:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
out into the community and disclose any
 
03:11:50.750 --> 03:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
situation Behavior student information
 
03:11:55.070 --> 03:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
they wanted and do they um sign a
 
03:11:56.950 --> 03:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure before they volunteer in
 
03:11:59.349 --> 03:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
the classroom thank you for the question
 
03:12:01.469 --> 03:12:01.479 align:start position:0%
um what constitutes a designated
 
03:12:04.110 --> 03:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
volunteer is a local decision at the at
 
03:12:07.590 --> 03:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
the local school board level they often
 
03:12:09.110 --> 03:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
that needs to be defined for things like
 
03:12:10.870 --> 03:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks as you know
 
03:12:13.030 --> 03:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
designated volunteers require background
 
03:12:15.590 --> 03:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
check for certain situations um the
 
03:12:17.309 --> 03:12:17.319 align:start position:0%
difference with those situations might
 
03:12:20.070 --> 03:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
be a couple of things one the intent of
 
03:12:21.950 --> 03:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
this bill seems to be directed
 
03:12:24.349 --> 03:12:24.359 align:start position:0%
specifically at looking at a student's
 
03:12:26.630 --> 03:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
special education programming so I think
 
03:12:28.349 --> 03:12:28.359 align:start position:0%
it just lends itself to believe that the
 
03:12:30.269 --> 03:12:30.279 align:start position:0%
fact is that they would be whoever is
 
03:12:33.309 --> 03:12:33.319 align:start position:0%
observing would have access to knowing
 
03:12:34.710 --> 03:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
that they are observing a special
 
03:12:36.990 --> 03:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
education program versus observing the
 
03:12:39.469 --> 03:12:39.479 align:start position:0%
day-to-day ongoings of the school the
 
03:12:41.510 --> 03:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
second piece is that because designated
 
03:12:44.269 --> 03:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
volunteers are identified at the local
 
03:12:46.150 --> 03:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
level in terms of what that means you
 
03:12:48.870 --> 03:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
are as an administrator deciding what
 
03:12:50.309 --> 03:12:50.319 align:start position:0%
situations are appropriate for a
 
03:12:52.309 --> 03:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
designated volunteer to be a part of
 
03:12:54.469 --> 03:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
you're not just allowing a person to
 
03:12:56.429 --> 03:12:56.439 align:start position:0%
necessarily follow a particular student
 
03:12:58.790 --> 03:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
around for the day so you would be able
 
03:13:01.870 --> 03:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
to set up the situation where hopefully
 
03:13:03.389 --> 03:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
you are setting that up so that it's
 
03:13:05.030 --> 03:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
protective of all the students in terms
 
03:13:07.349 --> 03:13:07.359 align:start position:0%
of people's provision of services it's
 
03:13:08.830 --> 03:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
not that you will never see anything I
 
03:13:10.229 --> 03:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
mean you could certainly be in a school
 
03:13:12.150 --> 03:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
for any number of reasons and see a
 
03:13:14.550 --> 03:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
child is having a behavior challenge and
 
03:13:16.710 --> 03:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
how that is a dealt with can you protect
 
03:13:17.990 --> 03:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
that parent from going out into the
 
03:13:21.550 --> 03:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
community no but to the point previously
 
03:13:23.830 --> 03:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
that I think somebody brought up about
 
03:13:26.309 --> 03:13:26.319 align:start position:0%
stories um of parents and I want to be
 
03:13:27.910 --> 03:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
sensitive to this parents who are
 
03:13:29.830 --> 03:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
willing to come to these committees and
 
03:13:33.550 --> 03:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
share their challenges and um
 
03:13:35.190 --> 03:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
experiences with their own children at
 
03:13:37.110 --> 03:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
the school district level they can share
 
03:13:38.670 --> 03:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
those experiences because they are the
 
03:13:40.469 --> 03:13:40.479 align:start position:0%
parent the school district even if we're
 
03:13:42.510 --> 03:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
sitting behind the parent that's EXP
 
03:13:44.750 --> 03:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
explaining this has no ability to
 
03:13:47.070 --> 03:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
provide any context for that situation
 
03:13:49.670 --> 03:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
or provide any other information about
 
03:13:52.150 --> 03:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
why the parent is has had that
 
03:13:53.990 --> 03:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
experience from a different perspective
 
03:13:56.870 --> 03:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
possibly because of fura so again the
 
03:13:59.349 --> 03:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
parents are disclosing those things um
 
03:14:01.590 --> 03:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
on their own it has nothing to do with
 
03:14:04.070 --> 03:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
the school sort of setting up the
 
03:14:06.150 --> 03:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
situation where that would be uh a
 
03:14:08.710 --> 03:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
violation of the school's ability to
 
03:14:10.429 --> 03:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
maintain the students
 
03:14:12.190 --> 03:14:12.200 align:start position:0%
confidentiality thank you further
 
03:14:14.630 --> 03:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative uh dry and
 
03:14:15.790 --> 03:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
then represent
 
03:14:18.030 --> 03:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
leus thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:14:20.269 --> 03:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question the you had a few
 
03:14:22.590 --> 03:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
minutes ago a a list of policies that
 
03:14:26.349 --> 03:14:26.359 align:start position:0%
you could use as templates right um do
 
03:14:29.550 --> 03:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
any of those have like a stat to backing
 
03:14:32.790 --> 03:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
that there behind them uh thank you for
 
03:14:32.800 --> 03:14:34.710 align:start position:0%
that there behind them uh thank you for
the

03:14:34.710 --> 03:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:14:36.950 --> 03:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
question there are some statutory
 
03:14:38.550 --> 03:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
restrictions in terms of video
 
03:14:40.469 --> 03:14:40.479 align:start position:0%
recordings and things like that which I
 
03:14:42.030 --> 03:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
think I mentioned because in some
 
03:14:44.030 --> 03:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
situations should a parent want to see
 
03:14:45.990 --> 03:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
something that is happening in a
 
03:14:48.030 --> 03:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
particular situation where inperson
 
03:14:50.790 --> 03:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
observation wouldn't be appropriate you
 
03:14:52.229 --> 03:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
could certainly record certain things
 
03:14:54.349 --> 03:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
and the district could maintain so there
 
03:14:56.870 --> 03:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
are statutes behind recordings when
 
03:14:59.469 --> 03:14:59.479 align:start position:0%
recordings can be used um I'm just
 
03:15:01.790 --> 03:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
trying to look quickly at some of the
 
03:15:04.630 --> 03:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
samples um the evaluation process for
 
03:15:06.590 --> 03:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
special education obviously has statutes
 
03:15:08.150 --> 03:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
behind it of which observation is a
 
03:15:11.590 --> 03:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
required aspect of specialed Eligibility
 
03:15:14.150 --> 03:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
um who doing the observation again all
 
03:15:16.750 --> 03:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
of those things are vetted out in the
 
03:15:18.550 --> 03:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
specialed process if you have an
 
03:15:20.670 --> 03:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
observation and a family has an outside
 
03:15:22.710 --> 03:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
evaluator that they want to come in to
 
03:15:25.910 --> 03:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
observe that person's title name
 
03:15:28.110 --> 03:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
qualifications is part of the evaluation
 
03:15:30.510 --> 03:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
determination process you already know
 
03:15:31.950 --> 03:15:31.960 align:start position:0%
that person is coming and the district
 
03:15:33.830 --> 03:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
is working with them to make sure that
 
03:15:35.349 --> 03:15:35.359 align:start position:0%
they're coming at a time that's going to
 
03:15:37.429 --> 03:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
allow them to assess whatever the
 
03:15:38.790 --> 03:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
question is that they're trying to
 
03:15:41.510 --> 03:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
resolve so yes some of them do have
 
03:15:43.510 --> 03:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
statutory backing
 
03:15:43.520 --> 03:15:45.389 align:start position:0%
statutory backing
yes

03:15:45.389 --> 03:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:15:47.309 --> 03:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
represent thank
 
03:15:50.550 --> 03:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
you thank you for answering my question
 
03:15:53.710 --> 03:15:53.720 align:start position:0%
um you had said instead of effective
 
03:15:56.510 --> 03:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
progress you gave two terms one was
 
03:16:00.870 --> 03:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
adequate and I didn't get the other one
 
03:16:02.790 --> 03:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh I I
 
03:16:04.150 --> 03:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
believe what I probably said was
 
03:16:05.750 --> 03:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate in light of the child's
 
03:16:07.269 --> 03:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
unique circumstances which is the
 
03:16:09.750 --> 03:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
special ed law thank you you're welcome
 
03:16:12.590 --> 03:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you very much
 
03:16:15.550 --> 03:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
thank you could you get those sample
 
03:16:17.870 --> 03:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
policies to Jennifer 4 and then she can
 
03:16:20.269 --> 03:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
send them out to us thank
 
03:16:22.269 --> 03:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
03:16:32.110 --> 03:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:34.950 --> 03:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
department hello thank you for taking my
 
03:16:37.269 --> 03:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
um testimony that we are not taking a
 
03:16:39.429 --> 03:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
stance on this bill at all um I am just
 
03:16:40.750 --> 03:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to provide some technical
 
03:16:42.269 --> 03:16:42.279 align:start position:0%
assistance regarding a letter that was
 
03:16:43.950 --> 03:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
put out by the federal office of special
 
03:16:45.830 --> 03:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
education programs regarding
 
03:16:48.150 --> 03:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
observations in the classroom um in May
 
03:16:51.070 --> 03:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
26th of 2004 there was a letter which I
 
03:16:53.189 --> 03:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
will share with the committee um we
 
03:16:55.590 --> 03:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
recently came upon it that discusses it
 
03:16:57.389 --> 03:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
came from the education Law Center and
 
03:16:59.950 --> 03:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
they asked oep to provide an opinion on
 
03:17:01.830 --> 03:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
whether the individuals with Disability
 
03:17:03.429 --> 03:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
Act guarantees parents and their
 
03:17:05.389 --> 03:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
representatives a reasonable opportunity
 
03:17:06.550 --> 03:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
to observe in their children's
 
03:17:08.590 --> 03:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
classrooms and proposed placement
 
03:17:11.389 --> 03:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
options um and there's some really good
 
03:17:12.790 --> 03:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
information in here I think will be
 
03:17:14.269 --> 03:17:14.279 align:start position:0%
helpful to you but the one paragraph
 
03:17:16.389 --> 03:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
that I think um I just want to share is
 
03:17:18.309 --> 03:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
that while Ida expects parents of
 
03:17:20.309 --> 03:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities to have an
 
03:17:22.110 --> 03:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
expanded role in the evaluation and
 
03:17:24.070 --> 03:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
educational placement of their children
 
03:17:25.790 --> 03:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
and be participants along with school
 
03:17:27.670 --> 03:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
Personnel in developing reviewing and
 
03:17:30.150 --> 03:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
revising IEPs for their children neither
 
03:17:31.870 --> 03:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
the statute nor the regulations
 
03:17:34.070 --> 03:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
implementing the idea provide a general
 
03:17:35.950 --> 03:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
entitlement for parents of children with
 
03:17:37.750 --> 03:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities or their professional
 
03:17:39.469 --> 03:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
representatives to observe their
 
03:17:41.030 --> 03:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
children in any current classroom or
 
03:17:42.870 --> 03:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
proposed educational place
 
03:17:44.590 --> 03:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
they do go on to say that they suggest
 
03:17:46.790 --> 03:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
that districts and parents collaborate
 
03:17:48.309 --> 03:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
together so that things like that can be
 
03:17:52.229 --> 03:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
done um and under certain circumstances
 
03:17:53.630 --> 03:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
and when they have an independent
 
03:17:55.710 --> 03:17:55.720 align:start position:0%
evaluation that that would be allowed so
 
03:17:57.110 --> 03:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
I we I just wanted to share that
 
03:17:58.429 --> 03:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
information with you and we will share
 
03:18:00.750 --> 03:18:00.760 align:start position:0%

04:07:43.309 --> 04:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
on one of the challenges especially for
 
04:07:46.710 --> 04:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
Budget committees and and citizens and
 
04:07:49.590 --> 04:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayers is transparency on special
 
04:07:52.469 --> 04:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
education budgets and that's largely
 
04:07:55.550 --> 04:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
driven by uh Privacy Law privacy
 
04:07:58.670 --> 04:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
considerations which I completely agree
 
04:08:00.950 --> 04:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
with and completely
 
04:08:04.670 --> 04:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
respect and so what this bill aims to do
 
04:08:07.950 --> 04:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
is to take the special ed money that's
 
04:08:10.510 --> 04:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
approved within a School District budget
 
04:08:14.429 --> 04:08:14.439 align:start position:0%
and lock it into special education use
 
04:08:15.870 --> 04:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
so if the money is ear marked for
 
04:08:17.429 --> 04:08:17.439 align:start position:0%
special education that's what it can be
 
04:08:19.630 --> 04:08:19.640 align:start position:0%
used for and it cannot be transferred
 
04:08:21.349 --> 04:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
out into regular
 
04:08:25.429 --> 04:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
education or other line items in in the
 
04:08:28.510 --> 04:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
in the budget and I I think that this
 
04:08:31.429 --> 04:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
would be a a good bill it also requires
 
04:08:33.910 --> 04:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
that the district report what their
 
04:08:36.990 --> 04:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
special ed fund balance is at the at the
 
04:08:38.109 --> 04:08:38.119 align:start position:0%
end of the year
 
04:08:43.070 --> 04:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
so that taxpayers and others can um see
 
04:08:45.710 --> 04:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
how that compares to the overall
 
04:08:49.469 --> 04:08:49.479 align:start position:0%
budget that's all I have great wonderful
 
04:08:50.870 --> 04:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh are there any questions of the
 
04:08:52.830 --> 04:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
representative yes representative
 
04:08:55.070 --> 04:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you representative for
 
04:08:58.590 --> 04:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
bringing this uh this afternoon um when
 
04:09:00.429 --> 04:09:00.439 align:start position:0%
you're talking about sh report annually
 
04:09:02.349 --> 04:09:02.359 align:start position:0%
are you talking about that that should
 
04:09:04.510 --> 04:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
be included in their annual
 
04:09:07.189 --> 04:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
report yes yeah so long so long as the
 
04:09:09.750 --> 04:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
information is made readily available
 
04:09:12.149 --> 04:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
publicly uh the form doesn't really
 
04:09:13.630 --> 04:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
matter too much to me so long as it's
 
04:09:16.510 --> 04:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
requestable and easy to
 
04:09:20.550 --> 04:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
get further questions from the
 
04:09:22.830 --> 04:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any hands up in the
 
04:09:24.229 --> 04:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
air thank you very much thank you so
 
04:09:36.510 --> 04:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:36.520 --> 04:09:40.630 align:start position:0%
 
Bickford

04:09:40.630 --> 04:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:42.510 --> 04:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
hello thank you Jessica Bickford uh
 
04:09:44.950 --> 04:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
again sa53 assistant superintendent
 
04:09:48.030 --> 04:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
student services are you uh representing
 
04:09:49.750 --> 04:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
yourself or I'm representing myself yes
 
04:09:51.469 --> 04:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
okay that should be in the record too y
 
04:09:56.630 --> 04:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um I oppose this bill um as
 
04:09:58.990 --> 04:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
school districts already have mechanisms
 
04:10:01.910 --> 04:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
in place to report out expenditures and
 
04:10:05.670 --> 04:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
costs in each of their budget lines so
 
04:10:08.710 --> 04:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
at the at many points during a school
 
04:10:12.269 --> 04:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
year a school board will ask for
 
04:10:12.279 --> 04:10:13.429 align:start position:0%
year a school board will ask for
expenditure

04:10:13.429 --> 04:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
expenditure
 
04:10:17.309 --> 04:10:17.319 align:start position:0%
reports and for end of your reports that
 
04:10:18.550 --> 04:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
show in
 
04:10:22.670 --> 04:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
detail what monies are left in each of
 
04:10:24.389 --> 04:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
the lines and that include special
 
04:10:27.349 --> 04:10:27.359 align:start position:0%
education so as the year goes on school
 
04:10:29.830 --> 04:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
boards are well aware of what monies are
 
04:10:34.349 --> 04:10:34.359 align:start position:0%
currently in their lines what monies are
 
04:10:37.070 --> 04:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
expected to be expended and then what
 
04:10:39.590 --> 04:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
money are expected to be left over or
 
04:10:41.309 --> 04:10:41.319 align:start position:0%
reserved at the end of the
 
04:10:44.790 --> 04:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
year um if there were questions and how
 
04:10:47.349 --> 04:10:47.359 align:start position:0%
much money were those would be uh left
 
04:10:49.149 --> 04:10:49.159 align:start position:0%
in the budget there's already processes
 
04:10:50.790 --> 04:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
in place to address that through the
 
04:10:54.469 --> 04:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
typical Schoolboard process um spending
 
04:10:57.550 --> 04:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
is only done and Allowed by line and uh
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
allocation and description in those
 
04:11:01.229 --> 04:11:01.239 align:start position:0%
lines so when we have a purchase order
 
04:11:04.670 --> 04:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
come in we have to make sure that that
 
04:11:07.469 --> 04:11:07.479 align:start position:0%
activity matches the description Within
 
04:11:11.790 --> 04:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
that line to be spent as it is
 
04:11:14.550 --> 04:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
um line balances have to be reported by
 
04:11:17.030 --> 04:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
October 1 already so I think that's
 
04:11:18.710 --> 04:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
redundant information there's already
 
04:11:20.750 --> 04:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
processes in place school districts
 
04:11:22.830 --> 04:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
already have to report out what was
 
04:11:25.590 --> 04:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
spent what wasn't spent and that has to
 
04:11:28.590 --> 04:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
go into public reports as it already
 
04:11:31.830 --> 04:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
stands thank you are there any questions
 
04:11:33.349 --> 04:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:11:36.109 --> 04:11:36.119 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative cordelli
 
04:11:38.630 --> 04:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um when you say that this is
 
04:11:42.189 --> 04:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
reported out October 1st um who is it
 
04:11:47.070 --> 04:11:47.080 align:start position:0%
reported out to because I think um as I
 
04:11:50.109 --> 04:11:50.119 align:start position:0%
see it the intent of this that is that
 
04:11:52.070 --> 04:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh this information would be readily
 
04:11:55.149 --> 04:11:55.159 align:start position:0%
available to citizens of the
 
04:11:57.910 --> 04:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
district so a variety of different ways
 
04:12:02.870 --> 04:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
so typically by the time June July rolls
 
04:12:04.590 --> 04:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
around at the end of a school year that
 
04:12:06.229 --> 04:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
information is publicly already
 
04:12:07.550 --> 04:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
distributed through the school SCH board
 
04:12:10.429 --> 04:12:10.439 align:start position:0%
meeting process so typically at a school
 
04:12:13.030 --> 04:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
board meeting we would publicly discuss
 
04:12:14.750 --> 04:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
what's left in each of the fund lines
 
04:12:16.990 --> 04:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
because they get an end ofe report so
 
04:12:19.429 --> 04:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
that information is already made public
 
04:12:22.189 --> 04:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
in public minutes um documents things
 
04:12:23.349 --> 04:12:23.359 align:start position:0%
like that through the Schoolboard
 
04:12:25.630 --> 04:12:25.640 align:start position:0%
process and of your reports have those
 
04:12:27.590 --> 04:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
line descriptions and amounts that are
 
04:12:31.710 --> 04:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
left over or that are overe expended or
 
04:12:33.790 --> 04:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
if there had to be line transfers or
 
04:12:36.229 --> 04:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
future line transfers um there would be
 
04:12:38.750 --> 04:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
entries in that that would show why that
 
04:12:42.510 --> 04:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
had to be done um and if questions were
 
04:12:43.550 --> 04:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
arose the board would have an
 
04:12:45.790 --> 04:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to ask or push back or say
 
04:12:49.710 --> 04:12:49.720 align:start position:0%
yes or no on those things um the forms
 
04:12:52.550 --> 04:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
that are submitted in the fall of the
 
04:12:56.030 --> 04:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
following year of a fiscal year um those
 
04:12:59.229 --> 04:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
are the forms that are reported to our
 
04:13:01.590 --> 04:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
our banks our trusts things like that we
 
04:13:04.349 --> 04:13:04.359 align:start position:0%
have to submit Ms forms like the ms25
 
04:13:06.389 --> 04:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
ms27 those are all forms that are
 
04:13:09.910 --> 04:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
submitted um by rules that aren't
 
04:13:12.269 --> 04:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily submitted into a public
 
04:13:14.550 --> 04:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
record Forum but they are public records
 
04:13:16.830 --> 04:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
anyone can ask for those
 
04:13:21.429 --> 04:13:21.439 align:start position:0%
items thank you y uh just some clarifica
 
04:13:23.309 --> 04:13:23.319 align:start position:0%
clarification here for
 
04:13:26.189 --> 04:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
myself we're operating on a fiscal
 
04:13:29.830 --> 04:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
year and are we talking October 1
 
04:13:34.750 --> 04:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
following the fiscal year um and if not
 
04:13:36.149 --> 04:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
how are we accounting for encumbered
 
04:13:39.870 --> 04:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
Monies so that was a question that um
 
04:13:40.950 --> 04:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you that was a question that came
 
04:13:43.469 --> 04:13:43.479 align:start position:0%
up as I was reading this as well is I'm
 
04:13:44.950 --> 04:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
not sure the language in the proposed
 
04:13:47.269 --> 04:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
Bill clarifies if it's the current
 
04:13:50.910 --> 04:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal year or the following fiscal year
 
04:13:53.910 --> 04:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
um so typically it would be the previous
 
04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal year that you're reporting out um
 
04:14:00.070 --> 04:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
from in the fall so this year's school
 
04:14:01.710 --> 04:14:01.720 align:start position:0%
budget operating budget
 
04:14:05.149 --> 04:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
2324 would be reported out in summer and
 
04:14:09.189 --> 04:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
fall of the next fiscal school year um
 
04:14:11.229 --> 04:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
so it gets kind of confusing and I
 
04:14:13.670 --> 04:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear from the bill whether they
 
04:14:16.670 --> 04:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
wanted projections from the current
 
04:14:18.630 --> 04:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
school year budget or if it was a
 
04:14:20.630 --> 04:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
wrap-up from the previous School Year's
 
04:14:23.269 --> 04:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
budget thank you further forur the
 
04:14:24.750 --> 04:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
04:14:26.910 --> 04:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
04:14:30.389 --> 04:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
much thank you uh next card we have on
 
04:14:34.910 --> 04:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:43.469 --> 04:14:43.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:46.109 --> 04:14:46.119 align:start position:0%
a um members of the committee thank you
 
04:14:47.710 --> 04:14:47.720 align:start position:0%
for calling me up I'm just here to
 
04:14:50.710 --> 04:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
provide uh any technical assistance for
 
04:14:52.550 --> 04:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
it to be needed about how these monies
 
04:14:55.510 --> 04:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
are already reported upon are there any
 
04:14:57.309 --> 04:14:57.319 align:start position:0%
questions for the Schoolboard
 
04:14:59.229 --> 04:14:59.239 align:start position:0%
association yes represent D
 
04:15:01.389 --> 04:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:15:03.710 --> 04:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:15:08.269 --> 04:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
so the bill was introduced saying
 
04:15:12.389 --> 04:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
um that it would prohibit money in
 
04:15:13.990 --> 04:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
special education line items from being
 
04:15:15.630 --> 04:15:15.640 align:start position:0%
used for any other
 
04:15:18.550 --> 04:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
purpose and the second speaker just said
 
04:15:20.710 --> 04:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
you already can't spend money in a
 
04:15:23.389 --> 04:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
different category so could you said
 
04:15:24.750 --> 04:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
some light on the
 
04:15:27.830 --> 04:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
current law thank you for the question I
 
04:15:29.990 --> 04:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
mean the school boards Association would
 
04:15:31.950 --> 04:15:31.960 align:start position:0%
be opposed to this language as it is
 
04:15:34.670 --> 04:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
presented currently um again your line
 
04:15:37.550 --> 04:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
item budget is approved by
 
04:15:39.910 --> 04:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
your voters uh the school board
 
04:15:42.229 --> 04:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
obviously is able to transfer make line
 
04:15:44.070 --> 04:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
item transfers as needed those are all
 
04:15:45.469 --> 04:15:45.479 align:start position:0%
approved at school board meetings which
 
04:15:47.469 --> 04:15:47.479 align:start position:0%
are public meetings the Manifest is
 
04:15:50.830 --> 04:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
signed off on um on a regular basis by a
 
04:15:52.950 --> 04:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
school board member that is um
 
04:15:55.149 --> 04:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
designated to sign off on your manifest
 
04:15:57.030 --> 04:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
so you would know where monies are
 
04:16:00.950 --> 04:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
moving around to and from um a line item
 
04:16:03.910 --> 04:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
budget to be recalculated and pushed out
 
04:16:06.429 --> 04:16:06.439 align:start position:0%
publicly that information is available
 
04:16:07.790 --> 04:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
to the public public as part of the
 
04:16:09.630 --> 04:16:09.640 align:start position:0%
school board packet the majority of the
 
04:16:12.550 --> 04:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
time if people want to look at that um
 
04:16:15.510 --> 04:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's also a little concerning because
 
04:16:17.870 --> 04:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not clear based on this bill what
 
04:16:21.149 --> 04:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
would happen how do you account for um
 
04:16:24.109 --> 04:16:24.119 align:start position:0%
services or instructional materials or
 
04:16:25.790 --> 04:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
trainings that
 
04:16:28.630 --> 04:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
influence many students or teachers in a
 
04:16:29.950 --> 04:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
district that are not solely in your
 
04:16:31.510 --> 04:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
1200 lines which are your special
 
04:16:34.830 --> 04:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
edlines things like um training for
 
04:16:37.550 --> 04:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
regular education teachers in terms of
 
04:16:38.750 --> 04:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
you know working with students with
 
04:16:40.349 --> 04:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
special needs or particular areas
 
04:16:42.750 --> 04:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
equipment building changes Etc that
 
04:16:44.229 --> 04:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
would need to be taken into account that
 
04:16:45.910 --> 04:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
may not necessarily just be under your
 
04:16:49.950 --> 04:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
1200 lines I'm not sure what situation
 
04:16:52.429 --> 04:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
is the Catalyst for this particular
 
04:16:54.070 --> 04:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
language or whether there's a concern
 
04:16:56.189 --> 04:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
that there's specialed money that's not
 
04:16:58.070 --> 04:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
being expended typically we don't see
 
04:16:59.790 --> 04:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
that problem it's usually the reverse
 
04:17:01.469 --> 04:17:01.479 align:start position:0%
that there's not enough special ed money
 
04:17:03.990 --> 04:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
to expend so I don't know of many
 
04:17:07.109 --> 04:17:07.119 align:start position:0%
situations where this has happened thank
 
04:17:09.309 --> 04:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
you thank you further further questions
 
04:17:11.109 --> 04:17:11.119 align:start position:0%
yes representative Cornell Thank you
 
04:17:13.349 --> 04:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um it
 
04:17:14.750 --> 04:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
sounds like what you're talking about
 
04:17:17.349 --> 04:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
are places that that vote directly on
 
04:17:20.510 --> 04:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
school budgets by the constituents what
 
04:17:22.189 --> 04:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
happens in a place like Manchester
 
04:17:25.309 --> 04:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
that's giving a School District budget
 
04:17:26.750 --> 04:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that's that
 
04:17:29.349 --> 04:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
is a very good question um I would Point
 
04:17:31.910 --> 04:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
your local board school committee back
 
04:17:33.590 --> 04:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
to their general counsel in terms of how
 
04:17:35.030 --> 04:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
they would account for monies that needs
 
04:17:36.550 --> 04:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
to be switched around or something to
 
04:17:39.670 --> 04:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
that effect um that wouldn't already be
 
04:17:41.550 --> 04:17:41.560 align:start position:0%
subject to some sort of public meeting
 
04:17:43.109 --> 04:17:43.119 align:start position:0%
or some other way to account for where
 
04:17:45.030 --> 04:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
that money is going um there are
 
04:17:46.830 --> 04:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
procedures for that in both cities and
 
04:17:48.830 --> 04:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
in towns that are on the local vote so
 
04:17:52.510 --> 04:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I'm not again I no
 
04:17:54.149 --> 04:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
disrespect to the sponsors of this bill
 
04:17:55.830 --> 04:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the pro what problem
 
04:17:57.269 --> 04:17:57.279 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to address or what
 
04:17:58.830 --> 04:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
the concern is that was brought forth in
 
04:18:01.429 --> 04:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
terms of money being unexpended for
 
04:18:04.309 --> 04:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
special ed or being taken from Special
 
04:18:08.389 --> 04:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
Ed and put somewhere else further
 
04:18:11.070 --> 04:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
04:18:15.670 --> 04:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh we have a card also from uh Jan Bon
 
04:18:30.189 --> 04:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:32.349 --> 04:18:32.359 align:start position:0%
Association good afternoon and thank you
 
04:18:34.510 --> 04:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to
 
04:18:36.830 --> 04:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
testify for the record my name is Jam
 
04:18:38.830 --> 04:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
Bon bullu and I'm the executive director
 
04:18:40.630 --> 04:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
for the special ed administrators
 
04:18:43.349 --> 04:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
Association and I won't repeat um any of
 
04:18:46.030 --> 04:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
the previous uh testimony that you heard
 
04:18:47.630 --> 04:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
but our association I'm here
 
04:18:49.109 --> 04:18:49.119 align:start position:0%
representing our association and we're
 
04:18:51.990 --> 04:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
in opposition of this bill um the basis
 
04:18:54.910 --> 04:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
of the OB objection is really that our
 
04:18:57.389 --> 04:18:57.399 align:start position:0%
members um can demonstrate and feel as
 
04:18:59.790 --> 04:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
though um within their school districts
 
04:19:02.189 --> 04:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
there are well- defined processes in
 
04:19:05.670 --> 04:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
place uh for um budgeting monitoring
 
04:19:08.710 --> 04:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
funds as well as Any Grant monies that
 
04:19:10.590 --> 04:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
come in it's very highly regulated and
 
04:19:13.630 --> 04:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
well documented um and felt as though
 
04:19:16.109 --> 04:19:16.119 align:start position:0%
that this bill wasn't necessary I think
 
04:19:18.309 --> 04:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
our biggest concern was that the bill
 
04:19:21.309 --> 04:19:21.319 align:start position:0%
you know refers to um only using special
 
04:19:24.469 --> 04:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
education money uh for special education
 
04:19:27.229 --> 04:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
situations and as we spoke um earlier
 
04:19:30.469 --> 04:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
today um most of our special ed students
 
04:19:33.550 --> 04:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
are in the general education setting and
 
04:19:35.550 --> 04:19:35.560 align:start position:0%
our members felt as though this bill
 
04:19:37.790 --> 04:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
could really po potentially negatively
 
04:19:42.109 --> 04:19:42.119 align:start position:0%
impact inclusionary practices um idea
 
04:19:45.070 --> 04:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
allows for preventative uh interventions
 
04:19:47.469 --> 04:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
in the General Ed setting um which is
 
04:19:49.229 --> 04:19:49.239 align:start position:0%
where many of those kinds of
 
04:19:51.710 --> 04:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
interventions happen and they often
 
04:19:53.830 --> 04:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
include general education students so
 
04:19:56.070 --> 04:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
for example if a speech and language
 
04:19:59.109 --> 04:19:59.119 align:start position:0%
pathologist is working um on language
 
04:20:02.550 --> 04:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
skills with um a student um who might
 
04:20:04.670 --> 04:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
have an IEP they could be in a small
 
04:20:06.830 --> 04:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
group setting with General ed students
 
04:20:09.590 --> 04:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
and so the monies are used um for that
 
04:20:11.389 --> 04:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
speech pathologist to pay for the
 
04:20:14.229 --> 04:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
implementation of the IEP but typical
 
04:20:16.910 --> 04:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
students are engaged in the small group
 
04:20:18.870 --> 04:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
and have to be so that the student can
 
04:20:21.309 --> 04:20:21.319 align:start position:0%
socialize and use their language
 
04:20:24.070 --> 04:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
skills um in addition to that you know
 
04:20:26.830 --> 04:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
some other examples are many of our
 
04:20:28.590 --> 04:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
school districts are using specialized
 
04:20:30.830 --> 04:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
literacy programs such as Orton
 
04:20:33.870 --> 04:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
Gillingham just an example um oftentimes
 
04:20:35.950 --> 04:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
that's used and paid for through special
 
04:20:39.510 --> 04:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
ed money but is used for um all kids um
 
04:20:40.990 --> 04:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
if there are interventions out there
 
04:20:43.030 --> 04:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
that work um we might as well use them
 
04:20:45.950 --> 04:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
for all students we also talked in our
 
04:20:48.229 --> 04:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
association a lot about um response to
 
04:20:50.189 --> 04:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
interventions and multi-tiered systems
 
04:20:52.109 --> 04:20:52.119 align:start position:0%
of support which are being highly
 
04:20:53.950 --> 04:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
encouraged and supported in all of our
 
04:20:56.870 --> 04:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
public schools and these are um you know
 
04:20:59.550 --> 04:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
layers of interventions um and they are
 
04:21:02.429 --> 04:21:02.439 align:start position:0%
intended to be for all kids including um
 
04:21:04.469 --> 04:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
our most needy who might be in the top
 
04:21:06.950 --> 04:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
tier um but within that top tier here
 
04:21:08.790 --> 04:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
you know special ed might be funding a
 
04:21:10.309 --> 04:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
lot of those interventions but there
 
04:21:13.550 --> 04:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
would be General Ed kids also engaged in
 
04:21:13.560 --> 04:21:14.429 align:start position:0%
would be General Ed kids also engaged in
those

04:21:14.429 --> 04:21:14.439 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:21:17.309 --> 04:21:17.319 align:start position:0%
opportunities so in conclusion we felt
 
04:21:19.830 --> 04:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
as though that the bill as written um
 
04:21:22.149 --> 04:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
really could have some negative impacts
 
04:21:25.790 --> 04:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
Upon Our um entire school systems as it
 
04:21:28.030 --> 04:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
relates to both General and special
 
04:21:30.469 --> 04:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
education students and hope that you
 
04:21:32.910 --> 04:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
would consider this testimony thank you
 
04:21:34.950 --> 04:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
very much thank you very much uh
 
04:21:37.710 --> 04:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
representative dry thank you Mr chairman
 
04:21:40.189 --> 04:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I I
 
04:21:42.469 --> 04:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
like your example of using a mixed group
 
04:21:47.349 --> 04:21:47.359 align:start position:0%
of students for um uh a process uh but I
 
04:21:49.670 --> 04:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
I think the intent would be special
 
04:21:52.149 --> 04:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
education I mean it's not like this is a
 
04:21:54.189 --> 04:21:54.199 align:start position:0%
special education person joining a
 
04:21:55.950 --> 04:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
different group it would be used to for
 
04:21:58.429 --> 04:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
the special education process so I don't
 
04:22:01.630 --> 04:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
see exactly how that would be not uh it
 
04:22:03.750 --> 04:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
would be money that was not spent on
 
04:22:03.760 --> 04:22:04.830 align:start position:0%
would be money that was not spent on
special

04:22:04.830 --> 04:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
special
 
04:22:06.870 --> 04:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
education well I guess that's the the
 
04:22:09.550 --> 04:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
lack of clarity within the bill itself
 
04:22:12.710 --> 04:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know it it's speaks of um
 
04:22:15.030 --> 04:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the use of special education
 
04:22:17.469 --> 04:22:17.479 align:start position:0%
monies for anything other than special
 
04:22:19.750 --> 04:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
education um and so that's an example
 
04:22:21.830 --> 04:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
where it's not just special education
 
04:22:25.269 --> 04:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
and it happens often so if you use you
 
04:22:27.389 --> 04:22:27.399 align:start position:0%
know the example of multi-tiered systems
 
04:22:30.870 --> 04:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
of support the first tier is uh making
 
04:22:33.670 --> 04:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
sure that all kids have access to
 
04:22:35.870 --> 04:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
interventions and it could be that in
 
04:22:38.109 --> 04:22:38.119 align:start position:0%
tier one one we've got several kids with
 
04:22:39.830 --> 04:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
disabilities who need a specific
 
04:22:41.870 --> 04:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
intervention and you've got a teacher in
 
04:22:43.670 --> 04:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
there and you've got three kids if you
 
04:22:46.830 --> 04:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
can take for General Ed kids at the same
 
04:22:49.149 --> 04:22:49.159 align:start position:0%
time and they all work together and can
 
04:22:52.109 --> 04:22:52.119 align:start position:0%
benefit it's coste effective and it's
 
04:22:54.070 --> 04:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
the most beneficial thing for the child
 
04:22:56.750 --> 04:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
so you're you're using some of that
 
04:23:00.309 --> 04:23:00.319 align:start position:0%
money for General Ed and special ed does
 
04:23:03.830 --> 04:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
that helped to clarify follow yes a
 
04:23:06.750 --> 04:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
little bit but I I think my just in my
 
04:23:09.830 --> 04:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
mind it would it would be adding to a
 
04:23:12.750 --> 04:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
special education process not taking it
 
04:23:15.349 --> 04:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
as a a non specialed process and adding
 
04:23:17.429 --> 04:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
special ed to it um I think I'm looking
 
04:23:20.910 --> 04:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
at it that direction um can you help me
 
04:23:23.790 --> 04:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
sure so it would be spe um probably um
 
04:23:26.109 --> 04:23:26.119 align:start position:0%
budgeted in the special ed budget for
 
04:23:28.309 --> 04:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
those intervention and that
 
04:23:30.510 --> 04:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
interventionist um so you know it
 
04:23:32.309 --> 04:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
they're not just
 
04:23:35.710 --> 04:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
limiting it to special ed kits and and
 
04:23:37.670 --> 04:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
we felt as though as this bill was
 
04:23:40.269 --> 04:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
written these fund it was stating that
 
04:23:42.670 --> 04:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
special ed money should go just to
 
04:23:42.680 --> 04:23:43.870 align:start position:0%
special ed money should go just to
special

04:23:43.870 --> 04:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
special
 
04:23:47.870 --> 04:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
education thank you are there further
 
04:23:50.670 --> 04:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
04:23:52.590 --> 04:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:23:55.109 --> 04:23:55.119 align:start position:0%
for that enlightening testimony um we
 
04:23:58.429 --> 04:23:58.439 align:start position:0%
often hear in this committee that we are
 
04:24:00.269 --> 04:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
not adequately funding special education
 
04:24:01.870 --> 04:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
there's not enough money for what needs
 
04:24:04.790 --> 04:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
to be done um I just want to clarify
 
04:24:06.670 --> 04:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
that your testimony is that we're
 
04:24:08.510 --> 04:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
actually expending special education
 
04:24:11.469 --> 04:24:11.479 align:start position:0%
funds on special education services that
 
04:24:14.670 --> 04:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
are being applied generally and not just
 
04:24:17.189 --> 04:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
to special education students they're
 
04:24:19.349 --> 04:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
being applied to special education
 
04:24:21.990 --> 04:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
students and if there's an opportunity
 
04:24:25.109 --> 04:24:25.119 align:start position:0%
to bring in kids other kids typical kids
 
04:24:27.269 --> 04:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
that would benefit it's not going to
 
04:24:30.229 --> 04:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
cost anymore I mean why do it for two
 
04:24:31.910 --> 04:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
kids when you might be able to do it for
 
04:24:36.590 --> 04:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
five and hopefully um that would would
 
04:24:39.630 --> 04:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
you know delay or not delay but not
 
04:24:41.429 --> 04:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
cause a student to be referred to
 
04:24:43.630 --> 04:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
special education so if they can get you
 
04:24:45.109 --> 04:24:45.119 align:start position:0%
know have advantage of those
 
04:24:47.630 --> 04:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
interventions um why not provide it to
 
04:24:49.870 --> 04:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
all does that
 
04:24:52.229 --> 04:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
help it does and if I may just just to
 
04:24:54.030 --> 04:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
clarify then so there there are no
 
04:24:55.750 --> 04:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances occurring where special
 
04:24:58.070 --> 04:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
education funds are being expended for
 
04:24:59.910 --> 04:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
special education services without
 
04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
regard for the special education service
 
04:25:05.109 --> 04:25:05.119 align:start position:0%
or the the special education child being
 
04:25:06.910 --> 04:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
present or not so there's no just
 
04:25:08.630 --> 04:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
blanket administration of these kind of
 
04:25:10.790 --> 04:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
services without at least knowing that
 
04:25:12.349 --> 04:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
there is a special education child
 
04:25:13.990 --> 04:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
present who's benefiting from this
 
04:25:16.429 --> 04:25:16.439 align:start position:0%
service I would say no that's not the
 
04:25:21.710 --> 04:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:24.830 --> 04:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
all you look like you're questioning S I
 
04:25:26.630 --> 04:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
I I think I may have reversed that that
 
04:25:28.389 --> 04:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
question answer so okay why don't you
 
04:25:31.870 --> 04:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
pursue it just thank you just the
 
04:25:33.590 --> 04:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
so there
 
04:25:37.070 --> 04:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
are are there ever occasions happening
 
04:25:39.469 --> 04:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
where we are spending special education
 
04:25:41.550 --> 04:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
funds and utilizing special education
 
04:25:44.109 --> 04:25:44.119 align:start position:0%
services wherein there may not be a
 
04:25:45.870 --> 04:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
special education child present
 
04:25:48.389 --> 04:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
receiving them no typically if the the
 
04:25:51.030 --> 04:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
special education student is not there
 
04:25:54.309 --> 04:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
the um special educator would go on to
 
04:25:57.349 --> 04:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
the next kids on her case list and
 
04:26:00.030 --> 04:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
adjust her scheduled um that kind of
 
04:26:01.229 --> 04:26:01.239 align:start position:0%
thing thank
 
04:26:04.790 --> 04:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
you are the further questions
 
04:26:08.109 --> 04:26:08.119 align:start position:0%
for uh special uh Association not see it
 
04:26:10.109 --> 04:26:10.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank
 
04:26:13.269 --> 04:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
you are there any other cards for this
 
04:26:16.389 --> 04:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
particular Bill to
 
04:26:20.030 --> 04:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
coming okay bring it up no no just hand
 
04:26:20.040 --> 04:26:31.070 align:start position:0%
coming okay bring it up no no just hand
it

04:26:31.070 --> 04:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:36.149 --> 04:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
there thank you Miss Ryan welcome back
 
04:26:38.229 --> 04:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I just directly need to rebut
 
04:26:40.990 --> 04:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
that because my school district paid for
 
04:26:42.710 --> 04:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
services for my son that he did not
 
04:26:45.790 --> 04:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
receive for the entire 20122 2023 school
 
04:26:48.229 --> 04:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
year so they were paying for services
 
04:26:50.349 --> 04:26:50.359 align:start position:0%
that he did not get so there are
 
04:26:52.109 --> 04:26:52.119 align:start position:0%
services or funds that are expended that
 
04:26:55.870 --> 04:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:59.670 --> 04:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:02.990 --> 04:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
04:27:09.229 --> 04:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:12.870 --> 04:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:15.910 --> 04:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
go okay
 
04:27:15.920 --> 04:27:18.990 align:start position:0%
go okay
Kristen

04:27:18.990 --> 04:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:21.429 --> 04:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
maner R
 
04:27:24.389 --> 04:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
Ramy yeah it is a test you know I'll do
 
04:27:27.630 --> 04:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
it Kristen mon sharani uh special
 
04:27:30.229 --> 04:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
education advocate here in New Hampshire
 
04:27:32.790 --> 04:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh I was not planning to testify on
 
04:27:34.550 --> 04:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
this one but I just want to respond a
 
04:27:36.670 --> 04:27:36.680 align:start position:0%
bit because I am concerned about the
 
04:27:39.630 --> 04:27:39.640 align:start position:0%
interplay between the
 
04:27:41.750 --> 04:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
finance um investigative committee
 
04:27:43.229 --> 04:27:43.239 align:start position:0%
that's being set up with regard to
 
04:27:44.630 --> 04:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
special education
 
04:27:47.870 --> 04:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
dollars and this implication that um
 
04:27:49.830 --> 04:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
some of these special education dollars
 
04:27:53.750 --> 04:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
are going towards general education um I
 
04:27:57.189 --> 04:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
think that it is important to delineate
 
04:28:00.030 --> 04:28:00.040 align:start position:0%
special education dollars and to to
 
04:28:02.109 --> 04:28:02.119 align:start position:0%
Really confine those to use in special
 
04:28:05.269 --> 04:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
education and I do not think in any way
 
04:28:06.990 --> 04:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
that it Prov vent some of the beneficial
 
04:28:10.030 --> 04:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
situations that Miss Bon buo was just
 
04:28:12.030 --> 04:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
discussing yes there are as I said
 
04:28:14.030 --> 04:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
before there are sometimes very small
 
04:28:15.990 --> 04:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
groups in which services are delivered
 
04:28:18.590 --> 04:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
to a child receiving special education
 
04:28:20.630 --> 04:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
paired with some other children in the
 
04:28:22.109 --> 04:28:22.119 align:start position:0%
general education curriculum and those
 
04:28:24.950 --> 04:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
benefit that special education child but
 
04:28:27.309 --> 04:28:27.319 align:start position:0%
it would that that service would still
 
04:28:29.990 --> 04:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
be in the service delivery grid of the
 
04:28:31.990 --> 04:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
individualized education program for
 
04:28:34.349 --> 04:28:34.359 align:start position:0%
that special education child so the
 
04:28:36.790 --> 04:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
funding you know if a provider an
 
04:28:38.670 --> 04:28:38.680 align:start position:0%
occupational therapist is working with
 
04:28:42.389 --> 04:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
three children two of whom have IEPs one
 
04:28:45.550 --> 04:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
of whom doesn't that funding is still a
 
04:28:46.870 --> 04:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
I I don't think there's any question
 
04:28:48.630 --> 04:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
about whether that is special education
 
04:28:51.510 --> 04:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
funding because that person's time is
 
04:28:53.790 --> 04:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
delineated in an IEP Service delivery
 
04:28:58.229 --> 04:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
grid for that child so I I the other
 
04:28:59.670 --> 04:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
point that we're talking about is this
 
04:29:03.990 --> 04:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
multi-tiered system of support and that
 
04:29:06.750 --> 04:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
I think is a concern that you know we
 
04:29:08.469 --> 04:29:08.479 align:start position:0%
need to dive further into because it is
 
04:29:11.469 --> 04:29:11.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely true that sometimes and this
 
04:29:13.990 --> 04:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
came up a bit earlier we're seeing
 
04:29:17.229 --> 04:29:17.239 align:start position:0%
referrals to special education
 
04:29:19.990 --> 04:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
because multi-tiered systems of support
 
04:29:22.109 --> 04:29:22.119 align:start position:0%
at at sort of a tier one level that that
 
04:29:23.550 --> 04:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
you know the first interventions we
 
04:29:26.750 --> 04:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
should be doing do need to be given more
 
04:29:29.429 --> 04:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
broadly to you know 30% of the students
 
04:29:31.309 --> 04:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
in the general education population and
 
04:29:32.870 --> 04:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
those students shouldn't all be referred
 
04:29:33.870 --> 04:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
to Special
 
04:29:36.309 --> 04:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
Ed I personally have encountered a
 
04:29:38.750 --> 04:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
number of districts where there seem to
 
04:29:42.990 --> 04:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
be as we dug in to cases and disputes no
 
04:29:45.910 --> 04:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
mechanism for children to have received
 
04:29:48.590 --> 04:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
intervention services in the general
 
04:29:48.600 --> 04:29:50.229 align:start position:0%
intervention services in the general
education

04:29:50.229 --> 04:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:29:52.910 --> 04:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
context therefore we're in disputes
 
04:29:54.510 --> 04:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
about their eligibility for special
 
04:29:55.790 --> 04:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
education because the student is
 
04:29:58.189 --> 04:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
certainly falling further and further
 
04:30:01.790 --> 04:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
behind and so again especially when
 
04:30:03.070 --> 04:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
there's a committee that's being
 
04:30:05.189 --> 04:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
designated for looking at special
 
04:30:08.229 --> 04:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
education Finance dollars I think we
 
04:30:10.109 --> 04:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
have to keep very separate these systems
 
04:30:13.870 --> 04:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
so yes multi-tiered systems of support
 
04:30:17.469 --> 04:30:17.479 align:start position:0%
on the first levels benefit everyone but
 
04:30:19.269 --> 04:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't want to see those starting to
 
04:30:21.990 --> 04:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
be lumped into special education dollars
 
04:30:22.710 --> 04:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
because you're going to have the
 
04:30:24.389 --> 04:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
concerns raised that we're spending so
 
04:30:26.990 --> 04:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
much on special education when in fact
 
04:30:28.389 --> 04:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
those are actually dollars being spent
 
04:30:30.710 --> 04:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
in the general education classrooms that
 
04:30:33.070 --> 04:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
should be there that might prevent more
 
04:30:35.149 --> 04:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
special education referrals later on but
 
04:30:36.950 --> 04:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
they're not the same pools of money and
 
04:30:38.630 --> 04:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
they they really shouldn't be we we need
 
04:30:40.030 --> 04:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
to distinguish those because we need to
 
04:30:42.630 --> 04:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
start looking at what multi-tiered
 
04:30:45.309 --> 04:30:45.319 align:start position:0%
systems of support for those general
 
04:30:47.189 --> 04:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
education students who may not need to
 
04:30:49.710 --> 04:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
get to special education referrals exist
 
04:30:51.149 --> 04:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
or don't
 
04:30:53.510 --> 04:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
exist and this is in mental health as
 
04:30:54.990 --> 04:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
well because there's also a multitude
 
04:30:57.109 --> 04:30:57.119 align:start position:0%
system of supports there and then where
 
04:30:59.109 --> 04:30:59.119 align:start position:0%
it really should be special education
 
04:31:03.670 --> 04:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
and and I think to be um clear when
 
04:31:05.309 --> 04:31:05.319 align:start position:0%
we're looking at pools of money they
 
04:31:07.269 --> 04:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
they ways to really delineate those and
 
04:31:08.750 --> 04:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
they should be delineated and the fact
 
04:31:11.349 --> 04:31:11.359 align:start position:0%
that some special education services
 
04:31:12.590 --> 04:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
will be
 
04:31:14.469 --> 04:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
delivered paired with some general
 
04:31:16.229 --> 04:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
education students wouldn't make those
 
04:31:17.870 --> 04:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
non-sp special education dollars but I
 
04:31:19.070 --> 04:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to see it going the other
 
04:31:21.990 --> 04:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
way we we have to make sure that dollars
 
04:31:24.990 --> 04:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
designated as special
 
04:31:27.030 --> 04:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
education because there are a lot of
 
04:31:29.189 --> 04:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
concerns about the level of spending in
 
04:31:30.830 --> 04:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
special education we have to make sure
 
04:31:33.670 --> 04:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
those dollars are not substituting in
 
04:31:36.109 --> 04:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
even with the best of intentions from
 
04:31:37.630 --> 04:31:37.640 align:start position:0%
your school administrators because they
 
04:31:39.229 --> 04:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
might really have the best of intentions
 
04:31:40.990 --> 04:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
look we need more supports provided in
 
04:31:43.269 --> 04:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
some of our general Ed populations we
 
04:31:44.790 --> 04:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
need more reading Specialists we need
 
04:31:46.950 --> 04:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
math Specialists but those aren't
 
04:31:48.510 --> 04:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
genuinely special education dollars and
 
04:31:50.349 --> 04:31:50.359 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't want to see that get
 
04:31:51.630 --> 04:31:51.640 align:start position:0%
comingled and
 
04:31:54.269 --> 04:31:54.279 align:start position:0%
Confused thank you are there any
 
04:31:56.510 --> 04:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative Pell thank you
 
04:31:58.030 --> 04:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:32:02.429 --> 04:32:02.439 align:start position:0%
question so as I read this obviously at
 
04:32:05.830 --> 04:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
first glance it looks like this school
 
04:32:07.550 --> 04:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
district has to be held accountable for
 
04:32:09.510 --> 04:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
the money that they have spent but on
 
04:32:12.030 --> 04:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
the other side of it on the revenue side
 
04:32:14.349 --> 04:32:14.359 align:start position:0%
I see this as a way of making sure that
 
04:32:16.710 --> 04:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
the School receives the revenue that
 
04:32:19.070 --> 04:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
they need for the specialed students
 
04:32:21.510 --> 04:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
would do you think that that could
 
04:32:23.030 --> 04:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
possibly be a benefit of this
 
04:32:26.189 --> 04:32:26.199 align:start position:0%
legislation or something similar yes I
 
04:32:29.630 --> 04:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
do further questions from the committee
 
04:32:31.189 --> 04:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
not seeing it thank you very much we're
 
04:32:33.750 --> 04:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
going to close this
 
04:32:40.189 --> 04:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:43.030 --> 04:32:43.040 align:start position:0%

to introduce not on it what I know but
 
04:32:59.229 --> 04:32:59.239 align:start position:0%

uh thank you for the opportunity to
 
04:34:27.670 --> 04:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
speak with you today I am the
 
04:34:29.109 --> 04:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
administrator for the office of dispute
 
04:34:30.709 --> 04:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
resolution of constituent complaints for
 
04:34:33.109 --> 04:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education uh part of
 
04:34:35.310 --> 04:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
my role includes administering the
 
04:34:37.349 --> 04:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolution processes
 
04:34:40.910 --> 04:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Education RSA 186
 
04:34:43.551 --> 04:34:43.561 align:start position:0%
c23 pertains in general terms to
 
04:34:45.709 --> 04:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
Alternative dispute
 
04:34:48.949 --> 04:34:48.959 align:start position:0%
resolution these are various processes
 
04:34:51.150 --> 04:34:51.160 align:start position:0%
in which an impartial thirdparty assists
 
04:34:53.029 --> 04:34:53.039 align:start position:0%
parents and school districts to resolve
 
04:34:55.189 --> 04:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
a ver uh a
 
04:34:57.869 --> 04:34:57.879 align:start position:0%
conflict one of these processes is
 
04:35:02.590 --> 04:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
neutral conference which is in RSA 186c
 
04:35:04.949 --> 04:35:04.959 align:start position:0%
23-b that is the statute that is being
 
04:35:07.109 --> 04:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
amended in House Bill
 
04:35:09.510 --> 04:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
1443 I want to bring your attention to
 
04:35:13.551 --> 04:35:13.561 align:start position:0%
lines 6 and seven on page one select a
 
04:35:16.670 --> 04:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
neutral on a rotational basis this
 
04:35:18.510 --> 04:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
requested change reflects the fact that
 
04:35:20.070 --> 04:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
the department currently has four
 
04:35:21.830 --> 04:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
individuals who conduct all of the
 
04:35:24.189 --> 04:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
Department's administrative processes
 
04:35:26.429 --> 04:35:26.439 align:start position:0%
and allows for scheduling flexibility to
 
04:35:29.150 --> 04:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
ensure coverage for all
 
04:35:31.869 --> 04:35:31.879 align:start position:0%
processes we also ask for a change to
 
04:35:35.750 --> 04:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
RSA 186 c24 to enable media mediators to
 
04:35:37.990 --> 04:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
be assigned on a rotational instead of
 
04:35:39.910 --> 04:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
regional basis as well for the same
 
04:35:43.670 --> 04:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
reasons this change codifies NH Ed's
 
04:35:43.680 --> 04:35:44.830 align:start position:0%
reasons this change codifies NH Ed's
current

04:35:44.830 --> 04:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
current
 
04:35:47.189 --> 04:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
practice I next bring your attention to
 
04:35:51.029 --> 04:35:51.039 align:start position:0%
line 23 is there any questions um line
 
04:35:53.590 --> 04:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
six any
 
04:35:56.269 --> 04:35:56.279 align:start position:0%
concerns um just just go have you done
 
04:36:00.470 --> 04:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
all your testimony no I'm no let's let's
 
04:36:01.789 --> 04:36:01.799 align:start position:0%
hear all the whole testimony and then
 
04:36:03.070 --> 04:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
we'll follow up with questions at the
 
04:36:05.429 --> 04:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
end that's fine thank you thank thank
 
04:36:08.709 --> 04:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
you uh here the requested changes is to
 
04:36:10.990 --> 04:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
add in the phrase unless Changed by
 
04:36:13.830 --> 04:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
agreement of the parties provides more
 
04:36:16.910 --> 04:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility to the parties and want to
 
04:36:18.990 --> 04:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the time
 
04:36:21.230 --> 04:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
constraint lastly I draw your attention
 
04:36:25.150 --> 04:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
to lines 26 uh through 30 page 1 and
 
04:36:28.830 --> 04:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
lines 1-2 on page two this addition
 
04:36:30.750 --> 04:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
provides clear guidance as to what the
 
04:36:33.470 --> 04:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
role of the neutral is to be the reason
 
04:36:35.750 --> 04:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
we are asking this to be in the law is
 
04:36:37.189 --> 04:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
because the role of the neutral is
 
04:36:38.949 --> 04:36:38.959 align:start position:0%
changing to provide the neutral with
 
04:36:40.910 --> 04:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
more opportunity for interaction with
 
04:36:42.910 --> 04:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
the parties currently neutral
 
04:36:45.629 --> 04:36:45.639 align:start position:0%
conferences are more like a mini hearing
 
04:36:47.869 --> 04:36:47.879 align:start position:0%
and as such may be part of the overall
 
04:36:50.590 --> 04:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
reason why they have not been regularly
 
04:36:52.990 --> 04:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
utilized the language was taken from
 
04:36:55.070 --> 04:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
elements of the now discontinued third
 
04:36:57.390 --> 04:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
party led by Mo moderator at one point
 
04:36:59.349 --> 04:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
we had three different alternative
 
04:37:01.230 --> 04:37:01.240 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution processes and we've
 
04:37:04.310 --> 04:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
eliminated one the added language
 
04:37:06.269 --> 04:37:06.279 align:start position:0%
provides for more proactive discussion
 
04:37:08.390 --> 04:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
between the parties and the neutral
 
04:37:10.670 --> 04:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
similar in some respects to mediation
 
04:37:12.670 --> 04:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
but unlike mediation with the ultimate
 
04:37:16.070 --> 04:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
aim of the neutral offering the parties
 
04:37:19.510 --> 04:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
an opinion which can be adopted by the
 
04:37:23.269 --> 04:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
parties a mediator cannot off offer an
 
04:37:26.349 --> 04:37:26.359 align:start position:0%
opinion it's especially useful and was
 
04:37:27.990 --> 04:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
something that had been requested by
 
04:37:29.869 --> 04:37:29.879 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to have the neutral to be
 
04:37:32.789 --> 04:37:32.799 align:start position:0%
able to offer an verbal opinion as to
 
04:37:35.150 --> 04:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
whether the remedy remedy a party seeks
 
04:37:37.429 --> 04:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
is allowed under the
 
04:37:40.269 --> 04:37:40.279 align:start position:0%
law with such a verbal opinion it may
 
04:37:43.510 --> 04:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
help to refocus the issue the changes to
 
04:37:45.109 --> 04:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
allow for the neutral to provide
 
04:37:47.150 --> 04:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
insights as to how a hearing officer May
 
04:37:49.269 --> 04:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
view the particular matter can also help
 
04:37:52.990 --> 04:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
to open dialogue between the parties
 
04:37:54.670 --> 04:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
it's felt that if these changes are made
 
04:37:57.349 --> 04:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
to the current law it will provide the
 
04:37:59.230 --> 04:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
parties with a much more userfriendly
 
04:38:02.310 --> 04:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
alternative to a due process hearing or
 
04:38:02.320 --> 04:38:03.910 align:start position:0%
alternative to a due process hearing or
regular

04:38:03.910 --> 04:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
regular
 
04:38:03.920 --> 04:38:06.109 align:start position:0%
regular
mediation

04:38:06.109 --> 04:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
mediation
 
04:38:08.150 --> 04:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you if there are any
 
04:38:09.990 --> 04:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions yes
 
04:38:13.310 --> 04:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
representative uh Pete thank you stepen
 
04:38:19.429 --> 04:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:21.830 --> 04:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
um um I'm just playing the role of a
 
04:38:24.510 --> 04:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
potted represent so I
 
04:38:26.830 --> 04:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
understand Stephen could you walk us
 
04:38:29.070 --> 04:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
through the whole process um you know
 
04:38:30.551 --> 04:38:30.561 align:start position:0%
it's been a long long time since I
 
04:38:32.869 --> 04:38:32.879 align:start position:0%
worked at the department and and how
 
04:38:34.590 --> 04:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
does a complaint come to you then what
 
04:38:36.910 --> 04:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
happens next and and how do we get to
 
04:38:39.830 --> 04:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
the dispute resolution so in terms of
 
04:38:41.629 --> 04:38:41.639 align:start position:0%
neutral conference what happens is if
 
04:38:43.789 --> 04:38:43.799 align:start position:0%
the parties uh decide that they don't
 
04:38:45.349 --> 04:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
want to go through a due process hearing
 
04:38:47.189 --> 04:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
or even if they do but they select to
 
04:38:49.670 --> 04:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
use neutral conference then the school
 
04:38:52.750 --> 04:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
district will submit the paperwork uh
 
04:38:54.830 --> 04:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
request for neutral conference in this
 
04:38:58.590 --> 04:38:58.600 align:start position:0%
instance a uh agreement to neutral
 
04:39:01.109 --> 04:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
conference and also we require the
 
04:39:03.310 --> 04:39:03.320 align:start position:0%
school districts could be considered ad
 
04:39:06.230 --> 04:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
hoc I suppose uh commitment of resources
 
04:39:07.670 --> 04:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
of the school district and the reason
 
04:39:09.349 --> 04:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
why we do that is a protection for
 
04:39:10.949 --> 04:39:10.959 align:start position:0%
parents because if something is agreed
 
04:39:13.029 --> 04:39:13.039 align:start position:0%
to in a neutral conference I think I've
 
04:39:17.310 --> 04:39:17.320 align:start position:0%
told you this years ago then um we don't
 
04:39:19.390 --> 04:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
want the school district to you know
 
04:39:20.750 --> 04:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
officials to go back to the school
 
04:39:22.470 --> 04:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
district and say well the superintendent
 
04:39:24.390 --> 04:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't agree to this well we have your
 
04:39:26.470 --> 04:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
signature and it says you will agree to
 
04:39:28.869 --> 04:39:28.879 align:start position:0%
whatever is agreed to when the parties
 
04:39:31.150 --> 04:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
are in the room together and so that's
 
04:39:33.269 --> 04:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
how it comes to us and what happens is
 
04:39:35.029 --> 04:39:35.039 align:start position:0%
that uh if the parties have have
 
04:39:36.709 --> 04:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
specific dates that they would like to
 
04:39:39.070 --> 04:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
do a proceeding we try to utilize those
 
04:39:41.830 --> 04:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
dates uh and rotationally with who is
 
04:39:43.868 --> 04:39:43.878 align:start position:0%
available because we have a lot of
 
04:39:46.708 --> 04:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
processes and then uh we schedule it and
 
04:39:49.070 --> 04:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
the neutral uh will meet with the
 
04:39:53.550 --> 04:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
parties uh and um currently they would
 
04:39:55.868 --> 04:39:55.878 align:start position:0%
each side would get a half an hour they
 
04:39:59.788 --> 04:39:59.798 align:start position:0%
have um four up to four pages of
 
04:40:02.030 --> 04:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
documents that they can provide prior to
 
04:40:04.910 --> 04:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
5 days I think it is prior to and then
 
04:40:08.670 --> 04:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
at the um at the conclusion the neutral
 
04:40:11.190 --> 04:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
can render a decision and the parties
 
04:40:13.750 --> 04:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
can adopt it or decide not to so that's
 
04:40:15.550 --> 04:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
the current and that's what we're trying
 
04:40:19.670 --> 04:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
to change y thank you further questions
 
04:40:22.190 --> 04:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
from the committe representative Damon
 
04:40:23.830 --> 04:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for helping
 
04:40:25.990 --> 04:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
us understand this could you tell us
 
04:40:28.628 --> 04:40:28.638 align:start position:0%
what the qualifications of a neutral are
 
04:40:30.628 --> 04:40:30.638 align:start position:0%
so all of our neutrals are currently
 
04:40:32.628 --> 04:40:32.638 align:start position:0%
attorneys they're all admitted to the
 
04:40:34.910 --> 04:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
bar in New Hampshire uh and they all
 
04:40:36.590 --> 04:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
have education
 
04:40:40.750 --> 04:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
background yes follow y they have
 
04:40:42.190 --> 04:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
special education
 
04:40:45.830 --> 04:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
background well uh two of the so the
 
04:40:48.030 --> 04:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
answer is probably going to be yes I I
 
04:40:49.350 --> 04:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
don't know that because I don't have it
 
04:40:50.270 --> 04:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
in front of me I don't have their
 
04:40:53.990 --> 04:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
resumés but they've been doing um one
 
04:40:56.270 --> 04:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
current one James Baron had been a
 
04:40:59.350 --> 04:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
parent attorney and represented parent
 
04:41:01.628 --> 04:41:01.638 align:start position:0%
uh parents in special education cases in
 
04:41:04.070 --> 04:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts as well as New Hampshire
 
04:41:08.070 --> 04:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh Scott Johnson is also um well
 
04:41:09.750 --> 04:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
acquainted with special ed law he's been
 
04:41:11.628 --> 04:41:11.638 align:start position:0%
an attorney for years represented
 
04:41:16.390 --> 04:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
parents uh and um let's see they're
 
04:41:17.830 --> 04:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
going to be upset if I remember that uh
 
04:41:19.750 --> 04:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
Brianna kley had been a parent attorney
 
04:41:21.868 --> 04:41:21.878 align:start position:0%
who would also represented uh parents
 
04:41:24.030 --> 04:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
and Special Education cases on the SE
 
04:41:26.550 --> 04:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
Coast Area previously and Peter Foley
 
04:41:28.948 --> 04:41:28.958 align:start position:0%
had been a former attorney uh Assistant
 
04:41:31.910 --> 04:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
Attorney General and had been he doesn't
 
04:41:33.830 --> 04:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
do special education due process
 
04:41:35.230 --> 04:41:35.240 align:start position:0%
hearings very much
 
04:41:37.230 --> 04:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
but he does special ed and does
 
04:41:40.070 --> 04:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
mediations uh and also vocation
 
04:41:42.150 --> 04:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation so that's the background
 
04:41:43.750 --> 04:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
so I guess the answer to your question
 
04:41:43.760 --> 04:41:44.590 align:start position:0%
so I guess the answer to your question
is

04:41:44.590 --> 04:41:44.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:41:46.550 --> 04:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you further question
 
04:41:48.708 --> 04:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
representative Miler thank you Mr chair
 
04:41:51.430 --> 04:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here I'm a bit
 
04:41:55.910 --> 04:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
confused on the term option versus
 
04:41:59.150 --> 04:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
opinion can you can you I I one hand I
 
04:42:01.510 --> 04:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
hear I thought I I thought I heard you
 
04:42:04.788 --> 04:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
say that they provide options another
 
04:42:07.470 --> 04:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
time I heard you say they give opinions
 
04:42:09.628 --> 04:42:09.638 align:start position:0%
so could you please clarify that for me
 
04:42:13.948 --> 04:42:13.958 align:start position:0%
absolutely happy to do so so an option
 
04:42:16.390 --> 04:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
is what we're looking for in the change
 
04:42:18.990 --> 04:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
to the to the neutral conference because
 
04:42:21.750 --> 04:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
in this instance they would be acting as
 
04:42:24.670 --> 04:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
we we had a we had a a third procedure
 
04:42:26.708 --> 04:42:26.718 align:start position:0%
called third party discussion led by
 
04:42:29.110 --> 04:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
moderator and they would at the
 
04:42:32.750 --> 04:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
conclusion provide options so you not
 
04:42:35.350 --> 04:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
just a opinion
 
04:42:36.910 --> 04:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
but different options that you might
 
04:42:38.750 --> 04:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
want to think about in order to resolve
 
04:42:43.150 --> 04:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
the dispute and um so that's the
 
04:42:44.990 --> 04:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
difference one would be an opinion which
 
04:42:47.430 --> 04:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
is what the current neutral conf uh
 
04:42:50.030 --> 04:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
neutral conference would be and the
 
04:42:51.470 --> 04:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
parties could
 
04:42:54.948 --> 04:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
adapt um the or excuse me adopt the
 
04:42:57.230 --> 04:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
opinion and then it becomes binding on
 
04:42:57.240 --> 04:42:57.910 align:start position:0%
opinion and then it becomes binding on
the

04:42:57.910 --> 04:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:43:01.510 --> 04:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
parties uh or the in this instance the
 
04:43:04.270 --> 04:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
neutral could provide them with options
 
04:43:05.550 --> 04:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
in what we're
 
04:43:08.070 --> 04:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
asking so different options that they
 
04:43:09.830 --> 04:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
could think about and if they decide
 
04:43:12.110 --> 04:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
upon one then that can become an
 
04:43:13.788 --> 04:43:13.798 align:start position:0%
agreement between the parties and
 
04:43:16.990 --> 04:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
reduced to written form so followup
 
04:43:19.230 --> 04:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
please yes so you're you're basically
 
04:43:22.190 --> 04:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
trying to broaden correct the role of
 
04:43:25.030 --> 04:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
the individual to provide those those
 
04:43:29.310 --> 04:43:29.320 align:start position:0%
options correct it it goes back to so we
 
04:43:34.310 --> 04:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
were uh part of the part of the um audit
 
04:43:37.430 --> 04:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
and and we had had the third opportunity
 
04:43:39.430 --> 04:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
which was third party uh discussion led
 
04:43:42.070 --> 04:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
by moderator and we had utilized U
 
04:43:43.830 --> 04:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
advice from the Attorney General's
 
04:43:46.310 --> 04:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
office but the Auditors have determined
 
04:43:48.948 --> 04:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
that that's ad hoc and we can't do that
 
04:43:52.948 --> 04:43:52.958 align:start position:0%
unless we go through um this process you
 
04:43:57.390 --> 04:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
know to request um a law change and so
 
04:43:59.830 --> 04:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
we we realized that the neutral
 
04:44:01.750 --> 04:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
conferences weren't be they were being
 
04:44:04.150 --> 04:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
underutilized through the years and the
 
04:44:07.708 --> 04:44:07.718 align:start position:0%
number numers um are like for example
 
04:44:09.948 --> 04:44:09.958 align:start position:0%
1995 when the law was promulgated
 
04:44:12.390 --> 04:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
originally you had four requests and one
 
04:44:16.110 --> 04:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
agreement and 1996 we had one request
 
04:44:18.868 --> 04:44:18.878 align:start position:0%
and which was withdrawn so there was no
 
04:44:22.270 --> 04:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
agreement and to 1997 we had five
 
04:44:24.350 --> 04:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
requests and all were withdrawn so
 
04:44:25.868 --> 04:44:25.878 align:start position:0%
unfortunately neutral conferences
 
04:44:28.708 --> 04:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
weren't being utilized and more current
 
04:44:31.230 --> 04:44:31.240 align:start position:0%
uh we had um only seven neutral
 
04:44:34.430 --> 04:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
conferences with one agreement in 2018
 
04:44:37.868 --> 04:44:37.878 align:start position:0%
and one in 2021 so the thought is is
 
04:44:39.708 --> 04:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
that if we utilize the neutral
 
04:44:42.670 --> 04:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
conference that we have but change it a
 
04:44:44.708 --> 04:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
bit it can be more utilized because
 
04:44:47.390 --> 04:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
people were using the moderator session
 
04:44:49.470 --> 04:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
more um
 
04:44:52.470 --> 04:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to you know confuse and
 
04:44:55.990 --> 04:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
overstate everything but it was at there
 
04:44:59.270 --> 04:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
was a meeting uh with attorneys and
 
04:45:01.110 --> 04:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
Advocates back in
 
04:45:03.590 --> 04:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
1993 and they suggested that the
 
04:45:05.868 --> 04:45:05.878 align:start position:0%
department should have an alternative
 
04:45:08.270 --> 04:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
process where somebody could go and say
 
04:45:10.270 --> 04:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
what do you think of this case and so
 
04:45:11.910 --> 04:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's how moderator sessions had come
 
04:45:15.070 --> 04:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
about so we put
 
04:45:19.708 --> 04:45:19.718 align:start position:0%
our um our heads together and did a teay
 
04:45:21.590 --> 04:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
and came up with well we don't why don't
 
04:45:23.190 --> 04:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
we just change the neutral conference
 
04:45:25.948 --> 04:45:25.958 align:start position:0%
and then we'll have one less process but
 
04:45:28.110 --> 04:45:28.120 align:start position:0%
this will opport give an opportunity for
 
04:45:30.150 --> 04:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
parties to be able to see how it might
 
04:45:32.150 --> 04:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
go without spending all the time and
 
04:45:34.910 --> 04:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
effort on a due process hearing
 
04:45:36.788 --> 04:45:36.798 align:start position:0%
my long-winded explanation
 
04:45:36.798 --> 04:45:38.030 align:start position:0%
my long-winded explanation
representative

04:45:38.030 --> 04:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:45:40.110 --> 04:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
Corell thank you and thank you for
 
04:45:42.230 --> 04:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question how was this offered
 
04:45:45.430 --> 04:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
to the two parties is it like if it if
 
04:45:47.110 --> 04:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
if it people aren't agreeing and you
 
04:45:48.550 --> 04:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
think it's going to go to Due Process
 
04:45:50.788 --> 04:45:50.798 align:start position:0%
does somebody say you know this is an
 
04:45:52.670 --> 04:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
option want to try this
 
04:45:56.270 --> 04:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
or um it's on the it's
 
04:45:59.510 --> 04:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
well it's on the website but also when
 
04:46:02.430 --> 04:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
parties request a due process hearing we
 
04:46:06.430 --> 04:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
do a uh a presumptive mediation any way
 
04:46:07.948 --> 04:46:07.958 align:start position:0%
that they can opt out of and if they
 
04:46:10.030 --> 04:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
decide to change that to a neutral
 
04:46:11.830 --> 04:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
conference or third party that
 
04:46:13.190 --> 04:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
information is
 
04:46:16.510 --> 04:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
available um and it so that's how the
 
04:46:18.230 --> 04:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
options come about or if they call and
 
04:46:20.550 --> 04:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
ask what do you have available we
 
04:46:23.628 --> 04:46:23.638 align:start position:0%
provide that to them as
 
04:46:26.830 --> 04:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
well further questions from the
 
04:46:29.548 --> 04:46:29.558 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much don't any
 
04:46:32.510 --> 04:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
hands thank you uh i' like to invite uh
 
04:46:51.310 --> 04:46:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:53.350 --> 04:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh chairman ladin education committee
 
04:46:58.430 --> 04:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to oppose this bill um on
 
04:46:59.868 --> 04:46:59.878 align:start position:0%
its face I don't have any issue with
 
04:47:01.990 --> 04:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
neutral conference however neutral
 
04:47:04.510 --> 04:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
conference is not an access access
 
04:47:06.390 --> 04:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
format to normal parents who don't have
 
04:47:08.230 --> 04:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
a legal background I don't know if
 
04:47:09.590 --> 04:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
anybody here has ever gone through
 
04:47:11.670 --> 04:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
neutral conference but you actually lay
 
04:47:14.628 --> 04:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
out a legal case and the person gives
 
04:47:16.150 --> 04:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
you a legal opinion on what they think
 
04:47:17.628 --> 04:47:17.638 align:start position:0%
would happen with your case if you
 
04:47:19.150 --> 04:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
actually went through with it in full
 
04:47:21.868 --> 04:47:21.878 align:start position:0%
court um because of that I don't feel
 
04:47:23.830 --> 04:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
that people who don't speak English I
 
04:47:25.230 --> 04:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
don't feel that parents who cannot
 
04:47:27.948 --> 04:47:27.958 align:start position:0%
afford an attorney and I don't feel that
 
04:47:30.030 --> 04:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
um prosay parents can adequately
 
04:47:31.708 --> 04:47:31.718 align:start position:0%
represent themselves and that's why I
 
04:47:33.750 --> 04:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
oppose it I actually think that neutral
 
04:47:35.510 --> 04:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
conf conf should be struck from the
 
04:47:37.510 --> 04:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
options and we should reduce the number
 
04:47:39.270 --> 04:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
of options that are available most
 
04:47:41.470 --> 04:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
parents don't know what neutral
 
04:47:44.390 --> 04:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
conference is and um I work on a
 
04:47:45.788 --> 04:47:45.798 align:start position:0%
committee that deals with dispute
 
04:47:47.708 --> 04:47:47.718 align:start position:0%
resolution and um parent information
 
04:47:50.830 --> 04:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
center had recommended to strike it and
 
04:47:52.270 --> 04:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
at first I had thought people should
 
04:47:54.628 --> 04:47:54.638 align:start position:0%
have as many options as possible but in
 
04:47:56.470 --> 04:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
consideration of it I actually do agree
 
04:47:57.830 --> 04:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
that it should be stricken and there
 
04:47:59.590 --> 04:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
should be fewer options and things that
 
04:48:01.350 --> 04:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
are more accessible to parents and
 
04:48:02.910 --> 04:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
ordinary people who have to represent
 
04:48:05.470 --> 04:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
themselves prosay because again it costs
 
04:48:08.070 --> 04:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
$20,000 just for a file review and
 
04:48:11.030 --> 04:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's the price of a small car so with
 
04:48:12.628 --> 04:48:12.638 align:start position:0%
that being said I do oppose this bill
 
04:48:14.310 --> 04:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any
 
04:48:17.788 --> 04:48:17.798 align:start position:0%
questions 20,000 a money for a very very
 
04:48:20.750 --> 04:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
small car would that's true but that
 
04:48:23.070 --> 04:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
means a lot to me $20,000 for me to Fork
 
04:48:25.390 --> 04:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
out is quite a bit of money sir okay are
 
04:48:28.470 --> 04:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:30.430 --> 04:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
questions I don't see any hands thank
 
04:48:39.390 --> 04:48:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:41.390 --> 04:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
try I'm not going to go with that
 
04:48:41.400 --> 04:48:46.350 align:start position:0%
try I'm not going to go with that
Kristen

04:48:46.350 --> 04:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:48.310 --> 04:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
D Kristen
 
04:48:50.270 --> 04:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
manani okay Office of the special
 
04:48:52.110 --> 04:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
education Advocate and it is much easier
 
04:48:54.590 --> 04:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
if you're looking at it man sharani is
 
04:48:58.708 --> 04:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
sort of fonetic um I am opposed to this
 
04:49:01.230 --> 04:49:01.240 align:start position:0%
as well and I it will Echo a bit of what
 
04:49:03.070 --> 04:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
Miss Ryan just said but I want to get
 
04:49:06.190 --> 04:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
into a bit more Det in terms of what I
 
04:49:08.590 --> 04:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
am experiencing that our families
 
04:49:11.750 --> 04:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
experience and trying to settle disputes
 
04:49:15.628 --> 04:49:15.638 align:start position:0%
I first and foremost this idea that more
 
04:49:17.628 --> 04:49:17.638 align:start position:0%
choice is always better you know there's
 
04:49:19.948 --> 04:49:19.958 align:start position:0%
some psychology around this um and I
 
04:49:21.990 --> 04:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
think it definitely plays in in the
 
04:49:24.310 --> 04:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
special education dispute resolution it
 
04:49:26.868 --> 04:49:26.878 align:start position:0%
is not always better because parents are
 
04:49:29.270 --> 04:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
confused by the range of paths and
 
04:49:31.390 --> 04:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
options and choices that they have in
 
04:49:33.910 --> 04:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
front of them and no matter what they
 
04:49:36.030 --> 04:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
they choose they spend a lot of time and
 
04:49:40.070 --> 04:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
energy and sometimes money on whatever
 
04:49:41.510 --> 04:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
path they've chosen to go down for
 
04:49:41.520 --> 04:49:42.868 align:start position:0%
path they've chosen to go down for
dispute

04:49:42.868 --> 04:49:42.878 align:start position:0%
dispute
 
04:49:45.470 --> 04:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
resolution when it doesn't yield a
 
04:49:48.590 --> 04:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
result that they feel is fair you know
 
04:49:51.788 --> 04:49:51.798 align:start position:0%
you can have results that parents
 
04:49:54.230 --> 04:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
weren't looking for but that they at
 
04:49:56.750 --> 04:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
least feel like they have some
 
04:49:58.390 --> 04:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
transparency into the process and I
 
04:50:00.590 --> 04:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
actually have to commend um Mr Burwick
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
and I I I think the due process dispute
 
04:50:02.840 --> 04:50:04.628 align:start position:0%
and I I I think the due process dispute
resolution

04:50:04.628 --> 04:50:04.638 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
04:50:07.390 --> 04:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
here um it is very difficult for parents
 
04:50:08.910 --> 04:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
to navigate on their own but I think
 
04:50:11.030 --> 04:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
there is transparency to it and I think
 
04:50:13.830 --> 04:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
that when parents go through it they
 
04:50:17.430 --> 04:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
really can point to okay what caused my
 
04:50:19.110 --> 04:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
case to go for me or against me and I
 
04:50:23.150 --> 04:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
heard everyone's testimony Etc um so to
 
04:50:25.310 --> 04:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
come back to the neutral conference and
 
04:50:28.470 --> 04:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
to set the stage a bit here the neutral
 
04:50:30.310 --> 04:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
conference is part of an alternative
 
04:50:33.070 --> 04:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution set of options
 
04:50:35.548 --> 04:50:35.558 align:start position:0%
there's also a dispute resolution set of
 
04:50:37.990 --> 04:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
options where due process lives and
 
04:50:40.350 --> 04:50:40.360 align:start position:0%
where filing a state complaint live and
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
so a parent has to actually sort that
 
04:50:43.868 --> 04:50:43.878 align:start position:0%
out as well should I be filing a state
 
04:50:45.868 --> 04:50:45.878 align:start position:0%
complaint should I be filing a request
 
04:50:48.430 --> 04:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
for a due process hearing and then there
 
04:50:50.230 --> 04:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
are many steps after you file the
 
04:50:51.708 --> 04:50:51.718 align:start position:0%
request for the due process hearing most
 
04:50:54.750 --> 04:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
of which parents do not understand as
 
04:50:56.190 --> 04:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
they go into
 
04:50:58.868 --> 04:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
them before you even get to Alternative
 
04:51:00.548 --> 04:51:00.558 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution which is your neutral
 
04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
conferences and your mediations
 
04:51:04.430 --> 04:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
mediation is also part of the dispute
 
04:51:07.270 --> 04:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
resolution due process you've gone
 
04:51:09.708 --> 04:51:09.718 align:start position:0%
through numerous IEP team meetings you
 
04:51:12.350 --> 04:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
might have have had IEP facilitation
 
04:51:14.510 --> 04:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
that you've heard of here so you feel as
 
04:51:16.310 --> 04:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
a parent you're you you already feel
 
04:51:18.110 --> 04:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
like you've tried and tried and tried
 
04:51:19.548 --> 04:51:19.558 align:start position:0%
sometimes for years to settle these
 
04:51:21.548 --> 04:51:21.558 align:start position:0%
disputes before you get to either
 
04:51:23.310 --> 04:51:23.320 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution or alternative
 
04:51:25.590 --> 04:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution so then having
 
04:51:28.230 --> 04:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
numerous options in each of those I
 
04:51:29.470 --> 04:51:29.480 align:start position:0%
actually think takes away from the
 
04:51:31.670 --> 04:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
process I think it it has led to a lot
 
04:51:33.350 --> 04:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
more frustration from parents because
 
04:51:36.070 --> 04:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
they feel like I've filed complaints
 
04:51:38.110 --> 04:51:38.120 align:start position:0%
everywhere I could find to file them and
 
04:51:40.708 --> 04:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
I've spent tons of money sometimes if I
 
04:51:42.510 --> 04:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
do have representation or I've spent
 
04:51:45.670 --> 04:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
years of my child's educational life
 
04:51:47.310 --> 04:51:47.320 align:start position:0%
trying to solve
 
04:51:49.670 --> 04:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
disputes I think you know what I'm
 
04:51:51.548 --> 04:51:51.558 align:start position:0%
hoping that my agency will be able to
 
04:51:53.430 --> 04:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
work with the oon is is some
 
04:51:55.868 --> 04:51:55.878 align:start position:0%
simplification of some of this and some
 
04:51:58.190 --> 04:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
really um in-depth discussions
 
04:52:00.788 --> 04:52:00.798 align:start position:0%
about how do we make it so that parents
 
04:52:02.948 --> 04:52:02.958 align:start position:0%
are not sort of circling the system in
 
04:52:05.030 --> 04:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
all these different dispute Mech
 
04:52:08.190 --> 04:52:08.200 align:start position:0%
resolution mechanisms for years so
 
04:52:10.150 --> 04:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
neutral conference
 
04:52:12.868 --> 04:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
specifically um I I probably am much
 
04:52:15.150 --> 04:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
more with Miss Ryan but I'm not sure how
 
04:52:17.470 --> 04:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
useful that mechanism is and I have
 
04:52:19.910 --> 04:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
concerns about it from the perspective
 
04:52:22.910 --> 04:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
of representing parents
 
04:52:26.070 --> 04:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
so I found our mediation process to be
 
04:52:29.548 --> 04:52:29.558 align:start position:0%
reasonably um useful and many of the
 
04:52:32.830 --> 04:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
things that are delineated here as
 
04:52:35.310 --> 04:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
options we want to have in the neutral
 
04:52:37.548 --> 04:52:37.558 align:start position:0%
conference I think are already happening
 
04:52:40.310 --> 04:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
potentially in mediation now parents can
 
04:52:42.628 --> 04:52:42.638 align:start position:0%
request mediation or districts can
 
04:52:44.708 --> 04:52:44.718 align:start position:0%
request mediation as an alternative
 
04:52:47.510 --> 04:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution or they can opt into
 
04:52:50.070 --> 04:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
it as one step along the way to their
 
04:52:51.750 --> 04:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
due process hearing if they've requested
 
04:52:54.110 --> 04:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
the due process dispute
 
04:52:56.350 --> 04:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
resolution in
 
04:52:59.628 --> 04:52:59.638 align:start position:0%
mediation it is more informal and it's
 
04:53:00.868 --> 04:53:00.878 align:start position:0%
more of a comfortable setting for
 
04:53:02.868 --> 04:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
parents I'm not saying parents don't
 
04:53:06.548 --> 04:53:06.558 align:start position:0%
benefit from having an adviser with them
 
04:53:09.948 --> 04:53:09.958 align:start position:0%
they do in mediation but in mediation
 
04:53:11.430 --> 04:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
that those same hearing officers who
 
04:53:12.948 --> 04:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
would be the hearing officers in neutral
 
04:53:15.350 --> 04:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
conference are breaking breaking out
 
04:53:16.910 --> 04:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
into sessions it's a much more
 
04:53:19.708 --> 04:53:19.718 align:start position:0%
conversational piece they're talking to
 
04:53:23.270 --> 04:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
each side independently they are
 
04:53:24.430 --> 04:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
answering questions I found the
 
04:53:26.628 --> 04:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
mediators more than willing to answer
 
04:53:29.708 --> 04:53:29.718 align:start position:0%
questions about whether they think that
 
04:53:31.910 --> 04:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
the parents claim and the type of relief
 
04:53:33.230 --> 04:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
the parent might be seeking in due
 
04:53:35.830 --> 04:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
process is viable with they as a hearing
 
04:53:37.548 --> 04:53:37.558 align:start position:0%
officer if the
 
04:53:40.910 --> 04:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
facts lined up orward that type of
 
04:53:43.670 --> 04:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
relief um you know they when I've
 
04:53:45.230 --> 04:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
participated with parents in mediations
 
04:53:48.510 --> 04:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
the hearing officers they the mediators
 
04:53:50.390 --> 04:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
um are pretty open they're pretty they
 
04:53:51.788 --> 04:53:51.798 align:start position:0%
they discuss they go back and forth
 
04:53:54.350 --> 04:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
between the sides often extensively and
 
04:53:56.110 --> 04:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
I think it is a much less intimidating
 
04:53:59.110 --> 04:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
process for parents I also think it
 
04:54:02.708 --> 04:54:02.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't require that they be prepared to
 
04:54:05.150 --> 04:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
lay out the of legal case with all of
 
04:54:07.350 --> 04:54:07.360 align:start position:0%
their documents you know in order the
 
04:54:10.548 --> 04:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
exhibits they're going to refer to um
 
04:54:10.558 --> 04:54:11.430 align:start position:0%
exhibits they're going to refer to um
the

04:54:11.430 --> 04:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:54:14.110 --> 04:54:14.120 align:start position:0%
writeups um extensively that they would
 
04:54:15.430 --> 04:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
put in for a neutral conference it
 
04:54:17.270 --> 04:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't require that they be prepared
 
04:54:18.708 --> 04:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
for that in the same way that a neutral
 
04:54:18.718 --> 04:54:19.708 align:start position:0%
for that in the same way that a neutral
conference

04:54:19.708 --> 04:54:19.718 align:start position:0%
conference
 
04:54:21.910 --> 04:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
does whether or not even if you had a
 
04:54:24.628 --> 04:54:24.638 align:start position:0%
school district on one side and the
 
04:54:26.110 --> 04:54:26.120 align:start position:0%
family on the other in a neutral
 
04:54:28.510 --> 04:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
conference and if neither party was
 
04:54:31.708 --> 04:54:31.718 align:start position:0%
represented in that conference by
 
04:54:34.230 --> 04:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
Advocates or attorneys
 
04:54:35.910 --> 04:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
your District
 
04:54:37.910 --> 04:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
Representatives have they they are
 
04:54:40.270 --> 04:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
experts in the special education field
 
04:54:43.590 --> 04:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
they have without a doubt discussed that
 
04:54:43.600 --> 04:54:45.110 align:start position:0%
they have without a doubt discussed that
specific

04:54:45.110 --> 04:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
specific
 
04:54:48.708 --> 04:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
situation over months or or longer with
 
04:54:50.150 --> 04:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
the district
 
04:54:53.070 --> 04:54:53.080 align:start position:0%
attorneys so they're set up to
 
04:54:54.628 --> 04:54:54.638 align:start position:0%
understand what the legal issues they're
 
04:54:56.670 --> 04:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
presenting are going into that neutral
 
04:54:58.750 --> 04:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
conference the families on the other
 
04:55:00.868 --> 04:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
hand are just talking about their
 
04:55:02.548 --> 04:55:02.558 align:start position:0%
frustrations if they have no legal
 
04:55:04.948 --> 04:55:04.958 align:start position:0%
counsel they really may not know how to
 
04:55:08.510 --> 04:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
ground their argument in something that
 
04:55:10.750 --> 04:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
um can be offered legally and I know
 
04:55:11.990 --> 04:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
that one of the things we've said is
 
04:55:13.590 --> 04:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
okay the hearing officers will give you
 
04:55:15.990 --> 04:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
some options they'll try to maybe help
 
04:55:17.830 --> 04:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
you think that way I think that happens
 
04:55:19.110 --> 04:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
much more in
 
04:55:21.470 --> 04:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
mediation I think the neutral conference
 
04:55:25.670 --> 04:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
format with the formality of it um puts
 
04:55:29.230 --> 04:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
a hand on the district side of the scale
 
04:55:30.270 --> 04:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
because they're going to be more
 
04:55:32.310 --> 04:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
prepared for that formal presentation
 
04:55:34.110 --> 04:55:34.120 align:start position:0%
and the parent walks out of that having
 
04:55:36.190 --> 04:55:36.200 align:start position:0%
spent again tons of time put a lot of
 
04:55:40.190 --> 04:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
hopes into this with a an
 
04:55:42.510 --> 04:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
opinion that they either do or don't
 
04:55:46.548 --> 04:55:46.558 align:start position:0%
have a legal case um that I think really
 
04:55:46.558 --> 04:55:47.990 align:start position:0%
have a legal case um that I think really
influences

04:55:47.990 --> 04:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
influences
 
04:55:50.750 --> 04:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
their propensity to settle or to keep
 
04:55:52.590 --> 04:55:52.600 align:start position:0%
pursuing something that is actually to
 
04:55:56.150 --> 04:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
their satisfaction um I again here I
 
04:55:58.590 --> 04:55:58.600 align:start position:0%
just I don't think it's not it's not
 
04:56:01.430 --> 04:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
a forum for dispute resolution that I
 
04:56:03.708 --> 04:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
would recommend to unrepresented parents
 
04:56:06.628 --> 04:56:06.638 align:start position:0%
I'd rather see them not be so reticent
 
04:56:08.990 --> 04:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
or hesitant to go down the due process
 
04:56:11.590 --> 04:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
path um and what I hope we can do is
 
04:56:14.110 --> 04:56:14.120 align:start position:0%
expand the core of Advocates Etc you
 
04:56:16.190 --> 04:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
know people who can uh represent
 
04:56:18.548 --> 04:56:18.558 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:56:19.910 --> 04:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
you so much for being here and for
 
04:56:23.030 --> 04:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
testifying a number of bills today I
 
04:56:25.548 --> 04:56:25.558 align:start position:0%
understand that you do not favor the
 
04:56:29.030 --> 04:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
concept of a neutral conference and this
 
04:56:31.830 --> 04:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
bill is not instituting that into law
 
04:56:34.390 --> 04:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
it's already in statute it just has some
 
04:56:36.990 --> 04:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
changes to how the neutral conference
 
04:56:40.110 --> 04:56:40.120 align:start position:0%
would go about specifically line six
 
04:56:41.670 --> 04:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
where it would say selecting a neutral
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
on a rotational basis do you believe
 
04:56:46.110 --> 04:56:46.120 align:start position:0%
that would improve the neutral cont
 
04:56:47.670 --> 04:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
conference and address some of the
 
04:56:49.310 --> 04:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
concerns that you mentioned or would
 
04:56:51.110 --> 04:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
this make the process even more
 
04:56:53.510 --> 04:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
confusing or difficult for parents so I
 
04:56:55.548 --> 04:56:55.558 align:start position:0%
don't think those lines on how we select
 
04:56:57.628 --> 04:56:57.638 align:start position:0%
the neutrals have an impact one way or
 
04:57:00.110 --> 04:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
another from the from the the fairness
 
04:57:01.708 --> 04:57:01.718 align:start position:0%
to either side or whether I would
 
04:57:03.750 --> 04:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
recommend the process I think you know I
 
04:57:06.830 --> 04:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
would favor giving doe that flexibility
 
04:57:08.628 --> 04:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
um as they said they have a limited
 
04:57:11.230 --> 04:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
number of uh people who serve in these
 
04:57:13.990 --> 04:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
roles um so I don't have any concern
 
04:57:17.110 --> 04:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
with that I do have some concerns with
 
04:57:19.310 --> 04:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
kind of expanding the options for those
 
04:57:21.350 --> 04:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
officers expanding the idea of the
 
04:57:24.150 --> 04:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
neutral conference theoretically with
 
04:57:27.990 --> 04:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
the idea to make it more accessible
 
04:57:29.590 --> 04:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
because I I don't think that's really
 
04:57:31.628 --> 04:57:31.638 align:start position:0%
what will happen I don't think it will
 
04:57:33.868 --> 04:57:33.878 align:start position:0%
be beneficial to parents
 
04:57:35.788 --> 04:57:35.798 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions
 
04:57:39.510 --> 04:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative Miler thank you Mr chair
 
04:57:42.470 --> 04:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here uh I need
 
04:57:44.390 --> 04:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
help I mean a lot of people think I need
 
04:57:47.270 --> 04:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
help but on this particular thing I do
 
04:57:52.390 --> 04:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
because I'm confused at options here so
 
04:57:54.470 --> 04:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
if you help me walk through this all
 
04:57:57.430 --> 04:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
right so we've we've come up with an as
 
04:57:59.910 --> 04:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
I understand it we come up with an
 
04:58:04.350 --> 04:58:04.360 align:start position:0%
IEP and as a parent I have some concerns
 
04:58:08.070 --> 04:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
about my issues for my child are not
 
04:58:11.270 --> 04:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
being met by that IEP and I want to
 
04:58:14.270 --> 04:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
challenge that process so if you could
 
04:58:17.150 --> 04:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
be if you could very
 
04:58:20.430 --> 04:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
rudiment say you've got this option to
 
04:58:23.910 --> 04:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
pursue you've got this option to pursue
 
04:58:27.590 --> 04:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
and help clarify in my mind exactly what
 
04:58:31.030 --> 04:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
that uh what that appeal process the
 
04:58:33.150 --> 04:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
various phases of the appeal process
 
04:58:34.948 --> 04:58:34.958 align:start position:0%
process that would be very helpful for
 
04:58:37.750 --> 04:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
me if you could do that sure I'm going
 
04:58:39.830 --> 04:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
to try to do this as succinctly as
 
04:58:41.670 --> 04:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
possible your question gets at the heart
 
04:58:43.510 --> 04:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
of the issue here of
 
04:58:46.750 --> 04:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
why there is so much confusion to
 
04:58:51.310 --> 04:58:51.320 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution so um when families
 
04:58:54.628 --> 04:58:54.638 align:start position:0%
come to our office and say by the way
 
04:58:56.830 --> 04:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
we've crossed a hurdle already by saying
 
04:58:58.510 --> 04:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
the child has an IEP because it means
 
04:58:59.868 --> 04:58:59.878 align:start position:0%
we've gone through a whole referral
 
04:59:01.470 --> 04:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
process and evaluations and had them
 
04:59:02.628 --> 04:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
designated and there are some parents
 
04:59:04.830 --> 04:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
who are are fighting way back at that
 
04:59:08.030 --> 04:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
step um that they you know that the
 
04:59:10.270 --> 04:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
school is telling them you don't need
 
04:59:12.628 --> 04:59:12.638 align:start position:0%
services and the parents say yes we do
 
04:59:13.750 --> 04:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
but let's say we've gotten through that
 
04:59:18.390 --> 04:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
we have the IEP um so this goes you know
 
04:59:20.310 --> 04:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
before I launch into this tangent I like
 
04:59:22.470 --> 04:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
to tell people where it's going so I'm
 
04:59:23.948 --> 04:59:23.958 align:start position:0%
going to tell you the kinds of questions
 
04:59:26.150 --> 04:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
I would ask and then I'm going to say
 
04:59:28.230 --> 04:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
remember I said that I think it's very
 
04:59:30.708 --> 04:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
hard as a parent to present your legal
 
04:59:33.150 --> 04:59:33.160 align:start position:0%
case well if you haven't had any
 
04:59:34.708 --> 04:59:34.718 align:start position:0%
preparation and the districts know
 
04:59:36.788 --> 04:59:36.798 align:start position:0%
exactly where to present the legal
 
04:59:37.990 --> 04:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
issues in their case because they're
 
04:59:40.150 --> 04:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
experts in this so I often say to
 
04:59:42.190 --> 04:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
families who call okay I'm going to ask
 
04:59:43.350 --> 04:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
a few
 
04:59:46.470 --> 04:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
questions what specifically is the
 
04:59:47.948 --> 04:59:47.958 align:start position:0%
designation of disability in your
 
04:59:47.958 --> 04:59:49.190 align:start position:0%
designation of disability in your
child's

04:59:49.190 --> 04:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
child's
 
04:59:51.230 --> 04:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
IEP most of my families even though
 
04:59:53.270 --> 04:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
they're in dispute resolution can't
 
04:59:55.030 --> 04:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
actually answer that question until we
 
04:59:57.070 --> 04:59:57.080 align:start position:0%
look at the IEP that's because there
 
04:59:58.990 --> 04:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
were about 13 categories one of them is
 
05:00:00.270 --> 05:00:00.280 align:start position:0%
something as big as other health
 
05:00:02.270 --> 05:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
impairment which could accom you know
 
05:00:04.510 --> 05:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
cover a whole bunch of things all of
 
05:00:07.990 --> 05:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
these point to where your services are
 
05:00:09.470 --> 05:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
you know your your designation of
 
05:00:11.788 --> 05:00:11.798 align:start position:0%
disability tends to drive your areas of
 
05:00:14.430 --> 05:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
need your service providers and your
 
05:00:16.430 --> 05:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
related service providers
 
05:00:20.350 --> 05:00:20.360 align:start position:0%
Etc so we we get to that question I ask
 
05:00:23.070 --> 05:00:23.080 align:start position:0%
them you know who are the providers in
 
05:00:24.470 --> 05:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
in your what does Your Service delivery
 
05:00:26.070 --> 05:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
grid look like what kinds of services is
 
05:00:27.788 --> 05:00:27.798 align:start position:0%
your child having and how many times a
 
05:00:29.750 --> 05:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
week and from
 
05:00:32.350 --> 05:00:32.360 align:start position:0%
whom also tough for parents to look at
 
05:00:34.030 --> 05:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
we usually have to go to the IEP look at
 
05:00:35.708 --> 05:00:35.718 align:start position:0%
the service delivery grid actually do
 
05:00:39.070 --> 05:00:39.080 align:start position:0%
track it through what specifically are
 
05:00:41.310 --> 05:00:41.320 align:start position:0%
the goals in your child's
 
05:00:44.788 --> 05:00:44.798 align:start position:0%
IEP in the areas of need that that you
 
05:00:46.590 --> 05:00:46.600 align:start position:0%
don't think are adequate right or that
 
05:00:48.510 --> 05:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
Services aren't
 
05:00:51.310 --> 05:00:51.320 align:start position:0%
meeting often these IEPs are 30 page
 
05:00:54.110 --> 05:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
very legal documents those goals you
 
05:00:56.270 --> 05:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
have to really go through and find and
 
05:00:58.548 --> 05:00:58.558 align:start position:0%
we have to look it is it that the goals
 
05:01:01.390 --> 05:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
are written wrong they're not specific
 
05:01:04.868 --> 05:01:04.878 align:start position:0%
enough they don't give you measurable
 
05:01:06.990 --> 05:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
progress and then the fourth question is
 
05:01:08.750 --> 05:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
really just where's your child placed is
 
05:01:11.708 --> 05:01:11.718 align:start position:0%
your child full inclusion do they have a
 
05:01:13.708 --> 05:01:13.718 align:start position:0%
resource room placement do they have a
 
05:01:16.270 --> 05:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
special education separate special
 
05:01:18.868 --> 05:01:18.878 align:start position:0%
education room placement between those
 
05:01:20.190 --> 05:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
three often parents don't know the
 
05:01:21.230 --> 05:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
answer they do know the answer if
 
05:01:22.830 --> 05:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
they're in a separate special education
 
05:01:24.910 --> 05:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
school or or you know more restrictive
 
05:01:27.230 --> 05:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
so there are so many different places
 
05:01:28.948 --> 05:01:28.958 align:start position:0%
that your dispute
 
05:01:31.390 --> 05:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
really properly could be lodged and what
 
05:01:33.470 --> 05:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
parents know to say is my child's just
 
05:01:36.510 --> 05:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
not making progress or school's going
 
05:01:39.270 --> 05:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
really wrong for them and to actually
 
05:01:41.990 --> 05:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
make the case for a lot of these
 
05:01:45.628 --> 05:01:45.638 align:start position:0%
resolutions if they're that unspecific
 
05:01:47.548 --> 05:01:47.558 align:start position:0%
then you're going to an IEP team meeting
 
05:01:49.470 --> 05:01:49.480 align:start position:0%
as your first step and saying that I
 
05:01:50.708 --> 05:01:50.718 align:start position:0%
don't feel like my child's making
 
05:01:51.990 --> 05:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
progress these are the things that feel
 
05:01:54.670 --> 05:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
like they're going wrong with
 
05:01:56.788 --> 05:01:56.798 align:start position:0%
school so then it's incumbent on the
 
05:01:58.230 --> 05:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
district team to sort of say to the
 
05:02:00.948 --> 05:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
parent okay here are ways we can solve
 
05:02:03.670 --> 05:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
that you know we can look at a referrals
 
05:02:04.910 --> 05:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
we can look at your
 
05:02:07.350 --> 05:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
goals um we think there is progress
 
05:02:09.948 --> 05:02:09.958 align:start position:0%
under your goals Etc this can be long
 
05:02:11.830 --> 05:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
processes it's can be months of time
 
05:02:13.270 --> 05:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
that goes by with this and you might
 
05:02:15.270 --> 05:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
disagree you have the IEP team
 
05:02:17.350 --> 05:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
facilitations so that's step number two
 
05:02:19.110 --> 05:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
right not everyone takes advantage of
 
05:02:22.230 --> 05:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
that um our office we would go and and
 
05:02:24.350 --> 05:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
be helping parents in those I AP team
 
05:02:25.708 --> 05:02:25.718 align:start position:0%
meetings first we've usually been in
 
05:02:27.628 --> 05:02:27.638 align:start position:0%
several I AP team meetings before we get
 
05:02:29.510 --> 05:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
to any kind of dispute
 
05:02:32.470 --> 05:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
resolution at that point parents have an
 
05:02:32.480 --> 05:02:34.310 align:start position:0%
resolution at that point parents have an
option

05:02:34.310 --> 05:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
option
 
05:02:35.390 --> 05:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
does the type of thing you're
 
05:02:37.390 --> 05:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
complaining about fall better under a
 
05:02:40.430 --> 05:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
state complaint which goes to the doe
 
05:02:42.350 --> 05:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
there's not a ton of transparency it
 
05:02:43.868 --> 05:02:43.878 align:start position:0%
would be articulated as something that
 
05:02:45.750 --> 05:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
the district is is not complying with
 
05:02:47.230 --> 05:02:47.240 align:start position:0%
the law there's an
 
05:02:49.670 --> 05:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
investigation parents do not see all of
 
05:02:49.680 --> 05:02:51.030 align:start position:0%
investigation parents do not see all of
that

05:02:51.030 --> 05:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:02:54.030 --> 05:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
investigation they will see a decision
 
05:02:55.708 --> 05:02:55.718 align:start position:0%
from the commissioner of
 
05:02:58.270 --> 05:02:58.280 align:start position:0%
Education as a result of that
 
05:03:01.230 --> 05:03:01.240 align:start position:0%
investigation usually a couple Pages
 
05:03:03.070 --> 05:03:03.080 align:start position:0%
instructing something where ing the
 
05:03:04.548 --> 05:03:04.558 align:start position:0%
District of having done something wrong
 
05:03:07.310 --> 05:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
there so parents could choose
 
05:03:09.750 --> 05:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
that or they could choose one of these
 
05:03:11.670 --> 05:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolution they
 
05:03:13.670 --> 05:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
could choose to have a neutral
 
05:03:15.430 --> 05:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
conference or a
 
05:03:17.628 --> 05:03:17.638 align:start position:0%
mediation or they could choose to file
 
05:03:21.590 --> 05:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
for a due process hearing if they choose
 
05:03:24.070 --> 05:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
one and that's the one they have to take
 
05:03:26.708 --> 05:03:26.718 align:start position:0%
they can't come back and and double
 
05:03:29.548 --> 05:03:29.558 align:start position:0%
jeopardy so so to speak is that correct
 
05:03:31.948 --> 05:03:31.958 align:start position:0%
no not necessarily I would say not
 
05:03:33.868 --> 05:03:33.878 align:start position:0%
simultaneous ly for the most part
 
05:03:35.990 --> 05:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
without getting two in the weeds and I'd
 
05:03:38.628 --> 05:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
invite um Miss Fenton or Mr bck to
 
05:03:39.788 --> 05:03:39.798 align:start position:0%
correct me here afterwards if they'd
 
05:03:42.070 --> 05:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
like but um for the most part you're
 
05:03:44.470 --> 05:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
you're trying to go down One path at a
 
05:03:49.510 --> 05:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
time not all of the paths at a time but
 
05:03:51.750 --> 05:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
again we're taking time from a child's
 
05:03:53.270 --> 05:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
education and we're taking a parent's
 
05:03:56.190 --> 05:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
resources and energy so this can be
 
05:03:58.628 --> 05:03:58.638 align:start position:0%
yearslong processes depending on how you
 
05:04:00.948 --> 05:04:00.958 align:start position:0%
pick to do this um which is why I'd like
 
05:04:04.948 --> 05:04:04.958 align:start position:0%
to see it streamlined um so so you could
 
05:04:06.310 --> 05:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
have picked neutral conference you could
 
05:04:07.390 --> 05:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
have picked mediation I think you
 
05:04:09.190 --> 05:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't pick the two at the same time
 
05:04:10.230 --> 05:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
right those are
 
05:04:12.070 --> 05:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
alternatives or you could have picked
 
05:04:14.070 --> 05:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
due process and ended up with a
 
05:04:17.230 --> 05:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
resolution session with the district
 
05:04:19.510 --> 05:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
first and then a mediation which
 
05:04:21.390 --> 05:04:21.400 align:start position:0%
involves a third party that resolution
 
05:04:24.070 --> 05:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
session with the district does not um
 
05:04:27.270 --> 05:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
and then and then SE several other steps
 
05:04:29.310 --> 05:04:29.320 align:start position:0%
um I I
 
05:04:32.548 --> 05:04:32.558 align:start position:0%
think you can hear from just how come
 
05:04:34.590 --> 05:04:34.600 align:start position:0%
complex it is to tryy to describe it
 
05:04:35.990 --> 05:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
because within every one of those steps
 
05:04:38.470 --> 05:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work so how hard it is
 
05:04:40.270 --> 05:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
for parents is get on to another
 
05:04:43.430 --> 05:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
question representa K Kaden thank you Mr
 
05:04:45.430 --> 05:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you so I want to kind of
 
05:04:48.510 --> 05:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
organize this in my mind and want either
 
05:04:51.270 --> 05:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
verification from you or not the way I'm
 
05:04:53.830 --> 05:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
interpreting it there are two ways of
 
05:04:57.948 --> 05:04:57.958 align:start position:0%
alternative disputes informal informal
 
05:05:00.708 --> 05:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
this morning we talked about IEP
 
05:05:03.110 --> 05:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
facilitation in my mind
 
05:05:06.590 --> 05:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
that would be an informal process to get
 
05:05:09.670 --> 05:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
another professional to advise on a
 
05:05:12.910 --> 05:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
consensus on an IEP goal or a placement
 
05:05:16.190 --> 05:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
or something to that effect whereas the
 
05:05:18.510 --> 05:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
neutral conference Falls more in the
 
05:05:21.230 --> 05:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
formal realm which might be a process
 
05:05:24.830 --> 05:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
just prior to doe to due
 
05:05:29.990 --> 05:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
process on the legal side is does that
 
05:05:33.628 --> 05:05:33.638 align:start position:0%
sort of pocket it or not all right I'm
 
05:05:35.350 --> 05:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
going to try it this way in two or three
 
05:05:37.270 --> 05:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
sentences can you try to do that now
 
05:05:39.470 --> 05:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
quickly because we're so up here you
 
05:05:42.670 --> 05:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
have IEP team meetings and IEP
 
05:05:45.270 --> 05:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
facilitation levels one and
 
05:05:47.670 --> 05:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
1A then you could go to either
 
05:05:50.708 --> 05:05:50.718 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolution which is
 
05:05:53.030 --> 05:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
either mediation or a neutral conference
 
05:05:55.830 --> 05:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
okay or you could go to formal dispute
 
05:05:58.310 --> 05:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
resolution a state complaint or due
 
05:06:00.350 --> 05:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
process okay under those there are many
 
05:06:02.150 --> 05:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
other options all right thank you thank
 
05:06:03.830 --> 05:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
you are there further questions from the
 
05:06:05.788 --> 05:06:05.798 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
05:06:07.948 --> 05:06:07.958 align:start position:0%
Damon could you please send us a
 
05:06:10.230 --> 05:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
document of what you just diagrammed and
 
05:06:14.470 --> 05:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
I am serious sure no right I I I will
 
05:06:16.230 --> 05:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
coordinate with the OE to make sure we
 
05:06:18.030 --> 05:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
all agree on that flowchart are there
 
05:06:19.788 --> 05:06:19.798 align:start position:0%
further further questions from the
 
05:06:22.628 --> 05:06:22.638 align:start position:0%

um um from the neutral
 
05:06:33.310 --> 05:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
conference um if you do not select an
 
05:06:37.990 --> 05:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
option um and maybe they say that um
 
05:06:40.750 --> 05:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
there might be a legal
 
05:06:44.670 --> 05:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
case uh then do you switch
 
05:06:48.830 --> 05:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
tracks um and jump over to dispute
 
05:06:52.868 --> 05:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
resolution you could okay simple answer
 
05:06:54.628 --> 05:06:54.638 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much are there

policy problems of national significance
 
05:09:55.390 --> 05:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
these are identified by the office of

the Secretary of Defense the military

military
 
05:10:06.910 --> 05:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
families through the implementation of
 
05:10:08.990 --> 05:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
these policy changes New Hampshire can
 
05:10:11.150 --> 05:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
ensure service members are ready to
 
05:10:13.190 --> 05:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
support the military Mission because the
 
05:10:15.230 --> 05:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
state is supporting their children
 
05:10:17.190 --> 05:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
creating an environment for military

resilience Readiness and retention
 
05:10:25.590 --> 05:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
military children are largely adaptable
 
05:10:27.670 --> 05:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
and demonstrate both flexibility and
 
05:10:29.708 --> 05:10:29.718 align:start position:0%
resilience during permanent change of
 
05:10:32.628 --> 05:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
station transitions however for children
 
05:10:35.110 --> 05:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
with disabilities and transitions can be
 
05:10:36.590 --> 05:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
difficult because they often have
 
05:10:38.270 --> 05:10:38.280 align:start position:0%

05:10:55.430 --> 05:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
with disabilities this cycle can be
 
05:10:57.510 --> 05:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
especially overwhelming as the burden to
 
05:10:59.708 --> 05:10:59.718 align:start position:0%
ensure continuity of care tends to fall
 
05:11:01.270 --> 05:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
in the family at a time when those
 
05:11:03.110 --> 05:11:03.120 align:start position:0%

to learning gaps these losses can be

magnified with each military move a
 
05:11:53.628 --> 05:11:53.638 align:start position:0%
study conducted in 2020 found that 51%

of active duty families with a child and
 
05:11:57.390 --> 05:11:57.400 align:start position:0%

transferring their child's IEP to their

new school another study conducted in
 
05:12:06.270 --> 05:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
2021 found that 31% of military families
 
05:12:07.948 --> 05:12:07.958 align:start position:0%
indicated that their children with
 
05:12:09.948 --> 05:12:09.958 align:start position:0%
disabilities went without services for
 
05:12:11.868 --> 05:12:11.878 align:start position:0%
more than 60 days following their
 
05:12:15.230 --> 05:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
military move and 42% reported that
 
05:12:17.590 --> 05:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
their IEP was not implemented once they
 
05:12:20.470 --> 05:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
arrived at their new Duty station states
 
05:12:22.430 --> 05:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
can ameliorate these issues in the
 
05:12:25.110 --> 05:12:25.120 align:start position:0%

mediation process filing a state

complaint and due process which
 
05:13:46.390 --> 05:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
typically involves hiring an attorney
 
05:13:48.270 --> 05:13:48.280 align:start position:0%
and potentially paying significant fees
 
05:13:49.390 --> 05:13:49.400 align:start position:0%

ensure the playing field is level
 
05:14:02.350 --> 05:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
between both parties there have been
 
05:14:04.310 --> 05:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
anecdotal reports of school systems
 
05:14:06.628 --> 05:14:06.638 align:start position:0%
delaying actions for the children of
 
05:14:09.030 --> 05:14:09.040 align:start position:0%

likely to have the time or money
 
05:14:14.548 --> 05:14:14.558 align:start position:0%
necessary to utilize these
 
05:14:17.310 --> 05:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
safeguards and even in cases where
 
05:14:19.590 --> 05:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
military parents are successful in due
 
05:14:22.150 --> 05:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
process hearings relocation of the
 
05:14:24.230 --> 05:14:24.240 align:start position:0%

executing the hearing officers orders
 
05:14:28.830 --> 05:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
very difficult to level the playing
 
05:14:32.110 --> 05:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
field for military children and to uh uh
 
05:14:33.788 --> 05:14:33.798 align:start position:0%
and to encourage school districts to
 
05:14:36.230 --> 05:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
work with parents to come to a consensus
 
05:14:38.868 --> 05:14:38.878 align:start position:0%
prior to Due Process states can take
 
05:14:40.788 --> 05:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
action to enhance these procedural
 
05:14:42.548 --> 05:14:42.558 align:start position:0%
safeguards this includes the
 
05:14:44.868 --> 05:14:44.878 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of expert witness fees
 
05:14:46.788 --> 05:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
should the hearing officer find in favor
 
05:14:49.670 --> 05:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
of the parent in conclusion the policies
 
05:14:51.788 --> 05:14:51.798 align:start position:0%
incorporated into this bill offer a
 
05:14:54.430 --> 05:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
framework to serve military families
 
05:14:56.830 --> 05:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
impa impacted by disabilities and
 
05:14:59.030 --> 05:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
enhance the resiliency and Readiness of
 
05:15:01.628 --> 05:15:01.638 align:start position:0%
our service members and their families
 
05:15:03.150 --> 05:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
we thank the committee for considering
 
05:15:05.270 --> 05:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
this important legislation and are
 
05:15:07.070 --> 05:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
especially grateful for the tremendous
 
05:15:08.948 --> 05:15:08.958 align:start position:0%
efforts New Hampshire has historically
 
05:15:10.868 --> 05:15:10.878 align:start position:0%
made in supporting our service members
 
05:15:12.990 --> 05:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
and their families we also thank the
 
05:15:15.270 --> 05:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor representative Terry Roy
 
05:15:17.948 --> 05:15:17.958 align:start position:0%
for his continued advocacy and support
 
05:15:19.948 --> 05:15:19.958 align:start position:0%
and for your service to our country uh
 
05:15:21.868 --> 05:15:21.878 align:start position:0%
as well Mr chair thank you thank you
 
05:15:23.910 --> 05:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
very much uh I'll start out with a
 
05:15:26.470 --> 05:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
question here um I can recall when we
 
05:15:28.590 --> 05:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
met and put the interstate compact in
 
05:15:32.470 --> 05:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
place in our statutory language and and
 
05:15:34.830 --> 05:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
I thought we had addressed some of these
 
05:15:36.628 --> 05:15:36.638 align:start position:0%
concerns and issues that you bring up
 
05:15:38.548 --> 05:15:38.558 align:start position:0%
where there there section when our
 
05:15:41.270 --> 05:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
interstate compact here military compact
 
05:15:43.310 --> 05:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
with that address special education
 
05:15:46.310 --> 05:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution attendance placement
 
05:15:51.868 --> 05:15:51.878 align:start position:0%
Etc there's also a portion I believe as
 
05:15:55.750 --> 05:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
I'm reading it here um where it's
 
05:15:58.110 --> 05:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
underneath uh oversight enforcement and
 
05:16:02.750 --> 05:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution it says that uh that
 
05:16:05.270 --> 05:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
the interstate commission can take an
 
05:16:08.110 --> 05:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
issue to The District Court the district
 
05:16:10.030 --> 05:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
Federal District Court either one in
 
05:16:14.110 --> 05:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
Washington DC or one other and the
 
05:16:16.510 --> 05:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
relief s may include both injunctive
 
05:16:19.110 --> 05:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
relief and damages in the event judicial
 
05:16:21.110 --> 05:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement is necessary the prevailing
 
05:16:23.708 --> 05:16:23.718 align:start position:0%
party shall be awarded all costs of such
 
05:16:26.070 --> 05:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
litigation including reasonable attorney
 
05:16:29.708 --> 05:16:29.718 align:start position:0%
fees so does that cover what we're
 
05:16:32.628 --> 05:16:32.638 align:start position:0%
trying to do in this bill I believe it
 
05:16:36.390 --> 05:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
would Mr chair however this policy um if
 
05:16:38.788 --> 05:16:38.798 align:start position:0%
implemented would allow the parents to
 
05:16:40.910 --> 05:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
not have to go through that particular
 
05:16:42.628 --> 05:16:42.638 align:start position:0%
process with the district court and
 
05:16:44.750 --> 05:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
would they would work directly with the
 
05:16:46.708 --> 05:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
school district in order to recoup those
 
05:16:48.990 --> 05:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
costs okay I followed up then we also
 
05:16:50.470 --> 05:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
have a portion within the military
 
05:16:53.788 --> 05:16:53.798 align:start position:0%
compact where the IEP that comes in from
 
05:16:56.270 --> 05:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
the sending District you might be
 
05:16:58.548 --> 05:16:58.558 align:start position:0%
somewhere over in the UK or wherever you
 
05:17:01.948 --> 05:17:01.958 align:start position:0%
may be or another state even um that the
 
05:17:04.390 --> 05:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
IEP must be filed the local district has
 
05:17:06.150 --> 05:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
the option to give another placement
 
05:17:08.670 --> 05:17:08.680 align:start position:0%
test and to subsequently develop an IEP
 
05:17:10.190 --> 05:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
that might be more current or
 
05:17:13.750 --> 05:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the setting their end so
 
05:17:16.590 --> 05:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
how with that being said we're still
 
05:17:20.070 --> 05:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
having to operate as we would do uh in
 
05:17:21.948 --> 05:17:21.958 align:start position:0%
accordance with this compact we'd have
 
05:17:24.948 --> 05:17:24.958 align:start position:0%
to immediately jump onto the whole
 
05:17:28.110 --> 05:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
process I'm I'm you know I I absolutely
 
05:17:30.230 --> 05:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
support this did back when we put it in
 
05:17:32.270 --> 05:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
the law but I'm wondering are is this
 
05:17:35.110 --> 05:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
becoming duplicative of what we have in
 
05:17:37.750 --> 05:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
law receiving states do have to
 
05:17:39.750 --> 05:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
initially provide those comparable
 
05:17:42.830 --> 05:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
services but it doesn't necessarily no
 
05:17:44.030 --> 05:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
there's no language that says
 
05:17:46.190 --> 05:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
immediately provide comparable services
 
05:17:47.990 --> 05:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
so our our military connected families
 
05:17:51.350 --> 05:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
are still having a problem receiving
 
05:17:53.948 --> 05:17:53.958 align:start position:0%
those services in a in a timely
 
05:17:58.708 --> 05:17:58.718 align:start position:0%
manner um so that's where this 30-day um
 
05:18:01.868 --> 05:18:01.878 align:start position:0%
policy proposal comes in
 
05:18:04.948 --> 05:18:04.958 align:start position:0%
and as part of the legislation it is the
 
05:18:07.510 --> 05:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's the due diligence of the parents to
 
05:18:11.510 --> 05:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
provide the current IEP for that student
 
05:18:14.190 --> 05:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
from the sending school before they
 
05:18:16.628 --> 05:18:16.638 align:start position:0%
transfer to the new school so that the
 
05:18:19.590 --> 05:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
receiving school will have that document
 
05:18:21.670 --> 05:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
upon arrival or before
 
05:18:24.190 --> 05:18:24.200 align:start position:0%
arrival and well I I don't want to
 
05:18:26.590 --> 05:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
become debating this thing but because I
 
05:18:29.190 --> 05:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
support everything you're saying but I
 
05:18:32.708 --> 05:18:32.718 align:start position:0%
feel it does say that in 110 n d colon 6
 
05:18:34.110 --> 05:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
placement and attendance and it's
 
05:18:36.030 --> 05:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
specifically special education it talks
 
05:18:39.548 --> 05:18:39.558 align:start position:0%
the IEPs 504 plans uh the whole nine
 
05:18:43.070 --> 05:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
yards and it says that um the receiving
 
05:18:46.590 --> 05:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
State shall initially provide comparable
 
05:18:48.788 --> 05:18:48.798 align:start position:0%
services and then have the option to
 
05:18:50.788 --> 05:18:50.798 align:start position:0%
even expand if they so
 
05:18:53.788 --> 05:18:53.798 align:start position:0%
desire and that to me means when the
 
05:18:57.390 --> 05:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
student walks in the in the door um you
 
05:18:59.110 --> 05:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility then to take
 
05:19:01.628 --> 05:19:01.638 align:start position:0%
action with that current IE panel that
 
05:19:03.750 --> 05:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
they're probably hand carrying with them
 
05:19:06.110 --> 05:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
UND understood sir um but it's it is
 
05:19:08.510 --> 05:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
still the experience of our our families
 
05:19:10.190 --> 05:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
that those services are not being
 
05:19:13.868 --> 05:19:13.878 align:start position:0%
provided so setting that 30-day timeline
 
05:19:14.910 --> 05:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
would help
 
05:19:17.948 --> 05:19:17.958 align:start position:0%
facilitate U those IEPs the creation of
 
05:19:19.270 --> 05:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
those I thank you are there questions
 
05:19:21.548 --> 05:19:21.558 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
05:19:23.910 --> 05:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
pel I just want to ask for the record
 
05:19:25.868 --> 05:19:25.878 align:start position:0%
you're talking about students who
 
05:19:28.390 --> 05:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
are um experiencing change of Duty
 
05:19:30.830 --> 05:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
station pretty frequently every 2 3
 
05:19:33.350 --> 05:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
years sometimes more often so the
 
05:19:35.628 --> 05:19:35.638 align:start position:0%
continuity of their educational care if
 
05:19:37.430 --> 05:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
you will is really of the utmost
 
05:19:39.830 --> 05:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
importance in these situations is that
 
05:19:43.070 --> 05:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct on average um PCS
 
05:19:44.948 --> 05:19:44.958 align:start position:0%
those permanent change of station moves
 
05:19:47.390 --> 05:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
occur every two to three years but there
 
05:19:49.628 --> 05:19:49.638 align:start position:0%
are some instances where a military uh
 
05:19:52.390 --> 05:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
service members are relocating every 9
 
05:19:54.270 --> 05:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
to 12 months depending on their military
 
05:19:56.628 --> 05:19:56.638 align:start position:0%
occupational specialty and if they do
 
05:19:59.390 --> 05:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
have a child with um a learning
 
05:20:02.430 --> 05:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
disability um that becomes problematic
 
05:20:06.830 --> 05:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
for the child uh in their continuity in
 
05:20:08.948 --> 05:20:08.958 align:start position:0%
education further questions represent
 
05:20:11.110 --> 05:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:20:14.350 --> 05:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
for being here uh I am familiar with the
 
05:20:17.310 --> 05:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
dod schools and I've been had the
 
05:20:20.030 --> 05:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
pleasure of being with teachers in
 
05:20:20.040 --> 05:20:21.270 align:start position:0%
pleasure of being with teachers in
Germany

05:20:21.270 --> 05:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
Germany
 
05:20:26.350 --> 05:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
England uh Korea and Japan and uh they
 
05:20:28.910 --> 05:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
provide one heck of an education for
 
05:20:31.590 --> 05:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
those kids and I comp compliment them
 
05:20:33.548 --> 05:20:33.558 align:start position:0%
for the work they do for the one of the
 
05:20:35.230 --> 05:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
things they've always have said that
 
05:20:37.230 --> 05:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
it's great teaching there because they
 
05:20:39.270 --> 05:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
have no discipline
 
05:20:41.190 --> 05:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
problems because of the discipline
 
05:20:42.910 --> 05:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
problem nobody wants to go to the
 
05:20:44.868 --> 05:20:44.878 align:start position:0%
Commanding General there and have their
 
05:20:46.990 --> 05:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
child there so it's nice but anyway on
 
05:20:49.830 --> 05:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
this point so this is an interesting
 
05:20:53.830 --> 05:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
issue so if if for example if I'm if I
 
05:20:56.948 --> 05:20:56.958 align:start position:0%
live in uh Portsmith for example and I'm
 
05:21:00.628 --> 05:21:00.638 align:start position:0%
deployed to vpot in Germany and I have a
 
05:21:00.638 --> 05:21:01.868 align:start position:0%
deployed to vpot in Germany and I have a
child

05:21:01.868 --> 05:21:01.878 align:start position:0%
child
 
05:21:05.708 --> 05:21:05.718 align:start position:0%
who uh my residence is in uh pouth but
 
05:21:08.470 --> 05:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
I'm deployed for a period of time let's
 
05:21:10.510 --> 05:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
say a couple years to vpot in Germany
 
05:21:12.548 --> 05:21:12.558 align:start position:0%
and I have a special ed
 
05:21:15.270 --> 05:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
child is the Portsmouth School District
 
05:21:15.280 --> 05:21:16.390 align:start position:0%
child is the Portsmouth School District
then

05:21:16.390 --> 05:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:21:20.070 --> 05:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for the special ed services
 
05:21:22.708 --> 05:21:22.718 align:start position:0%
in that facility in
 
05:21:27.110 --> 05:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
vpot the parent of the student would be
 
05:21:30.430 --> 05:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for providing that IEP or
 
05:21:33.590 --> 05:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
that paperwork work to the doia school
 
05:21:37.990 --> 05:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
in Germany okay so then if I have a
 
05:21:41.470 --> 05:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
dispute with uh whatever the services
 
05:21:44.510 --> 05:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
might be and it's the dispute obviously
 
05:21:46.430 --> 05:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
is going to be with the Portsmouth
 
05:21:49.190 --> 05:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
School District I'm now looking at the
 
05:21:52.868 --> 05:21:52.878 align:start position:0%
specific language of the of the bill
 
05:21:55.190 --> 05:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
here where it says witness fees encourag
 
05:21:56.230 --> 05:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
by the
 
05:22:01.070 --> 05:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
parents so and if if if I Prevail in my
 
05:22:03.910 --> 05:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
concern about that does that mean that
 
05:22:06.628 --> 05:22:06.638 align:start position:0%
the school district would pay for
 
05:22:09.708 --> 05:22:09.718 align:start position:0%
whatever witnesses that I bring to that
 
05:22:13.510 --> 05:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
particular uh that particular hearing if
 
05:22:16.030 --> 05:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
it was the DOA school um that you were
 
05:22:17.830 --> 05:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
going through the due process hearings
 
05:22:19.868 --> 05:22:19.878 align:start position:0%
with it would be the DOA school that
 
05:22:22.628 --> 05:22:22.638 align:start position:0%
would pay for those witness fees if it
 
05:22:24.868 --> 05:22:24.878 align:start position:0%
was the Portsmith school um that you
 
05:22:26.470 --> 05:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
went through that due process hearing
 
05:22:30.350 --> 05:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
with and they found in favor of you um
 
05:22:33.230 --> 05:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
they would pay for the witness fees
 
05:22:35.948 --> 05:22:35.958 align:start position:0%
according to this policy okay thank you
 
05:22:37.590 --> 05:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
you're welcome further further questions
 
05:22:39.030 --> 05:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
from the
 
05:22:41.310 --> 05:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
committee not see thank you very much
 
05:22:44.150 --> 05:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr uh Warren is it good time
 
05:22:49.390 --> 05:22:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:52.948 --> 05:22:52.958 align:start position:0%
you he's testified here
 
05:22:55.788 --> 05:22:55.798 align:start position:0%
before so Mr chair uh members of the
 
05:22:56.948 --> 05:22:56.958 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
05:22:58.548 --> 05:22:58.558 align:start position:0%
Warren Perry I'm the deputy agitant
 
05:22:59.708 --> 05:22:59.718 align:start position:0%
general for New Hampshire's Department
 
05:23:01.070 --> 05:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
of military Affairs and veterans
 
05:23:03.430 --> 05:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
Services uh that includes the National
 
05:23:05.470 --> 05:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
Guard of New Hampshire the division of
 
05:23:06.708 --> 05:23:06.718 align:start position:0%
veteran services the division of
 
05:23:08.910 --> 05:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
community- based military programs and
 
05:23:11.788 --> 05:23:11.798 align:start position:0%
the Veteran Cemetery uh we we are
 
05:23:13.830 --> 05:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
charged to take care of the veteran
 
05:23:15.628 --> 05:23:15.638 align:start position:0%
population in the state and all of the
 
05:23:18.910 --> 05:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
service members uh veterans and their
 
05:23:20.788 --> 05:23:20.798 align:start position:0%
families in the state so this kind of
 
05:23:22.990 --> 05:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
falls into our purview of something that
 
05:23:26.110 --> 05:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
we wanted to to uh to support the
 
05:23:28.708 --> 05:23:28.718 align:start position:0%
department supports the bill as written
 
05:23:30.628 --> 05:23:30.638 align:start position:0%
without having looked at the compact to
 
05:23:32.548 --> 05:23:32.558 align:start position:0%
see if it was duplicative so I'll just
 
05:23:35.270 --> 05:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
you helped us do that I I well I didn't
 
05:23:37.868 --> 05:23:37.878 align:start position:0%
but Carol protzman did Carol protzman
 
05:23:39.590 --> 05:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
did yes absolutely and she was wonderful
 
05:23:41.270 --> 05:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
when that got done at the time I was
 
05:23:42.750 --> 05:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
still on active duty I wasn't working
 
05:23:44.510 --> 05:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
for the state at that time I was the
 
05:23:45.948 --> 05:23:45.958 align:start position:0%
Inspector General for the state here at
 
05:23:50.150 --> 05:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
that time but uh so what I would say is
 
05:23:52.230 --> 05:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
that the timing of this is really kind
 
05:23:54.390 --> 05:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
of the key uh the key piece right so to
 
05:23:55.910 --> 05:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that that we don't have a lag
 
05:23:58.708 --> 05:23:58.718 align:start position:0%
in Services uh for military children
 
05:24:00.310 --> 05:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
that are moving I know that I don't have
 
05:24:03.470 --> 05:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
children that have IEPs or had special
 
05:24:06.910 --> 05:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
education needs but you know more than
 
05:24:10.070 --> 05:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
once in my 28 year military career my
 
05:24:12.150 --> 05:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
children were in at least three
 
05:24:16.110 --> 05:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
classrooms in one year so the continuity
 
05:24:18.430 --> 05:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
of that care is important and the timing
 
05:24:20.750 --> 05:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
by which that's delivered the continuity
 
05:24:22.750 --> 05:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
of that care is really important so if
 
05:24:25.590 --> 05:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
we're not getting timely resources to
 
05:24:27.590 --> 05:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
the to the children and their families
 
05:24:29.788 --> 05:24:29.798 align:start position:0%
as we go forward to me that's really the
 
05:24:32.310 --> 05:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh the issue that's that's critical here
 
05:24:35.110 --> 05:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
so if if this bill is duplicative I
 
05:24:36.910 --> 05:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
would just ask you know that the
 
05:24:38.830 --> 05:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
committee consider looking going back
 
05:24:40.510 --> 05:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
and doing a deeper dive into the into
 
05:24:42.390 --> 05:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
the compact which I will when I leave
 
05:24:44.390 --> 05:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
the committee today to make sure that
 
05:24:46.470 --> 05:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
those time Horizons are there so that
 
05:24:48.788 --> 05:24:48.798 align:start position:0%
we're not losing getting to 60 days
 
05:24:50.670 --> 05:24:50.680 align:start position:0%
without Services 60 days without a good
 
05:24:52.788 --> 05:24:52.798 align:start position:0%
IEP going you know we're getting
 
05:24:54.510 --> 05:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
somebody into the school system getting
 
05:24:57.310 --> 05:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
them access to the to the resources that
 
05:24:59.990 --> 05:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
they need to have good continuity of
 
05:25:01.868 --> 05:25:01.878 align:start position:0%
Education educational resources that
 
05:25:03.670 --> 05:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
they go so subject to any questions you
 
05:25:05.270 --> 05:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
might have that's the end of my St thank
 
05:25:06.390 --> 05:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions from the
 
05:25:09.350 --> 05:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
committee yes rep Tanner thank you and
 
05:25:12.350 --> 05:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your service um is this uh
 
05:25:14.910 --> 05:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
just active duty or is it also veterans
 
05:25:17.150 --> 05:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
so this this bill way it's written
 
05:25:19.230 --> 05:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
applies to Children of active duty
 
05:25:21.190 --> 05:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
service members so in the state of New
 
05:25:22.750 --> 05:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we think that population is
 
05:25:24.910 --> 05:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 11 and 1200 active
 
05:25:27.470 --> 05:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
duty service members and of that we
 
05:25:29.948 --> 05:25:29.958 align:start position:0%
believe there are about 800 children
 
05:25:31.708 --> 05:25:31.718 align:start position:0%
some of which will be school age
 
05:25:32.948 --> 05:25:32.958 align:start position:0%
children it's not all of them
 
05:25:34.750 --> 05:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily will be school age children
 
05:25:37.708 --> 05:25:37.718 align:start position:0%
if that helps further question yes
 
05:25:39.110 --> 05:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative Cornel thank you and
 
05:25:40.548 --> 05:25:40.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for your service and taking my
 
05:25:42.868 --> 05:25:42.878 align:start position:0%
question have has this been a problem in
 
05:25:45.110 --> 05:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or or is this legislation
 
05:25:48.470 --> 05:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
to just make sure that it's prepared I
 
05:25:50.590 --> 05:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
can't I can't speak to that I don't I
 
05:25:52.230 --> 05:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
don't really get into the education
 
05:25:54.350 --> 05:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
pieces of things I would tell you that
 
05:25:57.030 --> 05:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
we would generally probably not hear in
 
05:25:58.948 --> 05:25:58.958 align:start position:0%
my department that it was a problem
 
05:26:00.788 --> 05:26:00.798 align:start position:0%
unless it was a real chronic problem
 
05:26:01.990 --> 05:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
Like Somebody went to the Department of
 
05:26:03.708 --> 05:26:03.718 align:start position:0%
Education and they didn't get the
 
05:26:05.030 --> 05:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
satisfaction that they were looking for
 
05:26:06.350 --> 05:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
then they'd start looking for somebody
 
05:26:09.350 --> 05:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
else to call we don't hear that kind of
 
05:26:12.230 --> 05:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
noise if I can use that term in our
 
05:26:16.150 --> 05:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
department but I you know it I would say
 
05:26:17.750 --> 05:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
that just because we're not hearing it
 
05:26:19.750 --> 05:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it's not happening and just
 
05:26:21.390 --> 05:26:21.400 align:start position:0%
because we're not hearing it doesn't
 
05:26:23.310 --> 05:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
mean that it is happening so I think the
 
05:26:24.628 --> 05:26:24.638 align:start position:0%
Department of Education would have a
 
05:26:27.390 --> 05:26:27.400 align:start position:0%
better feel for that I will tell you
 
05:26:29.990 --> 05:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
from my experience most of the school
 
05:26:32.230 --> 05:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
districts in New Hampshire would not
 
05:26:36.628 --> 05:26:36.638 align:start position:0%
have the same sensitivity to this issue
 
05:26:39.390 --> 05:26:39.400 align:start position:0%
because they there's not a big military
 
05:26:41.548 --> 05:26:41.558 align:start position:0%
population in any one school district in
 
05:26:43.750 --> 05:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so like if you were
 
05:26:45.990 --> 05:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
outside of Fort cavaso which used to be
 
05:26:49.430 --> 05:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
Fort Hood uh you know every kid that
 
05:26:51.548 --> 05:26:51.558 align:start position:0%
comes in is a military child and they
 
05:26:54.190 --> 05:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
would have that experience here I think
 
05:26:55.470 --> 05:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
would I think the school districts would
 
05:26:57.390 --> 05:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
be more sensitive there's less turnover
 
05:26:59.470 --> 05:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
less churn you know on a military
 
05:27:01.548 --> 05:27:01.558 align:start position:0%
installation oneir of the installation
 
05:27:05.350 --> 05:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
turns over every year onethird so I
 
05:27:08.030 --> 05:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a huge problem but it
 
05:27:09.590 --> 05:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
certainly would be good to make sure
 
05:27:11.548 --> 05:27:11.558 align:start position:0%
that if there was people would have a
 
05:27:13.110 --> 05:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
standard that they could go to a time
 
05:27:14.750 --> 05:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
standard that they could go to whether
 
05:27:16.948 --> 05:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
that's in the compact or this
 
05:27:19.390 --> 05:27:19.400 align:start position:0%
legislation I don't I think that answers
 
05:27:21.230 --> 05:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
your question are there any further
 
05:27:22.868 --> 05:27:22.878 align:start position:0%
questions this whole thing just amazes
 
05:27:24.708 --> 05:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
me you know I live right outside
 
05:27:27.990 --> 05:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
Elmendorf and Richard up in Anchorage
 
05:27:29.910 --> 05:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
and there we had a higher percentage of
 
05:27:32.390 --> 05:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
turnover which were military
 
05:27:35.390 --> 05:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
yes I ap's transferred back and forth
 
05:27:37.628 --> 05:27:37.638 align:start position:0%
just you know without a question and if
 
05:27:39.270 --> 05:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
there is a problem here because I was
 
05:27:41.830 --> 05:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
under under the understanding that this
 
05:27:43.990 --> 05:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
was occurring that we were do due to
 
05:27:47.030 --> 05:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
that compact yeah kids should not have
 
05:27:49.030 --> 05:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
to wait they're they're the IEP
 
05:27:50.670 --> 05:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
transfers with them and they're good to
 
05:27:53.590 --> 05:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
go with that IEP yes there should not be
 
05:27:56.910 --> 05:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
any delay at all that's wonderful and
 
05:27:58.628 --> 05:27:58.638 align:start position:0%
encouraging to hear and and I and I know
 
05:28:00.830 --> 05:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
you representative you have you know
 
05:28:02.470 --> 05:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
your finger on this more than we do at
 
05:28:06.270 --> 05:28:06.280 align:start position:0%
the department I I'm just you know I'm
 
05:28:09.750 --> 05:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know stating our our support for the
 
05:28:11.270 --> 05:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
the outcome that this bill is trying to
 
05:28:12.948 --> 05:28:12.958 align:start position:0%
do and if it's being met in the compact
 
05:28:14.430 --> 05:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
we'll be happy with that if it's not
 
05:28:16.310 --> 05:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
being C if it's not being met in the in
 
05:28:17.788 --> 05:28:17.798 align:start position:0%
the compact we should probably go look
 
05:28:20.310 --> 05:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
and see that it is thank you very much
 
05:28:29.390 --> 05:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:29.400 --> 05:28:32.110 align:start position:0%
 
Grady

05:28:32.110 --> 05:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
Grady
 
05:28:33.430 --> 05:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman ladies and
 
05:28:34.990 --> 05:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
gentlemen of the committee I'll be I'll
 
05:28:36.830 --> 05:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
be fairly brief with my remarks today
 
05:28:39.110 --> 05:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Kevin Grady I
 
05:28:41.110 --> 05:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
am a 25y year veteran of our air force
 
05:28:43.590 --> 05:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm a 25 year resident of the town
 
05:28:45.670 --> 05:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
of hooks at New Hampshire today I'm here
 
05:28:47.548 --> 05:28:47.558 align:start position:0%
representing the state veterans advisory
 
05:28:50.750 --> 05:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
committee which are we are 20 veteran
 
05:28:52.670 --> 05:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
service organizations in the state their
 
05:28:54.390 --> 05:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
names would be familiar to you things
 
05:28:57.070 --> 05:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
like the VFW the American Legion
 
05:28:59.628 --> 05:28:59.638 align:start position:0%
representatives from all of the services
 
05:29:02.868 --> 05:29:02.878 align:start position:0%
Association if you will and we're
 
05:29:07.270 --> 05:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
chartered by state RSA 115 colon a-8 if
 
05:29:09.110 --> 05:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
you want to look it up to speak for the
 
05:29:10.510 --> 05:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
veteran community in New Hampshire and
 
05:29:11.830 --> 05:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we do we have a
 
05:29:14.470 --> 05:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
legislative committee which I chair and
 
05:29:16.030 --> 05:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
we look at the bills that are coming
 
05:29:18.948 --> 05:29:18.958 align:start position:0%
before the legislature each year and
 
05:29:20.948 --> 05:29:20.958 align:start position:0%
this year there are 20 of them and we
 
05:29:22.350 --> 05:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
separate out the ones that have the
 
05:29:24.190 --> 05:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
military impact and then we come and
 
05:29:27.070 --> 05:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
tell you what our opinion is uh like uh
 
05:29:29.350 --> 05:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
Deputy adant General Perry we do support
 
05:29:32.590 --> 05:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
the conception this this idea of making
 
05:29:34.470 --> 05:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
sure that this is good again the
 
05:29:36.190 --> 05:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
specific language if it's better done in
 
05:29:37.990 --> 05:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
the compact or maybe just a little tweak
 
05:29:41.310 --> 05:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
to the compact is necessary that's great
 
05:29:43.548 --> 05:29:43.558 align:start position:0%
um we think it's very important for that
 
05:29:45.948 --> 05:29:45.958 align:start position:0%
continuity of instru of of of
 
05:29:47.990 --> 05:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
instruction for a student particularly
 
05:29:53.350 --> 05:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
with an IEP now in my post a force life
 
05:29:56.030 --> 05:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
I did spend uh 11 years as a school
 
05:29:59.830 --> 05:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
teacher in uh in Hudson New Hampshire I
 
05:30:01.350 --> 05:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
represented leas I started the Air Force
 
05:30:03.310 --> 05:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
Junior r2c program at alurn back in the
 
05:30:06.350 --> 05:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
day back in ' 04 and I've attended my
 
05:30:08.990 --> 05:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
share of IEP meetings and I I've had
 
05:30:11.830 --> 05:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
probably 10 to 15% of my students had
 
05:30:14.070 --> 05:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
IEPs and I understand the critical
 
05:30:16.430 --> 05:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
importance of all of this as I reflected
 
05:30:18.830 --> 05:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
on my own military career I moved nine
 
05:30:21.150 --> 05:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
times three of those were in the summer
 
05:30:23.548 --> 05:30:23.558 align:start position:0%
the other six times were off cycle
 
05:30:27.430 --> 05:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
November December January February so
 
05:30:29.390 --> 05:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
times when it would have been difficult
 
05:30:31.788 --> 05:30:31.798 align:start position:0%
if ID had a child with an IEP which
 
05:30:33.830 --> 05:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
fortunately I did not that that could
 
05:30:36.510 --> 05:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
have been a a a significant issue we
 
05:30:38.430 --> 05:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
want for the students to be able to get
 
05:30:41.708 --> 05:30:41.718 align:start position:0%
in quickly get their IEP from their
 
05:30:45.910 --> 05:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
previous uh School implemented if if our
 
05:30:48.590 --> 05:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
folks can do a better job with it that's
 
05:30:50.230 --> 05:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
a wonderful thing we really like that
 
05:30:51.990 --> 05:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
idea maybe maybe we have access to
 
05:30:53.310 --> 05:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
Services here in New Hampshire that they
 
05:30:54.910 --> 05:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
didn't at their last Duty station for
 
05:30:57.788 --> 05:30:57.798 align:start position:0%
whatever reason so we love that idea and
 
05:30:59.110 --> 05:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
I think if we do the first part of this
 
05:31:01.470 --> 05:31:01.480 align:start position:0%
thing right then the second part with
 
05:31:04.110 --> 05:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
the with the uh you know getting fees if
 
05:31:05.510 --> 05:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
this has to go to court that stuff's
 
05:31:06.910 --> 05:31:06.920 align:start position:0%
never going to be a factor it's just
 
05:31:08.628 --> 05:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
going to be done correctly the first
 
05:31:10.350 --> 05:31:10.360 align:start position:0%
time the last thing and we've done a
 
05:31:12.430 --> 05:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
great job of this in our state I believe
 
05:31:14.590 --> 05:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
of uh of making people feel welcome you
 
05:31:15.788 --> 05:31:15.798 align:start position:0%
know we're we're NE we're trying to
 
05:31:17.750 --> 05:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
recruit the next group of people that
 
05:31:19.150 --> 05:31:19.160 align:start position:0%
are going to come and make their life in
 
05:31:20.350 --> 05:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire when they get out of the
 
05:31:22.190 --> 05:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
military and be part of our community
 
05:31:25.070 --> 05:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
and raise their families here so uh I we
 
05:31:26.788 --> 05:31:26.798 align:start position:0%
F fully support this bill and subject to
 
05:31:28.788 --> 05:31:28.798 align:start position:0%

the opportunity to testify um this
 
05:31:59.150 --> 05:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is Jane Bon bullu I'm
 
05:32:00.750 --> 05:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
the executive director for the New
 
05:32:02.830 --> 05:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of special ed
 
05:32:04.590 --> 05:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
administrators and I am here
 
05:32:07.590 --> 05:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
representing um over 270 leaders in the
 
05:32:09.030 --> 05:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
field of special
 
05:32:12.030 --> 05:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
education um I am here representing our
 
05:32:14.270 --> 05:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
members we're not taking a stance on the
 
05:32:16.628 --> 05:32:16.638 align:start position:0%
bill either Pro or con but just wanted
 
05:32:19.948 --> 05:32:19.958 align:start position:0%
to bring um some thoughts to your
 
05:32:23.190 --> 05:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
attention for consideration first of all
 
05:32:25.910 --> 05:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
um our Association members wanted me to
 
05:32:28.708 --> 05:32:28.718 align:start position:0%
share that we recognize and agree that
 
05:32:30.910 --> 05:32:30.920 align:start position:0%
there is such an importance in
 
05:32:32.990 --> 05:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
supporting our military families
 
05:32:35.628 --> 05:32:35.638 align:start position:0%
especially those that have students with
 
05:32:39.070 --> 05:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
IEPs um we find that you know when
 
05:32:40.788 --> 05:32:40.798 align:start position:0%
military families come in we need to
 
05:32:43.390 --> 05:32:43.400 align:start position:0%
give them the extra support um and
 
05:32:45.310 --> 05:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
transitions are hard for kids especially
 
05:32:49.030 --> 05:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
kids with um individual um education
 
05:32:51.470 --> 05:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
plans when we looked at the bill um
 
05:32:53.470 --> 05:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
there were a few things that we um
 
05:32:55.750 --> 05:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
thought about and the first one is
 
05:32:58.190 --> 05:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
around the enrollment of students um
 
05:33:00.350 --> 05:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
with IEPs when they come in to our
 
05:33:03.150 --> 05:33:03.160 align:start position:0%
schools and currently there are very
 
05:33:05.230 --> 05:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
specific guidelines that we have to
 
05:33:06.910 --> 05:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
adhere to in the field of special
 
05:33:09.230 --> 05:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
education when a child enrolls we have
 
05:33:12.270 --> 05:33:12.280 align:start position:0%
30 days to meet convene with the team
 
05:33:15.230 --> 05:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
which includes the family review the IEP
 
05:33:17.788 --> 05:33:17.798 align:start position:0%
and updated and make sure that the
 
05:33:22.948 --> 05:33:22.958 align:start position:0%
student um IEP is implemented um in in
 
05:33:25.150 --> 05:33:25.160 align:start position:0%
previous testimony we talked about the
 
05:33:28.708 --> 05:33:28.718 align:start position:0%
interstate uh compact um and I'm a part
 
05:33:30.750 --> 05:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
of that we meet regular ly and it
 
05:33:34.230 --> 05:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
includes um folks uh superintendents um
 
05:33:37.390 --> 05:33:37.400 align:start position:0%
Kathleen Murphy it was appointed as the
 
05:33:39.830 --> 05:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
um Point person for that group we have
 
05:33:41.948 --> 05:33:41.958 align:start position:0%
um folks from the Portsmith Naval
 
05:33:44.750 --> 05:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
Shipyard uh we have Educators we have
 
05:33:47.670 --> 05:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
parents um and and this issue hasn't
 
05:33:50.470 --> 05:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
really come up um and it was my
 
05:33:51.830 --> 05:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
understanding that these kinds of things
 
05:33:55.230 --> 05:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
were um covered under the compact so
 
05:33:56.910 --> 05:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
kind of took us by surprise and if there
 
05:33:58.868 --> 05:33:58.878 align:start position:0%
are things that aren't working um our
 
05:34:00.310 --> 05:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
association would love to know about it
 
05:34:01.910 --> 05:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
so that we can begin to work with our
 
05:34:05.230 --> 05:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
members and school districts um to begin
 
05:34:07.270 --> 05:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
um addressing any challenges that we're
 
05:34:10.110 --> 05:34:10.120 align:start position:0%
not aware of um the other thing that we
 
05:34:12.390 --> 05:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
would mention that um in this bill in
 
05:34:14.390 --> 05:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
terms of the language um throughout the
 
05:34:18.230 --> 05:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
bill it refers to an IEP evaluation that
 
05:34:20.310 --> 05:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
when a child moved in um the school
 
05:34:22.750 --> 05:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
district would be required to do an IEP
 
05:34:25.628 --> 05:34:25.638 align:start position:0%
evaluation and we question that language
 
05:34:26.948 --> 05:34:26.958 align:start position:0%
um the term
 
05:34:29.990 --> 05:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation typically lends itself to um
 
05:34:32.430 --> 05:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
the assessment of a student and specific
 
05:34:35.110 --> 05:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
tests that you have to give uh to
 
05:34:38.070 --> 05:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
students to become identified um as a
 
05:34:40.990 --> 05:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
student with a disability um or it means
 
05:34:43.510 --> 05:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
an evaluation to assess a student so
 
05:34:45.470 --> 05:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
typically when an IEP comes in it's not
 
05:34:48.548 --> 05:34:48.558 align:start position:0%
evaluated it's reviewed by the team uh
 
05:34:50.548 --> 05:34:50.558 align:start position:0%
to determine the appropriateness and how
 
05:34:53.270 --> 05:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to go about um implementing
 
05:34:55.830 --> 05:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
the services so that was also brought to
 
05:34:58.470 --> 05:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
our attention um other than that like I
 
05:35:01.150 --> 05:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
said we we also question the fiscal note
 
05:35:04.390 --> 05:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
um in terms of um you know paying the
 
05:35:07.030 --> 05:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
fees and wondered where that money was
 
05:35:11.470 --> 05:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
going to to come from um and so those
 
05:35:13.470 --> 05:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
were the comments that um our
 
05:35:16.070 --> 05:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
association uh asked me to bring forward
 
05:35:19.110 --> 05:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
05:35:21.510 --> 05:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
and we' be happy to take any questions
 
05:35:24.548 --> 05:35:24.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
05:35:27.590 --> 05:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative cordelli um
 
05:35:29.430 --> 05:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
yes regarding height thank thanks for
 
05:35:32.470 --> 05:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
sticking around um in regard to comments
 
05:35:33.470 --> 05:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
about an
 
05:35:36.868 --> 05:35:36.878 align:start position:0%
evaluation um wouldn't you think though
 
05:35:40.510 --> 05:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
that um uh military family transferring
 
05:35:45.270 --> 05:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
from overseas someplace uh for instance
 
05:35:48.868 --> 05:35:48.878 align:start position:0%
um it might be
 
05:35:51.830 --> 05:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
necessary for an evaluation regarding
 
05:35:54.788 --> 05:35:54.798 align:start position:0%
the IEP that they're bringing with them
 
05:35:56.590 --> 05:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
um after all they're coming you know
 
05:35:58.788 --> 05:35:58.798 align:start position:0%
from a military base granted from in a
 
05:36:01.110 --> 05:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
foreign country but still in a foreign
 
05:36:03.948 --> 05:36:03.958 align:start position:0%
country not knowing um you know
 
05:36:05.948 --> 05:36:05.958 align:start position:0%
everything that's available to them
 
05:36:09.110 --> 05:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
there um wouldn't you think that an
 
05:36:12.390 --> 05:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
evaluation would be um the best course
 
05:36:12.400 --> 05:36:13.430 align:start position:0%
evaluation would be um the best course
of

05:36:13.430 --> 05:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:36:15.868 --> 05:36:15.878 align:start position:0%
action yeah I mean I think we're just
 
05:36:18.510 --> 05:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
questioning the the language we're
 
05:36:21.708 --> 05:36:21.718 align:start position:0%
required by law to do a 30-day review of
 
05:36:23.868 --> 05:36:23.878 align:start position:0%
an IEP when the student moves in I mean
 
05:36:25.390 --> 05:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
they have the the school district you
 
05:36:28.670 --> 05:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
know is held to that timeline um it just
 
05:36:30.868 --> 05:36:30.878 align:start position:0%
was questionable we wouldn't want to put
 
05:36:32.788 --> 05:36:32.798 align:start position:0%
a student through another set of
 
05:36:36.030 --> 05:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
evaluations if they didn't need it so
 
05:36:37.708 --> 05:36:37.718 align:start position:0%
that the language was just a bit
 
05:36:39.750 --> 05:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
confusing and probably should align with
 
05:36:41.948 --> 05:36:41.958 align:start position:0%
current special education
 
05:36:46.270 --> 05:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
rules thank you further question
 
05:36:50.628 --> 05:36:50.638 align:start position:0%
represent so then should that be uh
 
05:36:53.430 --> 05:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
review as opposed to evaluation or what
 
05:36:55.310 --> 05:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting I think we would
 
05:36:57.470 --> 05:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
suggest that we you know if the bill
 
05:36:59.310 --> 05:36:59.320 align:start position:0%
were to move forward that align with the
 
05:36:59.320 --> 05:37:00.190 align:start position:0%
were to move forward that align with the
current

05:37:00.190 --> 05:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
current
 
05:37:01.910 --> 05:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
um expectations within the special
 
05:37:05.070 --> 05:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
education rules and currently um when a
 
05:37:06.628 --> 05:37:06.638 align:start position:0%
child is enrolled doesn't matter if it's
 
05:37:09.548 --> 05:37:09.558 align:start position:0%
a military family or kid from another
 
05:37:13.070 --> 05:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
District um I the district is required
 
05:37:15.670 --> 05:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
to convene the IEP team and review that
 
05:37:18.868 --> 05:37:18.878 align:start position:0%
IEP within 30 days so there is specific
 
05:37:21.510 --> 05:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
language already okay and would you get
 
05:37:23.150 --> 05:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
that to us what that language is
 
05:37:25.390 --> 05:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
specifically thank you very much thank
 
05:37:27.310 --> 05:37:27.320 align:start position:0%
you any further questions
 
05:37:29.590 --> 05:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
from thank you very much you're welcome
 
05:37:32.270 --> 05:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
welcome I want to just ask everybody in
 
05:37:34.750 --> 05:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
the committee to read the compact in
 
05:37:37.190 --> 05:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
Article 5 because it talks about
 
05:37:40.750 --> 05:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
evaluations also it says this does not
 
05:37:42.230 --> 05:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
preclude the school in the receiving
 
05:37:43.948 --> 05:37:43.958 align:start position:0%
state from performing subsequent
 
05:37:46.350 --> 05:37:46.360 align:start position:0%
evaluation to ensure appropriate
 
05:37:48.590 --> 05:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
placement of the
 
05:37:51.948 --> 05:37:51.958 align:start position:0%
student now I I I you know I'm all for
 
05:37:53.788 --> 05:37:53.798 align:start position:0%
if it's not being done we got to do
 
05:37:53.798 --> 05:37:55.628 align:start position:0%
if it's not being done we got to do
something

05:37:55.628 --> 05:37:55.638 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:37:58.510 --> 05:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
but this is done this language right
 
05:38:01.830 --> 05:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
here replicated in all 50
 
05:38:04.788 --> 05:38:04.798 align:start position:0%
states so we're messing with a compact
 
05:38:08.110 --> 05:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm concern and there there this
 
05:38:10.750 --> 05:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
is this is a thorough compact it's a
 
05:38:12.990 --> 05:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
whole chapter of law so please read it
 
05:38:16.830 --> 05:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
over NE next um person and last person
 
05:38:21.430 --> 05:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:24.430 --> 05:38:24.440 align:start position:0%
Department um that particular article on
 
05:38:24.440 --> 05:38:26.548 align:start position:0%
Department um that particular article on
page

05:38:26.548 --> 05:38:26.558 align:start position:0%
page
 
05:38:29.150 --> 05:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
65 thank you representative vad my name
 
05:38:30.990 --> 05:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
is Rebeca fet I'm from the Department of
 
05:38:32.830 --> 05:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
Education I'm the director of special
 
05:38:35.510 --> 05:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
education um I I want we're not
 
05:38:37.190 --> 05:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
supporting or not supporting this we
 
05:38:38.548 --> 05:38:38.558 align:start position:0%
understand that military families have
 
05:38:39.910 --> 05:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
unique situations and we hope that
 
05:38:41.910 --> 05:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
anyone would um provide the services
 
05:38:44.948 --> 05:38:44.958 align:start position:0%
they need my um concern is just a
 
05:38:46.390 --> 05:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
technical one which was brought up by
 
05:38:49.070 --> 05:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
Jane berson with the evaluation piece um
 
05:38:50.910 --> 05:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
it's the language is unclear whether
 
05:38:52.590 --> 05:38:52.600 align:start position:0%
we're saying that an evaluation needs to
 
05:38:54.548 --> 05:38:54.558 align:start position:0%
be done within 30 days or if we just
 
05:38:57.590 --> 05:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
need to review the IEP within 30 days so
 
05:38:59.948 --> 05:38:59.958 align:start position:0%
if it's the IEP that make that's as she
 
05:39:01.670 --> 05:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
said that's already in law if it's the
 
05:39:04.350 --> 05:39:04.360 align:start position:0%
evaluation and then subsequently an IEP
 
05:39:06.708 --> 05:39:06.718 align:start position:0%
we're taking a 120-day process and doing
 
05:39:08.990 --> 05:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
it within 30 days so that would be my
 
05:39:10.510 --> 05:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
concern is if we have to and then if we
 
05:39:12.270 --> 05:39:12.280 align:start position:0%
have to evaluate every single child that
 
05:39:14.670 --> 05:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
comes in that's going to delay their
 
05:39:17.390 --> 05:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
services so I guess there needs to be a
 
05:39:19.708 --> 05:39:19.718 align:start position:0%
little Clarity for me to understand if
 
05:39:21.468 --> 05:39:21.478 align:start position:0%
I'm supporting districts and saying you
 
05:39:23.270 --> 05:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
do need to evaluate a child every time
 
05:39:25.590 --> 05:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
they come in from a military base or if
 
05:39:27.548 --> 05:39:27.558 align:start position:0%
I'm saying you need to review their IEP
 
05:39:29.150 --> 05:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
and meet as soon as possible once they
 
05:39:30.948 --> 05:39:30.958 align:start position:0%
come from from a military
 
05:39:34.030 --> 05:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
base thank you very much and to respond
 
05:39:36.670 --> 05:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
to that when we did this the intent was
 
05:39:41.150 --> 05:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
the IEP comes in is good and if the
 
05:39:44.030 --> 05:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
district discerns that there need to do
 
05:39:45.868 --> 05:39:45.878 align:start position:0%
something follow the procedure that's
 
05:39:49.750 --> 05:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
outlined in in idea and the laws and
 
05:39:52.708 --> 05:39:52.718 align:start position:0%
statutes you follow right so I think we
 
05:39:54.390 --> 05:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
have this thing covered I hope we have
 
05:39:56.030 --> 05:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
it covered because we had a long
 
05:39:58.430 --> 05:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
discussion on this article 5 when we
 
05:40:02.590 --> 05:40:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:06.830 --> 05:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:16.230 --> 05:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:22.910 --> 05:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:26.150 --> 05:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
yep so thank you Jessica vif
 
05:40:28.548 --> 05:40:28.558 align:start position:0%
representing myself but also
 
05:40:28.558 --> 05:40:29.910 align:start position:0%
representing myself but also
superintendent

05:40:29.910 --> 05:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
05:40:33.788 --> 05:40:33.798 align:start position:0%
SCH um I would just like to offer some
 
05:40:35.468 --> 05:40:35.478 align:start position:0%
consideration of language in here to
 
05:40:37.670 --> 05:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
reiterate what was previously brought up
 
05:40:40.110 --> 05:40:40.120 align:start position:0%
by a couple of people um it's really in
 
05:40:41.990 --> 05:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
the semantics of the language in here
 
05:40:45.350 --> 05:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm concerned about and curious
 
05:40:47.590 --> 05:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
it might be adjusted a little bit um
 
05:40:52.830 --> 05:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:55.990 --> 05:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
was the
 
05:40:58.708 --> 05:40:58.718 align:start position:0%
evaluation regarding the IEP shall be
 
05:41:02.350 --> 05:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
conducted 30 days so evaluation and I
 
05:41:03.628 --> 05:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
are two separate things within the
 
05:41:06.708 --> 05:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
specialized process and those two terms
 
05:41:09.350 --> 05:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
being put together are a confusing
 
05:41:13.070 --> 05:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
sentiment in so evaluation cannot be
 
05:41:15.868 --> 05:41:15.878 align:start position:0%
completed within 30 days that's a 90 up
 
05:41:18.788 --> 05:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
to 90day process um that the school
 
05:41:21.708 --> 05:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
district goes through with a student um
 
05:41:23.750 --> 05:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
schools are obligated when a student
 
05:41:26.150 --> 05:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
comes in with an IEP as soon as they
 
05:41:28.590 --> 05:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
learn that a child has an IEP they're
 
05:41:31.150 --> 05:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
obligated Implement that IEP immediately
 
05:41:33.708 --> 05:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
to their best ability as it currently
 
05:41:36.590 --> 05:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
stands then they have 30 days to review
 
05:41:39.230 --> 05:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
that IEP see what is the best interest
 
05:41:40.948 --> 05:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
of the child get feedback from the
 
05:41:43.070 --> 05:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
parent and then have that meeting to
 
05:41:46.468 --> 05:41:46.478 align:start position:0%
amend that IEP to accept it in um and
 
05:41:48.350 --> 05:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
determine if they're going to evaluate
 
05:41:50.510 --> 05:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
if the student moved across state lines
 
05:41:53.310 --> 05:41:53.320 align:start position:0%
or from another country uh the team has
 
05:41:55.350 --> 05:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
an obligation and a right to reevaluate
 
05:41:57.868 --> 05:41:57.878 align:start position:0%
that child if they feel like it's
 
05:42:00.430 --> 05:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
necessary um in the meantime while they
 
05:42:03.030 --> 05:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
make that decision they still have have
 
05:42:05.628 --> 05:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
to implement that current I to their
 
05:42:07.910 --> 05:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
best ability and to meet those Services
 
05:42:13.150 --> 05:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
needs within that I um the second part
 
05:42:14.750 --> 05:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to draw your attention to
 
05:42:20.628 --> 05:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
with lines 14 15 of the proposed bill to
 
05:42:22.708 --> 05:42:22.718 align:start position:0%
me I worri that it puts the onus on the
 
05:42:25.270 --> 05:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
parent alone Prov buide a copy of that I
 
05:42:29.990 --> 05:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
to the school um I I would with military
 
05:42:32.430 --> 05:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
family that might get difficult if they
 
05:42:35.190 --> 05:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
are moving frequently they may lose
 
05:42:36.948 --> 05:42:36.958 align:start position:0%
track of documents a little easier than
 
05:42:38.750 --> 05:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
some other families so I'm worry that
 
05:42:41.670 --> 05:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
that puts all the hus on military family
 
05:42:43.868 --> 05:42:43.878 align:start position:0%
to provide that document and not the
 
05:42:47.190 --> 05:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
school for which they are coming from so
 
05:42:48.948 --> 05:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
I maybe just encourage you to look at
 
05:42:51.670 --> 05:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
that language and maybe an and or in
 
05:42:54.868 --> 05:42:54.878 align:start position:0%
there um not just solely relying on that
 
05:42:58.070 --> 05:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
parent to provide a copy of that I
 
05:42:58.080 --> 05:43:00.190 align:start position:0%
parent to provide a copy of that I
to

05:43:00.190 --> 05:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:43:02.150 --> 05:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions from the
 
05:43:04.830 --> 05:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much and the
 
05:43:14.670 --> 05:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:18.070 --> 05:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
Ryan Mr chairman and education committee
 
05:43:21.708 --> 05:43:21.718 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to support this bill um for
 
05:43:23.350 --> 05:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
those of you that don't know I am US
 
05:43:26.110 --> 05:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
Army retired in 2018 and I support or
 
05:43:27.590 --> 05:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time supporting disabled
 
05:43:29.390 --> 05:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
veterans and Veterans I just just came
 
05:43:30.708 --> 05:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
back from Washington where I was
 
05:43:32.830 --> 05:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
approached by a higher up from DOD who
 
05:43:34.270 --> 05:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
said that there were a lot of complaints
 
05:43:35.628 --> 05:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
coming through the inspector General's
 
05:43:37.990 --> 05:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
office about IEPs and special education
 
05:43:41.390 --> 05:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
issues and he told me to get on that so
 
05:43:43.590 --> 05:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know how or why people think I
 
05:43:46.150 --> 05:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
can magically make things happen but I
 
05:43:49.030 --> 05:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
do support this bill I can say for sure
 
05:43:50.590 --> 05:43:50.600 align:start position:0%
there are some parents who choose to
 
05:43:53.390 --> 05:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
leave their kids in DOD EA schools and
 
05:43:56.788 --> 05:43:56.798 align:start position:0%
move other places um or bring their kids
 
05:43:58.590 --> 05:43:58.600 align:start position:0%
so I I have a friend who's in the Army
 
05:44:00.468 --> 05:44:00.478 align:start position:0%
who's ly stationed at Ford drum but his
 
05:44:03.430 --> 05:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
kids are here um and so they're playing
 
05:44:05.270 --> 05:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
different issues with moving around
 
05:44:07.030 --> 05:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
putting kids in different locations
 
05:44:09.110 --> 05:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
based off what's best for their kid we
 
05:44:10.750 --> 05:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
have what we call the Exceptional Family
 
05:44:14.270 --> 05:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
Member Program in the uh in the military
 
05:44:15.830 --> 05:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
which is supposed to try and support
 
05:44:18.070 --> 05:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
these family members but the onus really
 
05:44:19.788 --> 05:44:19.798 align:start position:0%
is on the family at most of the time to
 
05:44:21.230 --> 05:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
have the records to get the meetings to
 
05:44:24.628 --> 05:44:24.638 align:start position:0%
do the everything because we're the ones
 
05:44:26.868 --> 05:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
responsible at the end of the day so I
 
05:44:28.990 --> 05:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
do want to support this bill I was told
 
05:44:29.948 --> 05:44:29.958 align:start position:0%
that there were a number of complaints
 
05:44:31.190 --> 05:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
coming through the inspector General's
 
05:44:32.590 --> 05:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
office ours is one of the states that
 
05:44:35.070 --> 05:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
does not have an education Jag attorney
 
05:44:38.270 --> 05:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
um which I will work on trying to do uh
 
05:44:41.030 --> 05:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
but there has been I also was approached
 
05:44:42.708 --> 05:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
by someone who who was having some
 
05:44:44.548 --> 05:44:44.558 align:start position:0%
issues with her school district in just
 
05:44:46.070 --> 05:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
getting the IEP up and running felt like
 
05:44:47.628 --> 05:44:47.638 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of push back so I just
 
05:44:49.430 --> 05:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to let you know that this is
 
05:44:51.948 --> 05:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
affecting people um and people may not
 
05:44:53.390 --> 05:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
be aware of it because they don't think
 
05:44:54.788 --> 05:44:54.798 align:start position:0%
of oh yes this person might be a
 
05:44:57.468 --> 05:44:57.478 align:start position:0%
military or in my own town lenary we
 
05:44:59.670 --> 05:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
have a reserve base and the
 
05:45:00.868 --> 05:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
superintendent didn't even know there
 
05:45:02.190 --> 05:45:02.200 align:start position:0%
were military kids in the school and
 
05:45:05.430 --> 05:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
he'd w a propose star Grant so I do
 
05:45:07.350 --> 05:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
support this bill I do believe there may
 
05:45:08.788 --> 05:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
be some issues with the language but I
 
05:45:11.190 --> 05:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
hope you will consider passing it thank
 
05:45:14.350 --> 05:45:14.360 align:start position:0%
you any questions from the committee
 
05:45:17.350 --> 05:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair I have a
 
05:45:19.350 --> 05:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
question of you yeah as I look at this
 
05:45:23.270 --> 05:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
bill we've talked a lot about IEPs Etc
 
05:45:25.830 --> 05:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
but isn't the focus of this bill dealing
 
05:45:29.310 --> 05:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
with the U witness fees that the
 
05:45:31.628 --> 05:45:31.638 align:start position:0%
highlighted I mean this I mean this is
 
05:45:33.670 --> 05:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
the current language is here what we're
 
05:45:35.788 --> 05:45:35.798 align:start position:0%
what we're focused on is really the
 
05:45:37.548 --> 05:45:37.558 align:start position:0%
witness fees is that correct that's
 
05:45:40.310 --> 05:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
that's what is in this is that one is
 
05:45:43.310 --> 05:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
new the following new paragraph see at
 
05:45:45.830 --> 05:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
the top all right thank you and so what
 
05:45:47.788 --> 05:45:47.798 align:start position:0%
you need to do is look at this and then
 
05:45:50.628 --> 05:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
read that compact that's what we need to
 
05:45:53.910 --> 05:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
do in my suggesting is if we're going to
 
05:45:56.990 --> 05:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
do it too we should put it in one
 
05:46:00.430 --> 05:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
place you know the military have really
 
05:46:03.510 --> 05:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
came in on this Compact and there was a
 
05:46:06.070 --> 05:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion on this and we had
 
05:46:08.350 --> 05:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
folks coming in because at that time we
 
05:46:10.430 --> 05:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
had not just dot kids we had kids who
 
05:46:11.670 --> 05:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
were in The International Schools we
 
05:46:13.110 --> 05:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
also had folks which are not in the
 
05:46:16.670 --> 05:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
military that were working on DOD basis
 
05:46:20.190 --> 05:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
do a do Department of Defense basis DOD
 
05:46:23.350 --> 05:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
and moving just as much and you know
 
05:46:25.510 --> 05:46:25.520 align:start position:0%

Fort Hood Fort Dicks all those places
 
05:46:29.390 --> 05:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
are moving and
 
05:46:31.590 --> 05:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
it's important to me I thought we had it
 
05:46:33.350 --> 05:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
together and I'm going to look make sure
 
05:46:36.030 --> 05:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
that we do have this the way we want
 
05:46:40.590 --> 05:46:40.600 align:start position:0%

05:46:43.830 --> 05:46:43.840 align:start position:0%

05:47:30.270 --> 05:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
retention of individualized Education
 
05:47:33.548 --> 05:47:33.558 align:start position:0%
records um what the department is
 
05:47:36.150 --> 05:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
suggesting is to add paragraph
 
05:47:39.750 --> 05:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
three um so that they have the ability
 
05:47:45.430 --> 05:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
to actually in implement the law um that
 
05:47:48.708 --> 05:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
describes when records can be um
 
05:47:51.390 --> 05:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
destroyed and how long they need to be
 
05:47:54.830 --> 05:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
retained uh based on what the districts
 
05:47:57.350 --> 05:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
are what what what the districts have as
 
05:48:00.310 --> 05:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
a procedure every every district has the
 
05:48:01.548 --> 05:48:01.558 align:start position:0%
policy it's
 
05:48:05.510 --> 05:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
ehb on the process for special ed um
 
05:48:08.190 --> 05:48:08.200 align:start position:0%
records and upon High School
 
05:48:12.628 --> 05:48:12.638 align:start position:0%
graduation there is um a process that if
 
05:48:16.628 --> 05:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
a parent wants um a record destroyed
 
05:48:18.310 --> 05:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
they need to put it in writing I'll let
 
05:48:20.708 --> 05:48:20.718 align:start position:0%
them give you the specifics the timeline
 
05:48:25.150 --> 05:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
is you know up to age 26 and then um
 
05:48:27.468 --> 05:48:27.478 align:start position:0%
when the child reaches 30 uh then the
 
05:48:29.190 --> 05:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
records can be destroyed unless the
 
05:48:33.948 --> 05:48:33.958 align:start position:0%
parent requests not to so um that's
 
05:48:37.150 --> 05:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
available on any student on any school
 
05:48:39.788 --> 05:48:39.798 align:start position:0%
district website in terms of the process
 
05:48:43.990 --> 05:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
but for the bill um the law already has
 
05:48:46.910 --> 05:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
that 26th birthday and 30th
 
05:48:49.590 --> 05:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
birthday um in it and it's adding this
 
05:48:50.948 --> 05:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
paragraph three that says they're going
 
05:48:53.350 --> 05:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
to be on the same school schedule as the
 
05:48:53.360 --> 05:48:54.548 align:start position:0%
to be on the same school schedule as the
school

05:48:54.548 --> 05:48:54.558 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:48:54.558 --> 05:48:57.310 align:start position:0%
school
districts

05:48:57.310 --> 05:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
districts
 
05:49:00.270 --> 05:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
um and in terms of following federal law
 
05:49:02.190 --> 05:49:02.200 align:start position:0%
federal law does not impose any time
 
05:49:04.270 --> 05:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
limits on record
 
05:49:06.788 --> 05:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
retentions of special ed records any
 
05:49:09.430 --> 05:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
questions for represent
 
05:49:13.230 --> 05:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
cascaden superintendent
 
05:49:15.590 --> 05:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
cascaden representative
 
05:49:19.390 --> 05:49:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:26.590 --> 05:49:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:30.990 --> 05:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
Ryan that's yeah yep we got
 
05:49:34.910 --> 05:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
it yeah these are 1382 right here I just
 
05:49:37.390 --> 05:49:37.400 align:start position:0%
have a very quick Point um I just wanted
 
05:49:40.270 --> 05:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
to say that with these records um it's
 
05:49:42.110 --> 05:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
very important that they get retained
 
05:49:44.030 --> 05:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
because parents often find themselves in
 
05:49:46.110 --> 05:49:46.120 align:start position:0%
need of the records to prove something
 
05:49:48.468 --> 05:49:48.478 align:start position:0%
for their child whether it's hipic
 
05:49:52.350 --> 05:49:52.360 align:start position:0%
waivers ddu um so they do if if there
 
05:49:54.270 --> 05:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
are any changes made I would hope it
 
05:49:57.670 --> 05:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
would be to further and not diminish so
 
05:49:59.468 --> 05:49:59.478 align:start position:0%
that was the only point wanted to make
 
05:50:01.030 --> 05:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
05:50:03.468 --> 05:50:03.478 align:start position:0%
questions for Miss
 
05:50:08.150 --> 05:50:08.160 align:start position:0%

no record retention for us in regards to
 
05:50:24.070 --> 05:50:24.080 align:start position:0%

uh simple bill in in my mind anyway um I
 
06:02:00.110 --> 06:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
think earlier today we heard about a a
 
06:02:02.310 --> 06:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
federal statute called
 
06:02:07.990 --> 06:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
furpa and um if you want definition or
 
06:02:10.548 --> 06:02:10.558 align:start position:0%
anything it's uh on page 503 in your
 
06:02:13.670 --> 06:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
book uh f is the family educational
 
06:02:15.310 --> 06:02:15.320 align:start position:0%
rights and Privacy
 
06:02:20.070 --> 06:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
Act um and it comes into
 
06:02:22.948 --> 06:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
play um with this
 
06:02:27.070 --> 06:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
legislation um because furp is intended
 
06:02:30.110 --> 06:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
to protect student
 
06:02:32.990 --> 06:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
privacy however there is a section of
 
06:02:35.350 --> 06:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
furpa that I'd like to address and
 
06:02:37.510 --> 06:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's part of the handout that I sent
 
06:02:41.670 --> 06:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
around the um student guide to
 
06:02:43.910 --> 06:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
furpa um hopefully it got around to
 
06:02:46.948 --> 06:02:46.958 align:start position:0%
everybody but on page three in the
 
06:02:49.590 --> 06:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
section in the uh middle of the page
 
06:02:53.270 --> 06:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
there is a section um titled School
 
06:02:56.830 --> 06:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
official and in that section it says
 
06:02:59.670 --> 06:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
also under the school official except
 
06:03:02.390 --> 06:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
exception to the consent requirement the
 
06:03:05.590 --> 06:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
consent meaning a a parental consent to
 
06:03:08.788 --> 06:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
release student information private um
 
06:03:11.948 --> 06:03:11.958 align:start position:0%
uh Privacy Information protected
 
06:03:15.548 --> 06:03:15.558 align:start position:0%
information um furpa permits a school to
 
06:03:18.990 --> 06:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
disclose pii the private information
 
06:03:21.670 --> 06:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
from educa educational records to
 
06:03:21.680 --> 06:03:23.830 align:start position:0%
from educa educational records to
contractors

06:03:23.830 --> 06:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
06:03:26.868 --> 06:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
Consultants uh volunteers and another
 
06:03:29.830 --> 06:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
third parties to whom the school has
 
06:03:33.110 --> 06:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
outsourced institutional services or
 
06:03:36.270 --> 06:03:36.280 align:start position:0%
function provided the outside party and
 
06:03:39.590 --> 06:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
then it lists four criteria including
 
06:03:43.548 --> 06:03:43.558 align:start position:0%
that the outside um party is performing
 
06:03:45.948 --> 06:03:45.958 align:start position:0%
an Institutional service or
 
06:03:50.468 --> 06:03:50.478 align:start position:0%
function and this comes into play um
 
06:03:53.628 --> 06:03:53.638 align:start position:0%
particularly in the uh past few years
 
06:03:57.868 --> 06:03:57.878 align:start position:0%
under various programs um grant program
 
06:04:01.430 --> 06:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
to provide um health and mental health
 
06:04:05.110 --> 06:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
services um to uh students in our
 
06:04:08.830 --> 06:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
schools and um one of the um I can't
 
06:04:11.230 --> 06:04:11.240 align:start position:0%
remember the name of the grant but uh
 
06:04:15.628 --> 06:04:15.638 align:start position:0%
widely um used uh third party is the
 
06:04:17.990 --> 06:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
behavioral health Improvement Institute
 
06:04:21.628 --> 06:04:21.638 align:start position:0%
at Keen State College uh to perform
 
06:04:23.468 --> 06:04:23.478 align:start position:0%
these services for
 
06:04:27.150 --> 06:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
students um and that's allowed under
 
06:04:30.430 --> 06:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
furpa so you know I'm not going to take
 
06:04:34.548 --> 06:04:34.558 align:start position:0%
on furpa today um but what I do want to
 
06:04:37.708 --> 06:04:37.718 align:start position:0%
do is put forward this bill that
 
06:04:40.230 --> 06:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
indicates that
 
06:04:44.708 --> 06:04:44.718 align:start position:0%
if the information is given by a third
 
06:04:49.590 --> 06:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
party under furpa in accordance with
 
06:04:52.628 --> 06:04:52.638 align:start position:0%
furpa with the consent exception that I
 
06:04:55.110 --> 06:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
just talked about and you'll see it on
 
06:04:57.990 --> 06:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
lines 9 through 12
 
06:04:59.830 --> 06:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
if person if student personally
 
06:05:02.270 --> 06:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
identifiable data is released to a third
 
06:05:04.628 --> 06:05:04.638 align:start position:0%

06:05:08.230 --> 06:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
informed within School excuse me 14
 
06:05:10.390 --> 06:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
business school business days of the
 
06:05:13.670 --> 06:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
release to whom the data was released
 
06:05:16.230 --> 06:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
what information in Rel was released and
 
06:05:18.670 --> 06:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
the Ed educational purpose for which
 
06:05:20.590 --> 06:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
that information was
 
06:05:25.830 --> 06:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
released um I'm not quarreling with the
 
06:05:27.990 --> 06:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
06:05:30.110 --> 06:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
releasing of that information but I
 
06:05:33.070 --> 06:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
think the least we can do is let parents
 
06:05:36.590 --> 06:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
know that their students information is
 
06:05:39.750 --> 06:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
being released to whom and
 
06:05:43.750 --> 06:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
why um so that's all this bill does is
 
06:05:46.430 --> 06:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
to inform the parents about the release
 
06:05:49.070 --> 06:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
of information which is permissible
 
06:05:53.070 --> 06:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
under federal law um you know I I think
 
06:05:53.080 --> 06:05:54.030 align:start position:0%
under federal law um you know I I think
uh

06:05:54.030 --> 06:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:05:55.990 --> 06:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
transparency um is something that we
 
06:05:59.868 --> 06:05:59.878 align:start position:0%
need to pay attention to um we we've
 
06:06:03.070 --> 06:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
talked about uh today a number of times
 
06:06:06.548 --> 06:06:06.558 align:start position:0%
about parent engagement and um we've
 
06:06:08.910 --> 06:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
talked about parents rights and
 
06:06:11.510 --> 06:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
transparency I I think this is in line
 
06:06:14.190 --> 06:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
with those topics and the least we can
 
06:06:17.510 --> 06:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
do is to notify the parent if their
 
06:06:19.350 --> 06:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
students information is being released
 
06:06:22.390 --> 06:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
to a third party so thank you very much
 
06:06:23.788 --> 06:06:23.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
06:06:25.548 --> 06:06:25.558 align:start position:0%
questions for representa Cordell yes
 
06:06:27.110 --> 06:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden thank you than
 
06:06:29.070 --> 06:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh thank you for taking my
 
06:06:31.948 --> 06:06:31.958 align:start position:0%
question sure so does the new language
 
06:06:35.670 --> 06:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
um in this bill about personal identif
 
06:06:39.350 --> 06:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
pii does that negate the directory
 
06:06:41.830 --> 06:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
information in
 
06:06:45.750 --> 06:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
fura there directory information certain
 
06:06:48.548 --> 06:06:48.558 align:start position:0%
guidelines right without consent I mean
 
06:06:50.150 --> 06:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know why you would want to
 
06:06:53.190 --> 06:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
anyway but nonetheless F identifies that
 
06:06:56.350 --> 06:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
right right this is specifically related
 
06:06:57.628 --> 06:06:57.638 align:start position:0%
to the
 
06:06:57.638 --> 06:06:59.030 align:start position:0%
to the
uh

06:06:59.030 --> 06:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:07:01.150 --> 06:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
exception that they can release
 
06:07:02.948 --> 06:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
information to a third party without
 
06:07:06.150 --> 06:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
consent um I don't think it um is
 
06:07:08.390 --> 06:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
impacted by directory
 
06:07:12.948 --> 06:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
statutes this is um a narrow um uh
 
06:07:15.948 --> 06:07:15.958 align:start position:0%
exception that I'm trying to
 
06:07:19.150 --> 06:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
address further questions bson
 
06:07:22.110 --> 06:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
Heath just a quick question I remember I
 
06:07:25.030 --> 06:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
worked at the department so long ago and
 
06:07:28.430 --> 06:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
um we were doing the state assessment
 
06:07:31.548 --> 06:07:31.558 align:start position:0%
and um we went round and round and round
 
06:07:34.990 --> 06:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
with Neil Kirk about this very subject
 
06:07:39.548 --> 06:07:39.558 align:start position:0%
um what we had to do we had to um
 
06:07:41.788 --> 06:07:41.798 align:start position:0%
anybody who looked at the data had to
 
06:07:44.070 --> 06:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
sign a special release saying that they'
 
06:07:46.190 --> 06:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
never divulged the information to
 
06:07:50.628 --> 06:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
anybody um but the testing company they
 
06:07:53.628 --> 06:07:53.638 align:start position:0%
held the the information and there was
 
06:07:56.350 --> 06:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
uh we always had student identifiers and
 
06:07:57.788 --> 06:07:57.798 align:start position:0%
that's the only only thing that we used
 
06:08:01.788 --> 06:08:01.798 align:start position:0%
to work with um I I don't know of any
 
06:08:04.830 --> 06:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
instance when we release student
 
06:08:08.070 --> 06:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
information um I I think if I could I
 
06:08:10.590 --> 06:08:10.600 align:start position:0%
think answer your question I think um
 
06:08:13.030 --> 06:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
maybe three or four years ago we did
 
06:08:16.070 --> 06:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
pass legislation allowing some student
 
06:08:18.270 --> 06:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
information to be sent to the testing
 
06:08:21.030 --> 06:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
company so that they the testing company
 
06:08:23.910 --> 06:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
could send out the test scores to the
 
06:08:27.190 --> 06:08:27.200 align:start position:0%
students exactly yes um but I don't know
 
06:08:30.190 --> 06:08:30.200 align:start position:0%
I don't ever remember us
 
06:08:32.990 --> 06:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
giving student identification
 
06:08:36.070 --> 06:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
information to a third party other than
 
06:08:40.868 --> 06:08:40.878 align:start position:0%
the testing company right um under these
 
06:08:44.190 --> 06:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
um under some of these grants that are
 
06:08:47.110 --> 06:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
being made available and to third um
 
06:08:48.750 --> 06:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
third parties such as the one that I
 
06:08:51.390 --> 06:08:51.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned um that information is being
 
06:08:55.310 --> 06:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
available is being made available um and
 
06:08:57.350 --> 06:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's allowable
 
06:08:58.948 --> 06:08:58.958 align:start position:0%
I'm not quarreling with that it's just
 
06:09:01.030 --> 06:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
that I think parents should be
 
06:09:03.230 --> 06:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
notified um and I think there might be
 
06:09:06.750 --> 06:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
someone behind me who has um maybe a
 
06:09:10.788 --> 06:09:10.798 align:start position:0%
better um memory on those um grants than
 
06:09:12.110 --> 06:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
than I
 
06:09:14.548 --> 06:09:14.558 align:start position:0%
do represent
 
06:09:16.750 --> 06:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
leus is there a reason we're only
 
06:09:22.468 --> 06:09:22.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:22.478 --> 06:09:25.310 align:start position:0%
 
fact

06:09:25.310 --> 06:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
fact
 
06:09:29.430 --> 06:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
um I I I um I I I don't know what
 
06:09:31.510 --> 06:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
difference would make if it was before
 
06:09:33.830 --> 06:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
the fact because it's allowable under
 
06:09:33.840 --> 06:09:35.390 align:start position:0%
the fact because it's allowable under
federal

06:09:35.390 --> 06:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
federal
 
06:09:37.150 --> 06:09:37.160 align:start position:0%

it says seeks or intends to enroll and a
 
06:10:00.110 --> 06:10:00.120 align:start position:0%

06:10:36.548 --> 06:10:36.558 align:start position:0%
like Power School Infinite
 
06:10:40.788 --> 06:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
Campus um you know the what the schools
 
06:10:42.788 --> 06:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
use to hold their data we're not talking
 
06:10:46.150 --> 06:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
about that no okay no th those are um

beran

06:11:17.230 --> 06:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:21.270 --> 06:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
Emy good afternoon um for the record my
 
06:11:23.110 --> 06:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
name is am R Banfield I'm a parental
 
06:11:25.750 --> 06:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
rights Advocate focused on education in
 
06:11:29.548 --> 06:11:29.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I am supporting this bill
 
06:11:32.670 --> 06:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
um several years ago Democrats and
 
06:11:34.670 --> 06:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
Republicans came together to support
 
06:11:36.830 --> 06:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
privacy legislation for teachers working
 
06:11:39.110 --> 06:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
in our Public Schools I don't know if
 
06:11:40.390 --> 06:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
couple of you were here so you might
 
06:11:43.868 --> 06:11:43.878 align:start position:0%
remember that um privacy rights has been
 
06:11:47.190 --> 06:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan agenda for good
 
06:11:49.590 --> 06:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
reasons one can read the Privacy
 
06:11:52.150 --> 06:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
policies from edtech vendors to realize
 
06:11:53.990 --> 06:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
that a student's personal information
 
06:11:56.030 --> 06:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
can be shared without knowledge or
 
06:11:58.670 --> 06:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
consent from the students or parents
 
06:12:01.430 --> 06:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
because of the exceptions in the furpa
 
06:12:04.070 --> 06:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
law there is a misconception that the
 
06:12:06.070 --> 06:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
federal fle law protects a student's
 
06:12:07.788 --> 06:12:07.798 align:start position:0%
personal information but there are
 
06:12:09.590 --> 06:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
exceptions in that law that allow
 
06:12:11.868 --> 06:12:11.878 align:start position:0%
third-party vendors to share data
 
06:12:13.590 --> 06:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
without notification or
 
06:12:16.830 --> 06:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
consent I support 1695 because it is
 
06:12:18.430 --> 06:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
trying to close a loophole that
 
06:12:20.708 --> 06:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
currently exists or deal with that
 
06:12:22.708 --> 06:12:22.718 align:start position:0%
loophole however I do believe that
 
06:12:25.590 --> 06:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
sharing personal data via fura could
 
06:12:25.600 --> 06:12:27.548 align:start position:0%
sharing personal data via fura could
continue

06:12:27.548 --> 06:12:27.558 align:start position:0%
continue
 
06:12:29.868 --> 06:12:29.878 align:start position:0%
the bill as written could require an
 
06:12:32.230 --> 06:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
edtech company for instance to say we
 
06:12:34.510 --> 06:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
collected student data to develop our
 
06:12:36.430 --> 06:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
product and enhance our
 
06:12:38.548 --> 06:12:38.558 align:start position:0%
personalization It also says that they
 
06:12:40.590 --> 06:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
would have to notify parents that their
 
06:12:42.190 --> 06:12:42.200 align:start position:0%
students information was shared with the
 
06:12:45.390 --> 06:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
third party but that doesn't require
 
06:12:48.910 --> 06:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
them to name the data element shared and
 
06:12:51.150 --> 06:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
there's no enforcement mechanism that I
 
06:12:55.788 --> 06:12:55.798 align:start position:0%
could see Colorado's Bill hb1 1423 and
 
06:12:59.788 --> 06:12:59.798 align:start position:0%
20 16 included similar similar language
 
06:13:02.670 --> 06:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
but that bill did require data elements
 
06:13:05.270 --> 06:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
the bill did not include a pen penalty
 
06:13:07.670 --> 06:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
or an enforcement mechanism so companies
 
06:13:08.990 --> 06:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
do not
 
06:13:11.430 --> 06:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
comply I appreciate the sponsor's
 
06:13:13.150 --> 06:13:13.160 align:start position:0%
efforts but I think it can be a better
 
06:13:15.910 --> 06:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
Bill if it included a definition of
 
06:13:17.708 --> 06:13:17.718 align:start position:0%
Education purpose although I just read
 
06:13:19.230 --> 06:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
that and I think that is included in
 
06:13:22.670 --> 06:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
there um so that might part part might
 
06:13:24.590 --> 06:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
be um not
 
06:13:28.310 --> 06:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
accurate um it should require any pii
 
06:13:30.670 --> 06:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
disclosure first or third party or
 
06:13:32.990 --> 06:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
subcontractors or Partners to name data
 
06:13:36.110 --> 06:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
elements shared and purpose this should
 
06:13:37.590 --> 06:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
also be a requirement of the
 
06:13:40.548 --> 06:13:40.558 align:start position:0%
subcontractor and processors this would
 
06:13:43.548 --> 06:13:43.558 align:start position:0%
prevent unregulated Downstream sharing
 
06:13:46.150 --> 06:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
with internal Partners an example would
 
06:13:48.468 --> 06:13:48.478 align:start position:0%
be the College Board selling licenses to
 
06:13:52.510 --> 06:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
view student personal identified data or
 
06:13:54.670 --> 06:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
Navan sharing student data with its
 
06:13:56.590 --> 06:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
umbrella company who owns sever
 
06:13:56.600 --> 06:13:58.230 align:start position:0%
umbrella company who owns sever
advertising

06:13:58.230 --> 06:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
advertising
 
06:14:00.190 --> 06:14:00.200 align:start position:0%
companies there should also be an
 
06:14:04.390 --> 06:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
enforceable penalty such as if edtech
 
06:14:06.390 --> 06:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
company does not comply this will
 
06:14:08.670 --> 06:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
trigger both or either district attorney
 
06:14:10.948 --> 06:14:10.958 align:start position:0%
or attorney general investigation and
 
06:14:14.750 --> 06:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
possibly a fine of $110,000 for each
 
06:14:17.190 --> 06:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
violation we need to be serious about
 
06:14:19.030 --> 06:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
protecting student privacy in New
 
06:14:21.310 --> 06:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative cordelli has
 
06:14:24.230 --> 06:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
been leading this effort and I
 
06:14:26.230 --> 06:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate that in the past organ
 
06:14:28.628 --> 06:14:28.638 align:start position:0%
organizations like the ACLU has been a
 
06:14:30.830 --> 06:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
partner along with legislators on both
 
06:14:32.430 --> 06:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
sides of the political
 
06:14:36.590 --> 06:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
fence I ask that you pass this bill and
 
06:14:38.708 --> 06:14:38.718 align:start position:0%
possibly make an amendments including
 
06:14:40.110 --> 06:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
the the things that I
 
06:14:42.910 --> 06:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
suggested um that's my written testimony
 
06:14:44.430 --> 06:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
I do have a couple things I did want to
 
06:14:46.830 --> 06:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
mention I did sit on a Bedford privacy
 
06:14:49.150 --> 06:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
task force several years ago in that
 
06:14:51.628 --> 06:14:51.638 align:start position:0%
school district um to come up with a
 
06:14:55.750 --> 06:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
policy that was required by law and it
 
06:14:57.468 --> 06:14:57.478 align:start position:0%
basically what we were doing was trying
 
06:15:00.110 --> 06:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
to close that loophole parental consent
 
06:15:02.230 --> 06:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
when this data is shared that was what
 
06:15:05.110 --> 06:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
we were trying to do
 
06:15:08.830 --> 06:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
um so something needs to be done I think
 
06:15:10.430 --> 06:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
it it should be done at the state level
 
06:15:11.590 --> 06:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
because even though we worked on it in
 
06:15:13.230 --> 06:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
Bedford that's certainly not going to
 
06:15:15.468 --> 06:15:15.478 align:start position:0%
apply to every school district in the
 
06:15:18.310 --> 06:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
State uh an example of if you're looking
 
06:15:21.030 --> 06:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
for an example of how this information
 
06:15:22.708 --> 06:15:22.718 align:start position:0%
gets out or how this information is
 
06:15:25.590 --> 06:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
shared the uh New Mexico attorney
 
06:15:27.590 --> 06:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
general and Mississippian attorney
 
06:15:30.190 --> 06:15:30.200 align:start position:0%
general sued Google over children's
 
06:15:32.708 --> 06:15:32.718 align:start position:0%
privacy violations there was a $93
 
06:15:35.350 --> 06:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
million settlement so this is happening
 
06:15:37.670 --> 06:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
it does happen that's just one of many
 
06:15:39.670 --> 06:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
examples you can Google search and you
 
06:15:42.430 --> 06:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
can see how student privacy VI rights
 
06:15:45.628 --> 06:15:45.638 align:start position:0%
have been violated uh tends to be
 
06:15:47.430 --> 06:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
selling the
 
06:15:49.948 --> 06:15:49.958 align:start position:0%
information that's what it it it tends
 
06:15:53.310 --> 06:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
to be but it can go further than that so
 
06:15:55.510 --> 06:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
that was it thank you very much are
 
06:15:57.948 --> 06:15:57.958 align:start position:0%
there any any questions from the
 
06:16:01.590 --> 06:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent Bon thank you Mr
 
06:16:02.910 --> 06:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:16:05.350 --> 06:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
question um I guess I'm a little
 
06:16:09.910 --> 06:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
confused can can you explain more um
 
06:16:13.030 --> 06:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
with spe specifications what information
 
06:16:16.190 --> 06:16:16.200 align:start position:0%
is being shared um and how is that
 
06:16:18.030 --> 06:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
happening here in New Hampshire can you
 
06:16:20.190 --> 06:16:20.200 align:start position:0%
give like a a real specific example
 
06:16:23.430 --> 06:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
please sure so when the kids have their
 
06:16:25.390 --> 06:16:25.400 align:start position:0%
Chromebooks and they sign on to an app
 
06:16:27.390 --> 06:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
when they sign on to to any vendor any
 
06:16:29.110 --> 06:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
vendor that's that's coming into the
 
06:16:30.948 --> 06:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
school that that you're using on a
 
06:16:33.750 --> 06:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
computer that there is information being
 
06:16:36.628 --> 06:16:36.638 align:start position:0%
passed on to that vendor and if you read
 
06:16:39.708 --> 06:16:39.718 align:start position:0%
the vendor's privacy policy it will
 
06:16:42.788 --> 06:16:42.798 align:start position:0%
state this information is being
 
06:16:46.310 --> 06:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
protected per furpa so everybody reads
 
06:16:49.030 --> 06:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
that and thinks okay it's protected but
 
06:16:50.750 --> 06:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
they don't understand all the time is
 
06:16:52.230 --> 06:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
that and we discussed this at the
 
06:16:54.030 --> 06:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
Bedford when we when we did this at the
 
06:16:57.070 --> 06:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
Bedford um task force what they don't
 
06:17:00.150 --> 06:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
understand is that you think that the
 
06:17:02.230 --> 06:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
Privacy is protected you think that they
 
06:17:04.150 --> 06:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
can't go any further than that vendor
 
06:17:05.990 --> 06:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
well number one that vendor could be
 
06:17:11.350 --> 06:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
sold number two um they can uh exploit
 
06:17:14.468 --> 06:17:14.478 align:start position:0%
the furpa exception the fple loophole
 
06:17:16.030 --> 06:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
and so somebody else comes along and
 
06:17:18.548 --> 06:17:18.558 align:start position:0%
says well we want to research that
 
06:17:22.110 --> 06:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
information on these students can you
 
06:17:24.390 --> 06:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
now give us your in like when I talked
 
06:17:26.070 --> 06:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
to the Bedford superintendent he was
 
06:17:27.270 --> 06:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
like you know I'm not giving away
 
06:17:29.190 --> 06:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
information I said yes but once you've
 
06:17:31.548 --> 06:17:31.558 align:start position:0%
given it to these vendors once you've
 
06:17:35.390 --> 06:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
given it away they can then send it they
 
06:17:37.990 --> 06:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
can then sell it they can do if they
 
06:17:40.788 --> 06:17:40.798 align:start position:0%
call themselves an education researcher
 
06:17:43.070 --> 06:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
they can then share it that's the
 
06:17:46.670 --> 06:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
exception in in furpa so it's happening
 
06:17:49.070 --> 06:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
with any kind of vendor that is coming
 
06:17:51.270 --> 06:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
through the Chromebooks or coming to the
 
06:17:54.390 --> 06:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
school um it doesn't matter what vendor
 
06:17:57.390 --> 06:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
it is it if you read their privacy
 
06:18:00.510 --> 06:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
policies they're not private they're not
 
06:18:02.788 --> 06:18:02.798 align:start position:0%
private because they will site furpa but
 
06:18:04.788 --> 06:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
you have to understand that furpa has
 
06:18:06.390 --> 06:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
those exceptions and that that
 
06:18:09.190 --> 06:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
information can then leave that vendor
 
06:18:11.310 --> 06:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
if they say for instance they are an
 
06:18:12.990 --> 06:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
education researcher well I'm an
 
06:18:14.868 --> 06:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
education researcher they're going to
 
06:18:17.150 --> 06:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
give it to me I mean if if I pay the
 
06:18:20.670 --> 06:18:20.680 align:start position:0%
right price for it that's what I think
 
06:18:22.990 --> 06:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
this legislation is trying to do and I
 
06:18:24.868 --> 06:18:24.878 align:start position:0%
think this is one of the biggest concern
 
06:18:26.430 --> 06:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
for privacy rights
 
06:18:29.430 --> 06:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
Advocates across the United States is
 
06:18:32.628 --> 06:18:32.638 align:start position:0%
that that loophole exists and that it
 
06:18:35.390 --> 06:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
hasn't been addressed in many states or
 
06:18:38.670 --> 06:18:38.680 align:start position:0%
in many schools and in Bedford we we sat
 
06:18:41.270 --> 06:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
down and discussed that we came up with
 
06:18:44.590 --> 06:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
a privacy policy um my suggestion to
 
06:18:47.390 --> 06:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
Bedford was come up with a you know
 
06:18:51.190 --> 06:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
because okay do I have a consent form
 
06:18:53.350 --> 06:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
for every vendor we use in the school
 
06:18:56.390 --> 06:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
district how do we do this do you want
 
06:18:58.468 --> 06:18:58.478 align:start position:0%
to know this information am I or am I
 
06:19:01.230 --> 06:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
explaining too much I I can stop if you
 
06:19:02.548 --> 06:19:02.558 align:start position:0%
want to know it if you could just kind
 
06:19:05.070 --> 06:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
of summarize I'm just curious like so a
 
06:19:06.868 --> 06:19:06.878 align:start position:0%
vendor would be like um if a school
 
06:19:08.430 --> 06:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
district uses a
 
06:19:10.708 --> 06:19:10.718 align:start position:0%
particular app or something that the
 
06:19:13.510 --> 06:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
students sign on to what actual
 
06:19:15.590 --> 06:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
information is the student putting on
 
06:19:18.110 --> 06:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
there that's being saved or shared sure
 
06:19:21.868 --> 06:19:21.878 align:start position:0%
their name their um age I mean it
 
06:19:24.070 --> 06:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
depends vendors collect different
 
06:19:26.548 --> 06:19:26.558 align:start position:0%
information depending on what what that
 
06:19:29.948 --> 06:19:29.958 align:start position:0%
their scores their reading scores their
 
06:19:32.190 --> 06:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
if they're using an app for math
 
06:19:35.270 --> 06:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
anything like that um I don't think that
 
06:19:37.548 --> 06:19:37.558 align:start position:0%
those are really what
 
06:19:40.468 --> 06:19:40.478 align:start position:0%
sometimes you and I would consider to be
 
06:19:42.910 --> 06:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
a big deal maybe that's not something
 
06:19:45.390 --> 06:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
that would bother you if that
 
06:19:48.830 --> 06:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
information was you know passed on um
 
06:19:52.110 --> 06:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
but regardless there's other personal
 
06:19:54.390 --> 06:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
information apps that they they could be
 
06:19:57.390 --> 06:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
using now everything is digitalized now
 
06:19:59.590 --> 06:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
um you know in the past a lot of records
 
06:20:02.468 --> 06:20:02.478 align:start position:0%
were kept paper and we didn't have this
 
06:20:06.590 --> 06:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
issue but um really I think back when
 
06:20:09.230 --> 06:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
the the loophole
 
06:20:12.190 --> 06:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
was fura actually used to require this
 
06:20:15.270 --> 06:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
used to require parental consent and
 
06:20:18.788 --> 06:20:18.798 align:start position:0%
then it was um that was that was changed
 
06:20:21.948 --> 06:20:21.958 align:start position:0%
and I think it was 2016 if I'm not
 
06:20:26.548 --> 06:20:26.558 align:start position:0%
mistaken 2016 2017 so that was changed
 
06:20:28.750 --> 06:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
and then it allowed you know if you call
 
06:20:30.350 --> 06:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
for the exceptions that's when the
 
06:20:32.310 --> 06:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
exceptions came in I think I understand
 
06:20:34.430 --> 06:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank you forther questions from the
 
06:20:36.628 --> 06:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative Hall thank
 
06:20:38.030 --> 06:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:20:40.230 --> 06:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
question do you think school districts
 
06:20:42.390 --> 06:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
are aware of this and have put measures
 
06:20:44.990 --> 06:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
in place to deal with it I know I mean
 
06:20:47.430 --> 06:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
I've taught computers um and I'm going
 
06:20:49.910 --> 06:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
to say at least six years ago we were
 
06:20:53.070 --> 06:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
given a list and if if Adobe did this
 
06:20:54.390 --> 06:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
then they were going to shut it down and
 
06:20:56.070 --> 06:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
if another company did this and they
 
06:20:59.708 --> 06:20:59.718 align:start position:0%
were really on top of what the kids
 
06:21:02.230 --> 06:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
could sign in on and not and like us as
 
06:21:04.310 --> 06:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
Educators we were frustrated because we
 
06:21:05.430 --> 06:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't use these programs that we
 
06:21:08.708 --> 06:21:08.718 align:start position:0%
wanted to use so I guess my question to
 
06:21:10.468 --> 06:21:10.478 align:start position:0%
you is do you think most school
 
06:21:12.070 --> 06:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
districts are aware that this is going
 
06:21:14.230 --> 06:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
on and and to have measures in place I
 
06:21:16.548 --> 06:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
think that they are because when when I
 
06:21:18.310 --> 06:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
sat down with Bedford obviously they had
 
06:21:20.708 --> 06:21:20.718 align:start position:0%
their data people in the room with us as
 
06:21:22.708 --> 06:21:22.718 align:start position:0%
part of the task force so they were
 
06:21:26.670 --> 06:21:26.680 align:start position:0%
aware of a lot of a lot of um privacy
 
06:21:29.590 --> 06:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
issues but they need they have to know
 
06:21:32.788 --> 06:21:32.798 align:start position:0%
that the furpa law has those exceptions
 
06:21:35.310 --> 06:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
and that's the that's the section that
 
06:21:37.910 --> 06:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
if the data people do not understand the
 
06:21:41.868 --> 06:21:41.878 align:start position:0%
law that's how it's becoming um I would
 
06:21:44.150 --> 06:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
call it a loophole it's a loophole so
 
06:21:46.310 --> 06:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
all this information can be shared with
 
06:21:46.320 --> 06:21:46.990 align:start position:0%
all this information can be shared with
the

06:21:46.990 --> 06:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:21:49.788 --> 06:21:49.798 align:start position:0%
vendor and the vendor says well we're
 
06:21:51.468 --> 06:21:51.478 align:start position:0%
protecting the Privacy we're protecting
 
06:21:54.548 --> 06:21:54.558 align:start position:0%
the student we're protecting Copa fura
 
06:21:57.030 --> 06:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
all these laws are listed so when you
 
06:21:58.948 --> 06:21:58.958 align:start position:0%
look at their privacy policy and I look
 
06:22:00.868 --> 06:22:00.878 align:start position:0%
at them all the time and I work with the
 
06:22:03.150 --> 06:22:03.160 align:start position:0%
data security analyst and I work with
 
06:22:05.830 --> 06:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
somebody who's who's um who works on
 
06:22:09.868 --> 06:22:09.878 align:start position:0%
data security that yes it all appears to
 
06:22:13.070 --> 06:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
be secure but if you don't know about
 
06:22:15.070 --> 06:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
that fural loophole if you don't
 
06:22:17.310 --> 06:22:17.320 align:start position:0%
understand that there are exceptions and
 
06:22:22.230 --> 06:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
that prior to the um the change in that
 
06:22:25.190 --> 06:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
law parents did have to consent before
 
06:22:28.150 --> 06:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
the information could be shared the
 
06:22:29.910 --> 06:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
students aren't even consenting so
 
06:22:31.190 --> 06:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
students don't know where this
 
06:22:35.190 --> 06:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
information is going um so having a law
 
06:22:38.590 --> 06:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
in place having a a state law in place
 
06:22:40.670 --> 06:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
would mean that you're you're basically
 
06:22:42.510 --> 06:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
going back to the way things used to be
 
06:22:46.628 --> 06:22:46.638 align:start position:0%
prior to 2016 and and protecting that
 
06:22:51.190 --> 06:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
privacy um if that makes sense thank you
 
06:22:53.830 --> 06:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
very much forther questions thank you
 
06:22:57.390 --> 06:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
very much yeah uh Nancy
 
06:23:00.910 --> 06:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
butterman Beerman we'll get it right
 
06:23:04.468 --> 06:23:04.478 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll get it it's not spelled right
 
06:23:06.430 --> 06:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
I got the Nancy right yeah there you go
 
06:23:09.070 --> 06:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
that's the important part hi good
 
06:23:11.990 --> 06:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon um I agree with everything uh
 
06:23:15.230 --> 06:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
and Marie bfield just said um for HB uh
 
06:23:19.990 --> 06:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
1695 we are in support of it um but uh
 
06:23:21.590 --> 06:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
some of the things that you may not know
 
06:23:23.390 --> 06:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
that and I found out from our school
 
06:23:26.150 --> 06:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
district is that um through a right to
 
06:23:30.230 --> 06:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
know uh request um personal surveys and
 
06:23:32.510 --> 06:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
questionnaires were being given to the
 
06:23:34.510 --> 06:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
students in my school district and some
 
06:23:37.830 --> 06:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
of those were links to outside sources
 
06:23:41.110 --> 06:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
so that student data and information was
 
06:23:44.350 --> 06:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
not verified checked with any data
 
06:23:46.150 --> 06:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
person in the school the teachers like
 
06:23:47.628 --> 06:23:47.638 align:start position:0%
oh click on this link and answer these
 
06:23:49.468 --> 06:23:49.478 align:start position:0%
questions and we'll find out your
 
06:23:51.590 --> 06:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
personality or your learning style and
 
06:23:53.868 --> 06:23:53.878 align:start position:0%
it's no big deal well every time you
 
06:23:56.150 --> 06:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
click click on any link you know
 
06:23:57.708 --> 06:23:57.718 align:start position:0%
information's going out those cookies
 
06:24:00.510 --> 06:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
are being collected and um you know you
 
06:24:02.190 --> 06:24:02.200 align:start position:0%
may think it's not a big deal but
 
06:24:03.750 --> 06:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
they're collecting on everything and
 
06:24:05.190 --> 06:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to figure out how to
 
06:24:08.110 --> 06:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
connect you with everything um my
 
06:24:10.110 --> 06:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
concern also is all the zoom classes
 
06:24:11.670 --> 06:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
there was issues with zoom and zoom
 
06:24:13.150 --> 06:24:13.160 align:start position:0%
collecting data and
 
06:24:16.030 --> 06:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
information um and then we have the Sora
 
06:24:18.948 --> 06:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
app that everybody uses to uh access
 
06:24:20.868 --> 06:24:20.878 align:start position:0%
textbooks where's all that information
 
06:24:22.948 --> 06:24:22.958 align:start position:0%
going and if you click on this book you
 
06:24:24.310 --> 06:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
know what does that say about you and
 
06:24:25.948 --> 06:24:25.958 align:start position:0%
then we're going to try to you know have
 
06:24:28.468 --> 06:24:28.478 align:start position:0%
this information for you and then um
 
06:24:30.430 --> 06:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
finally since we seem to be focusing on
 
06:24:32.628 --> 06:24:32.638 align:start position:0%
mental health and everything where's all
 
06:24:34.070 --> 06:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
that data going because you know they're
 
06:24:36.708 --> 06:24:36.718 align:start position:0%
collecting it digitally and so then as
 
06:24:38.628 --> 06:24:38.638 align:start position:0%
an adult if you go to get a job or you
 
06:24:40.548 --> 06:24:40.558 align:start position:0%
go to join the military or do anything
 
06:24:42.708 --> 06:24:42.718 align:start position:0%
else who's got that information on you
 
06:24:43.868 --> 06:24:43.878 align:start position:0%
and is that going to keep you from
 
06:24:45.430 --> 06:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
getting a job or joining the military
 
06:24:48.430 --> 06:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
because of some link that you clicked on
 
06:24:50.030 --> 06:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
in third grade that your teacher said
 
06:24:53.830 --> 06:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
was okay so again personal information
 
06:24:55.750 --> 06:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
they're collecting it everywhere and
 
06:24:57.948 --> 06:24:57.958 align:start position:0%
they're so far ahead of us and we can't
 
06:25:00.150 --> 06:25:00.160 align:start position:0%
even fathom what they're doing but it's
 
06:25:02.110 --> 06:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
all out there and it's all sold for a
 
06:25:04.948 --> 06:25:04.958 align:start position:0%
price so thank you thank you very much
 
06:25:07.110 --> 06:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the
 
06:25:10.110 --> 06:25:10.120 align:start position:0%
