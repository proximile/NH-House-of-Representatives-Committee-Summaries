we're here on the on the 12th of
 
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
October uh with the the committee on
 
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.430 align:start position:0%
October uh with the the committee on
committees

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
uh looking to uh continue to reduce a
 
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
number of committees and commissions
 
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.150 align:start position:0%
number of committees and commissions
that

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh legislature is dealing with
 
00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 align:start position:0%
specifically today we wanted to uh
 
00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
review the first first up was to review
 
00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:07.390 align:start position:0%
review the first first up was to review
the

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
trifold uh pamphlet that that uh Miz
 
00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald passed out last time we were
 
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
here and so we'll like to go around the
 
00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
whole room a little bit at a time as to
 
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
what your thoughts were or any
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
suggestions that you have to um change
 
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
some of the emphasis or some of the
 
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
words or uh reemphasize what's
 
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
here U
 
00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
one be better in the template
 
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
where disc did you get backgr
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
information do you have legisla I think
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
question do you think it's like a banner
 
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:56.950 align:start position:0%
 
here

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
question yeah like
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
yeah under the where to begin it says
 
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
the problem you're trying to solve is
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
you so somewhere right in there yeah to
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
begin Oney the imag
 
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
you are you trying to solve what
 
00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
information do you not have um have you
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
talked to
 
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
OS have you gotten legislative history I
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
mean it's the same information you guys
 
00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
have in here I'm just wondering if
 
00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
freezing its questions would um make
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
people engage a little more I think
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's easy to gloss over when
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
you're reading information and not
 
00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
really think about the step you have to
 
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
take to satisfy it so basically
 
00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
represent R to change it all to
 
00:08:41.469 --> 00:08:41.479 align:start position:0%
questions as opposed to bullets yeah I
 
00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:43.399 align:start position:0%
think that's Bas that's and others may
 
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
not agree that just was my initial
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
thought looking at it and I don't know
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
that that would change anything with the
 
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
um yeah and think specifically about the
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
um but you know other have thoughts
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
about whether there's ways that could be
 
00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
think uh overall I really like it I
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
think I I like representative
 
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
rbos you know the questions as prompts
 
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:21.320 align:start position:0%
at least under number one clarify the
 
00:09:25.069 --> 00:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
need um and I actually don't think that
 
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
it by starting those first two as
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
questions I think the rest of it can
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
flow just fine the way it's written
 
00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
um I think it's great I mean it is very
 
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
text heavy right I
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
think did a really great job adding some
 
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
photos to make it engaging something
 
00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
that people are actually gonna take the
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
time to flip through um and it brings it
 
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:53.320 align:start position:0%
to life a little bit obviously um I
 
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
think and this is maybe a question for
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
the larger group if we feel like it's
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
too text Heavy does it make sense to put
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
a URL or a QR code or something like
 
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
that where you can get more information
 
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
on it and I don't I don't have strong
 
00:10:10.269 --> 00:10:10.279 align:start position:0%
feelings on it I I would take this and
 
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
feel like I've got what I need it's
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
tough I like if you put a code then it's
 
00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
another step people to take text and I
 
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
don't know if people do it but I I do
 
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
understand we're trying to get a lot in
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
here and it's it's dense
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
um which almost want like if if we do
 
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
have the template online at some point
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
if a link to the template is worthwhile
 
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:29.240 align:start position:0%
maybe because that's something people
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
need to fill out um but I don't know
 
00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:34.519 align:start position:0%
what would be best thoughts about lack
 
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
how to cut down on density in just for
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
review there is a template right the uh
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
template is just at a starting point
 
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
right now we haven't finished it and
 
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
that's going to take a little bit of
 
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
time as we're in our busy period right
 
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
now um but I I like your idea of a URL
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
or you know a QR code because there is
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
you know additional information that we
 
00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
already have and that we will have in
 
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
the future so I think that would be
 
00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
great if we just have one point to point
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
everybody to I we to the point of the
 
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
questions I think when we first did this
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
we had them as questions that where to
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
begin but it's you know it is a lot of
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
information to fit in a trifold and we
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
had to change it I mean not that we
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
can't make it a question again it just
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
does change the formatting in the in the
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
temp tell me why you decided not to do
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
that because maybe there are reasons I'm
 
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
not thinking no that was the reason
 
00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:24.839 align:start position:0%
because of the yeah the formatting so we
 
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
we could consider that again and you
 
00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
know work with it some more this of
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
course it's just a draft but um I I
 
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
again I also like really like that idea
 
00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
of a URL or a or a code here so we can
 
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
point to where all of our information is
 
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
and where the template will eventually
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
be great thank you just know that me
 
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
sharing these ideas is uh it's not
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
because I think this is not great
 
00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
because it's excellent It's because I
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
feel like I'm really put on the spot
 
00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
that I
 
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
need we to improve it somehow feel like
 
00:11:55.389 --> 00:11:55.399 align:start position:0%
the perfect the of the good here a
 
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
little bit I mean this is the good
 
00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.949 align:start position:0%
little bit I mean this is the good
pamphlet

00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
pamphlet
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
but John what do you you got any
 
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
thoughts um I read it over quite a few
 
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:05.240 align:start position:0%
times and the more I read it the better
 
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
I liked it and my
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
only thought with it is when we do the
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
training we go over this and the
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
training for the newbies is
 
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
mandatory this this isn't you know oh I
 
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
I know how to do this stuff no we got
 
00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:26.519 align:start position:0%
people who have been here two and three
 
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
turns don't know how to do this right
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
and even even the Reps that do know how
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
to do it I've done this for you know
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
four terms and I'm going yeah this is
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
pretty cool and it gives me another
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
Insight every time I read it there was
 
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
more information that I got out of it so
 
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
I like it and I know it's
 
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
preliminary I like it and I think the
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
training to the newbies on how to do
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
this should be virtually
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
mandatory because it doesn't matter
 
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
whether you've been here 6 eight years
 
00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:05.079 align:start position:0%
like I have or this is your first or
 
00:13:05.079 --> 00:13:06.990 align:start position:0%
like I have or this is your first or
second

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
day if you want to do it right do it
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
right we are planning on having training
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
in the new member orientation as well as
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
in chairs and vice chairs training at
 
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
the beginning of a term and then we'll
 
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
have the continuing ed I don't know if
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
we can make it mandatory but certainly
 
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
we're trying to encourage participation
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
as much as possible and if you can f if
 
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
you can folks if you folks can help help
 
00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:30.519 align:start position:0%
us to encourage participation that would
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
be wonderful but yeah during part of the
 
00:13:34.509 --> 00:13:34.519 align:start position:0%
training we we will hand these out even
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
if just in a draft form I think it would
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
be helpful to have these in a draft form
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
initially as we work through things and
 
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
find little improvements before we spend
 
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
money and and print them professionally
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
that's what the mail boxes are for thank
 
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
you let me piig you back some of comment
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
you said for the training
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
part what if just throw this out as a
 
00:14:00.749 --> 00:14:00.759 align:start position:0%
thought what if we deput deputize and
 
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
use that word uh the folks on this
 
00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:06.519 align:start position:0%
committee to go out to the various
 
00:14:06.519 --> 00:14:07.749 align:start position:0%
committee to go out to the various
policy

00:14:07.749 --> 00:14:07.759 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
committees uh and give a you know a five
 
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
or 10
 
00:14:16.509 --> 00:14:16.519 align:start position:0%
minute uh dump as to you know what this
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
is all about why it's important how do
 
00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:22.279 align:start position:0%
you do this uh going through the
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
pamphlet I don't know what do you what
 
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
do you guys think about that would that
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
be effective do you
 
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.389 align:start position:0%
be effective do you
think

00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I think we can leave that
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
up to you I will just say that I believe
 
00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519 align:start position:0%
that all the chairs and vice chairs have
 
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
you know received a similar message as
 
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
to what you folks are doing and the
 
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
importance of of these I I don't know if
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
they're pushing that down to all of
 
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
their committee members or members that
 
00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:52.519 align:start position:0%
aren't on committees I'm not sure how
 
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
they're getting the message but if you
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
think that would be
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
valuable and the other item I want to
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
mention that when we've had these in the
 
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
past um 2019
 
00:15:04.749 --> 00:15:04.759 align:start position:0%
2015 and I don't know how many years
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
back this has always been the best
 
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
attended of all of our continuing ed
 
00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:11.959 align:start position:0%
programs and the room was always packed
 
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
with at least 150 packed into the seats
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
and the Overflow out into the um hallway
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
so I think that we'll be able to Dum up
 
00:15:23.949 --> 00:15:23.959 align:start position:0%
plus we're also we're going to think of
 
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
other enticements to make sure that
 
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:27.160 align:start position:0%
people are here so we'll make an effort
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
and also as Deborah mentioned
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
the chairs and vice chairs meetings we
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
will talk it up and we'll ask all the
 
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:34.120 align:start position:0%
chairs and vice chairs to ask their
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
membership to to
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
attend yeah and say you know and we can
 
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
encourage our ranking and Deputy ranking
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
members to do the same and uh if anybody
 
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
has a creative idea given that our
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
caucuses are pretty uh pretty evenly
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
split in the house chamber if we want to
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
do some sort of a friendly competition
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
around attendance you know pizza party
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
something like that you know good idea
 
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
happy to entertain them yeah we can we
 
00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:00.839 align:start position:0%
can lean on the the speaker to buy pizza
 
00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
that's right and and I I think I think
 
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
at the training that we should be part
 
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
training because we're the ones who are
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
basically blessing this thing and
 
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
understand in depth what happens if you
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
don't follow the rules and we can speak
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
to that along with the training I think
 
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
we we could everybody can add their two
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
cents in or have a little little piece
 
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
of what we're doing well certainly
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
discuss that with the speaker he has
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
provided recommendations of of members
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
and staff who
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
will participate in the presentations
 
00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
during the training it's a short amount
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
of time to cram in a lot of information
 
00:16:43.309 --> 00:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
too but um we we'll bring that back to
 
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
you yeah um I just have a little bit of
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
feedback that's going to be encouraging
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
for you um this past week a season
 
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
legislator reached out to me and said
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
hey I know you're working on a format do
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
you have it yet do you have it yet cuz I
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
have you know a bill I'd like to put in
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
and I said you know we're still working
 
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
on it but I think that that speaks to
 
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
the work we're doing people know about
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
it and they're looking to do it the
 
00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:12.039 align:start position:0%
right way so I I think this is great and
 
00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
it's going to be helpful and I think
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
that legislators are are looking for
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
guidance So yeah thank you by the way if
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
you if you're you're hearing in the
 
00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:23.799 align:start position:0%
background some beeping noise you're
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
wondering what what that is that's
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
that's me beeping I I I'm a diabetic and
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
I have a device that I wear that's
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
beeping telling me to find a piece of
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
candy I'm I'm okay I just I just want
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
you to not be afraid that we're we're
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
about to have a fire alarm or
 
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
something thank you thanks now that we
 
00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
operating right have some thoughts or
 
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.470 align:start position:0%
operating right have some thoughts or
comments

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
yeah um no I I was not nodding along
 
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
along with representative Sheen because
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
I've had the same experience over the
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
last weeks during filing period of folks
 
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
asking really specific questions so I
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
think that's a really good sign um but
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
no I I love the flyer and my only
 
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
feedback was and I don't know if you
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
have room for this but um just to spell
 
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
out what HCS is the first time it comes
 
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
on that first column of where to begin
 
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
so I it's it's on the I think it's on
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
another panel like health committee
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
services but here on this panel of where
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
to begin it says OS will work with HCS
 
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:37.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm just thinking I was actually
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
here for kind of a long time before I
 
00:18:42.149 --> 00:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
knew what HCS stood
 
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
for so I'm thinking for our newer folks
 
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
if if you can fit fit house committee
 
00:18:51.789 --> 00:18:51.799 align:start position:0%
Services equals HCS down there I think
 
00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:54.039 align:start position:0%
that would be a little helpful just a
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
minor thing thank you so you want it
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
bulleted there in both places yeah okay
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
all right and again we were doing that
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
for the I know I was just thinking
 
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
people are going to open it up here okay
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
and see this probably before they see
 
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
that back panel yep so that's that's
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
just yeah and I don't know if
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
that anyway good Fe I also think it's
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
fine if it doesn't happen just to be
 
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
clear we want to be as clear as possible
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
so we can do that change thank you thank
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
you repetition is good
 
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
right what they say people get it after
 
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
about three or four times yeah Jim what
 
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
get I really don't have anything to add
 
00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
I apologize for being late uh today um
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I I thought that the the I'm I'm
 
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
assuming that this has not changed since
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
the last time we saw it yet and so I
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
looked over I thought it was a a very
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
nice summary so um I think it looks good
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
one of the thoughts that I had
 
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.669 align:start position:0%
one of the thoughts that I had
was

00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm just thinking if I was a
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
freshman and try to walk myself through
 
00:20:14.669 --> 00:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
it it would be nice to be able to have
 
00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919 align:start position:0%
something like this that
 
00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
was would also lend itself to a
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
fill-in-the blank type of pamphlet so I
 
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
would take this around with me I'd go to
 
00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:29.720 align:start position:0%
OS I'd go to
 
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
to uh HCS to HCS and I I'd go to my my
 
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
local chairman and I'd be making notes
 
00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:39.559 align:start position:0%
or writing things down that I needed to
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
do but there's no space put that I know
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh having a lot of space in a trifold is
 
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
not doesn't they don't really work
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
together so I don't know if it if it
 
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
means should it should it
 
00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:00.919 align:start position:0%
be for folds instead of three should to
 
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
be two sheets that staple together I I'm
 
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
just thinking of a way to expand a space
 
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
for a a young legislator to start making
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
notes of who he who he or she spoke with
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
or or what's next for them to do or who
 
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
to go see
 
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
next I'm thinking as a freshman I'm
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
going to go talk
 
00:21:28.669 --> 00:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
to the minority leader and and he's
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
going to tell me make sure you speak
 
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
with chairman Smith on this one and make
 
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
sure you go see well how do I keep it'
 
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
be nice if I had some a spot to make
 
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
notes of what he told me or or what I
 
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
have to go do and so so the so it's
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
really a geography issue geography of
 
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
where you would where we could find the
 
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
space to do that you don't want to make
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
the printing so small that you need a
 
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
magnifying glasses to see it but just
 
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
feedback to think about is is there a
 
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
way to do that is like I said is it a
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
second sheet is it a quad fold instead
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
or so that's that's my feedback yeah Jim
 
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
um one way to achieve that is with a QR
 
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
code um that points to a website um it
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
takes up some real estate on the thing
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
but you could potentially put it on the
 
00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
front but it's a kind of for more
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
information and it gives people a quick
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
way to get there I second that I think
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's a great idea that you would scan
 
00:22:42.269 --> 00:22:42.279 align:start position:0%
what right it's it's it's one of those
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
um Square codes that looks like a bunch
 
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
of sort black and white dots and it just
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
you scan it with your phone it takes you
 
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
to a web page so um I mean you you could
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
just as well put a URL on here but
 
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
people MH usually aren't going to type
 
00:23:00.669 --> 00:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
it but but if you you have a QR code
 
00:23:03.269 --> 00:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
people just you know for our new our new
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
younger legislators that uh would have
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
to now come back teach us how to use the
 
00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.510 align:start position:0%
to now come back teach us how to use the
QR

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
QR
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
code it'll be I think it's a great
 
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
learning opportunity for everybody teach
 
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
them how to establish study committees
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
and commissions they teach us they teach
 
00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
us about QR
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
codes if I may Mr chairman yes first of
 
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
all leader wilham suggested that as well
 
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
and that I think that's a great idea
 
00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
adding a QR code for more information
 
00:23:31.149 --> 00:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
sorry I keep turning away and then I
 
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
lose the mic uh the other on on your
 
00:23:35.909 --> 00:23:35.919 align:start position:0%
idea about making notes I think it might
 
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
be helpful when we have that study
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
template ready to go because that will
 
00:23:43.149 --> 00:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
pretty much be in a fill theblank you
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
know fill theblank format as far as the
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
things that we need in a in an LSR for
 
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
this type of you know for this type of
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
LSR for a committee or commission so I
 
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
know we don't have that yet and it'll be
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit before we have it but that
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
may be an area where you can make notes
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
on because that's where you'll be
 
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
filling in name of the commission and
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
you know the the start date end date the
 
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
appoes that are needed and and stuff
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
like that I'm I'm thinking
 
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh what comes to mind when I think about
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
that process is OS is that is that a a
 
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
spot when when they you know we're
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
directing them to go to
 
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
OSS is that where they get that
 
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
information I with a with the QR code
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
they can bring it up themselves well
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
when they go to os does s hand them a
 
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:35.240 align:start position:0%
sheet and say this is what here's
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
a you know a 90% blank sheet with
 
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
fill-in the blank stuff is that where
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
they get it perhaps we'll have to
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
confirm the the details on the process
 
00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:46.919 align:start position:0%
for the template after we have the
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
template I mean I think that's a
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectation but certainly
 
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
with the QR code it can bring you right
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.070 --> 00:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
yep anybody else have any additional
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
thoughts about about the
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
trifold we should do it great great job
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
by the way it's it I think uh we 98% of
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
the way there so any suggestions you're
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
getting from us are just to enhance
 
00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:16.279 align:start position:0%
what's already there not to really
 
00:25:16.279 --> 00:25:18.510 align:start position:0%
what's already there not to really
change

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.510 align:start position:0%
change
much

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
um okay uh John you wanted we wanted the
 
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
floor okay thank you uh our past list of
 
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh recommend recommended committees and
 
00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:38.039 align:start position:0%
commissions which we want to uh put in
 
00:25:38.039 --> 00:25:38.789 align:start position:0%
commissions which we want to uh put in
the

00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
can uh I sent out on 1011 a memo to uh
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
four of the people that are on different
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh RSA committees I I picked out four
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
committees out of the stack of however
 
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
many there are and uh I took
 
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
49-1 uh 28
 
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
B1 25 j11 and 404
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
J1 and I sent this memo out to uh the
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
people that were listed on the committee
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
list and it says good evening
 
00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:20.200 align:start position:0%
representative shirtliff Wier Harrington
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
and hunt and I
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
copied uh I sent it to them I copied Deb
 
00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.830 align:start position:0%
copied uh I sent it to them I copied Deb
uh

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
an Vanessa the chair Sherm and the
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
speaker good evening Representatives you
 
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:37.640 align:start position:0%
are all members of a commission which is
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
being reviewed for removal from the rsas
 
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
due to some particular reason as the
 
00:26:44.909 --> 00:26:44.919 align:start position:0%
vice chair of the committee on
 
00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
commissions I am tasked to investigate
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
removing slash repealing commissions no
 
00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:50.870 align:start position:0%
removing slash repealing commissions no
longer

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
longer
 
00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
required the following is a list of
 
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
commissions with RSA which are being
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
recommended for removal repeal this is
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
just my piece of the list you may or
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
will be contacted by other members of
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
the committee Visa Vis other commissions
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
or rsas being considered for removal
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
please let me know ASAP whether you as a
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
House member on the commission concur or
 
00:27:16.269 --> 00:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
not and like I said I selected four of
 
00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
them uh I got this was two weeks ago and
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
I got re I got uh answers back from all
 
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
four of the members uh the first one was
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh from representative schliff and uh I
 
00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:37.799 align:start position:0%
recommended uh my qu my question to him
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
was question can this maintenance be
 
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:41.480 align:start position:0%
done in conjunction with virtually all
 
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
other New Hampshire State memorials in
 
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
conquer uh in as much as it is a state
 
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:50.200 align:start position:0%
uh sculpture on State Property should
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
not the state automatically be
 
00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:54.200 align:start position:0%

you know e you know from from any
 
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
view because that that one might take a
 
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
little extra research okay before you go
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:43.039 align:start position:0%
this okay uh representative Rambo I used
 
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
the list that we had yes okay oh the
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
okay RSA
 
00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
491 was representative
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
shff and rep representative Wilds 28 B1
 
00:30:59.039 --> 00:31:01.190 align:start position:0%
shff and rep representative Wilds 28 B1
right

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:08.509 --> 00:31:08.519 align:start position:0%
perfect and representative Sheen is 356
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
B70 she's she's took that
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
one okay so we're good may I ask a
 
00:31:17.549 --> 00:31:17.559 align:start position:0%
couple questions yeah go ahead sh the
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
the first question is on the wi and
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
Memorial will speaker shlif be coming in
 
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
to speak about that I I invited him and
 
00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
well he really didn't want to see it
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
because I don't I don't know maybe a
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
personal reason but because it's a state
 
00:31:42.029 --> 00:31:42.039 align:start position:0%
Memorial on State Property I'm
 
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
recommending that the state take over it
 
00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
because they they have it anyway and
 
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
what I what I what I believe his
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
commission is is being is a
 
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
watchdog and do we need another Watchdog
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
commission just for every
 
00:31:56.159 --> 00:31:57.669 align:start position:0%
commission just for every
state

00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:00.200 align:start position:0%
piece of material we have one State
 
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
Property what's his thought on it what's
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
shir's thought on that he well okay I
 
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
will I have the response
 
00:32:12.629 --> 00:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
here uh hi John yes it's my
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
understanding that maintenance on the
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
wet Memorial can be done in conjunction
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
with other state memorials in conquer
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
now let me give you some background of
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
why the three-person wiing committee was
 
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
formed when I introduced the legislation
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
to have the wet Memorial placed on State
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
Property the grounds of the New
 
00:32:30.669 --> 00:32:30.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Library I also include
 
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
the provisions for a three member wi
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
committee that's a committee not a
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
commission committee automatically ends
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
at the end of the
 
00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
banum but it is a commission anyway uh
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
the original
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
one sometimes the terms are used
 
00:32:54.029 --> 00:32:54.039 align:start position:0%
interchangeably this way was drafted but
 
00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
anyway I know it's a commission anyway
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
because it's an RSA uh the W the
 
00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:00.200 align:start position:0%
original Wier fundraising committee was
 
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
concerned that the state was always not
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
the best custodian of historic
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
properties and memorials for example the
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
conditions of the Robert Frost Farm in
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
Dairy the Daniel Webster Farm in
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
Salisbury Etc so similar to the state
 
00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
law enforcement memorial legislation I
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
included the provision allowing for the
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
three person wiing commission currently
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
the commission is made up of myself Paul
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
Smith and Carrie Johnson from the New
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Historical resources
 
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:29.320 align:start position:0%
because of the relative newness of the
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
wet Memorial the committee hasn't had to
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
provide any additional maintenance in
 
00:33:35.629 --> 00:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
the future if we find that additional
 
00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:37.240 align:start position:0%
maintenance work is needed for the wiet
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
memorial that the state is unable to
 
00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
perform the whing committee will be able
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
need that sounds like he's not in favor
 
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
of he's he's really not in favor of
 
00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:55.720 align:start position:0%
getting rid of it but it is a state
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
Memorial on state Grant grounds and the
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
responsibility to maintain State
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
memorials on state grounds is the state
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire why
 
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
would this one Memorial have an
 
00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:13.399 align:start position:0%
oversight Committee of three
 
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
people it sounds like we need to have
 
00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
Steve come in and talk to us I I'm of
 
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
the belief yeah like I said there's
 
00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.389 align:start position:0%
the belief yeah like I said there's
enough

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity that I don't I don't think
 
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
we need to wrestle over any of these no
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
I'm saying that that we need to discuss
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh um I got uh R 125 j11 Bob Scott the
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
dees commissioner says that's not needed
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
when the commissioner said it's not
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
needed it's not
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
needed final report okay 404 J1 the
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
final reports due December 2024 and John
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
Hunt already has this on LSR to kill it
 
00:34:58.829 --> 00:34:58.839 align:start position:0%
so we can asked John to pull it and put
 
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
it on the on with us on the bill that
 
00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.950 align:start position:0%

representative well Mary Griffin's not
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
in the house anymore it could be Barbara
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
Griffin also oh Barbara Griffin also the
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
c37 which is archived I can tell you
 
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
that the the the the the issue of
 
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
democratic demographic Trends came up in
 
00:36:56.309 --> 00:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
Carol Maguire's Committee in the last
 
00:36:56.319 --> 00:36:58.150 align:start position:0%
Carol Maguire's Committee in the last
session

00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
and the decision was made um not to
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
invoke a new committee or or amend uh a
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
new opportunity because uh UNH was was
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
suppli was supplying that data free of
 
00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.630 align:start position:0%
suppli was supplying that data free of
charge

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
charge
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
without any oversight needed and the uh
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee and both
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle thought that what UNH
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
was supplying was more than adequate and
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
we didn't we didn't need a another
 
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
special committee or commission to
 
00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.550 align:start position:0%
special committee or commission to
oversee

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
oversee
 
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
that so that that's a source for I would
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
I would suggest just touching base with
 
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.950 align:start position:0%
I would suggest just touching base with
Carol

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
Carol
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
Maguire and
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
and okay yeah and perhaps her the
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
got a uniform thought on that sure thank
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
maybe reaching out to the Senate might
 
00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.390 align:start position:0%
maybe reaching out to the Senate might
also

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
be yeah that maybe the house was more
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
willing to do is that what I'm reading
 
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
am I reading that correctly that maybe
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
the house was more willing to get rid of
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
it but we need both bodies to agree so I
 
00:38:19.359 --> 00:38:20.309 align:start position:0%
it but we need both bodies to agree so I
I

00:38:20.309 --> 00:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:38:23.309 --> 00:38:23.319 align:start position:0%
think to repeal it we don't need both
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
bodies uh but it would make it cleaner
 
00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
if we had both bodies but I think I
 
00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
think on our own we can we can end a
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
committee or or a commission without
 
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
without the Senate they they they can
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
us I think that I had I don't know I
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's true I think I
 
00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
think in order to repeal a committee or
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
commission which is established by both
 
00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
Chambers we need to we need to pass
 
00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
legislation through both Chambers and
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
then have it signed by the Govern you
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
have any thoughts on that
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's laws we it's a law
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
and we can repeal it both both houses
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
have to repeal
 
00:39:09.069 --> 00:39:09.079 align:start position:0%
it all right uh anybody want yes that
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
makes sense and I did just forward you
 
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
an email which has information on the
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
house members and the senate members as
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
well I did have one more question I hate
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
to go back back again but I just want to
 
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm clear the the Harrington
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
and representative hunt bills okay hunt
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
and Harrington have lsrs in yeah all all
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
I wanted to say is I did let them know
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
that the speaker prefers that they pull
 
00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
their lsrs and include it on the retain
 
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
bill sp84 um I I mentioned that but I'm
 
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
just a staff person will a legislator be
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
following up with them to make sure and
 
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's exactly what I got
 
00:39:45.309 --> 00:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
from both of them they'd be willing to
 
00:39:47.069 --> 00:39:47.079 align:start position:0%
pull them if oh perfect we're g to put
 
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
them on the okay so you already reached
 
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
out to them to let them know about sb84
 
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
and and that's yeah because that's
 
00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
that's what I said removing appealing
 
00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.950 align:start position:0%
that's what I said removing appealing
and

00:39:59.950 --> 00:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
John I got to figure out which one's
 
00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:05.829 align:start position:0%
John I got to figure out which one's
from

00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%

willing to serve and remain for the
 
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
duration of their term feedback has been
 
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
that it is not productive one rep
 
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it is a duplication of
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
Dees efforts which it may be if you
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
contact the dees
 
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner committee could discuss
 
00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
with house members who are currently
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
serving as a starting
 
00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
one basically they me mentioned already
 
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.109 --> 00:44:56.119 align:start position:0%
want and now who's who's the leader ERS
 
00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
ship that's saying they don't want it um
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
feedback has has been that it is not
 
00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.230 align:start position:0%
feedback has has been that it is not
productive

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
productive
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
so uh get a hold of mcgu or or one of
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
the senators or donelly somebody on the
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
list and say hey what's your what's your
 
00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
feeling from your committee and they can

meeting we'll have this whole
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
thing figure out what we want to do with
 
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
it and then we can move on and put
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
together the
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
paperwork from
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh down here I put the amendment
 
00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.510 align:start position:0%
uh down here I put the amendment
in

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:43.839 align:start position:0%
to kill it the the one word that that's
 
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
per peing my interest is it's a duplic
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
duplication Dees effort yeah get a hold
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
of Dees commissioner going all the way
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
back though to the to the uh committee
 
00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:55.079 align:start position:0%
the citation that um it's a commission
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
on drinking water drinking water is such
 
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
a Hot Topic right now in the state I I
 
00:46:03.069 --> 00:46:03.079 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's a duplication or
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
something else if we could get support
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
widespread support to kill it U I'm just
 
00:46:10.349 --> 00:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
thinking out loud it's got to be on a
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
bill got any
 
00:46:18.549 --> 00:46:18.559 align:start position:0%
thoughts I know with you know with the p
 
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:20.440 align:start position:0%
and all that stuff that's going on I
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
will just note that we have a Pas
 
00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:24.200 align:start position:0%
commission that is very popular we have
 
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
several reps who always want to be on it
 
00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
every year um and there's a struggle to
 
00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
pick from the long list of people
 
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
interested that is a separate commission
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
than this one this one it is hard to get
 
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
members interested in serving and to
 
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
remain on let me wrestle with this one
 
00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:41.480 align:start position:0%

judicial Council in process of
 
00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
scheduling meeting and this was as of
 
00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.549 align:start position:0%
scheduling meeting and this was as of
September

00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
2023 actually he the acting director has
 
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
um contacted us because he wanted to
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
meet in the LOB and as you know we don't
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
have outside groups meeting in the L so
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
he was looking for an alternative place
 
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
for them to meet and I haven't been in
 
00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
contact with him since he may have found
 
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
a place to meet and they were very
 
00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
active meeting on a regular basis here
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
um so I'll find I will get the name of
 
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
the acting executive director for
 
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
someone to um contact to find out where
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
they may have been meeting right right
 
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
up until now and they as we've mentioned
 
00:48:26.109 --> 00:48:26.119 align:start position:0%
before some of these groups that meet do
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
not contact our our office or the
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
clerk's office so we have no way of
 
00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
knowing that they are meeting and it
 
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes do not end up in the house
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
calendar but I will get that
 
00:48:41.549 --> 00:48:41.559 align:start position:0%
name Roy is he a target
 
00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
of trying to uh kill this I don't
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
know Terry I can reach out to them and
 
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
ask you want talk to want take this one
 
00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll take that one okay we I'll get
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
that name for you you're welcome yeah
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
and I think doesn't mean we have to kill
 
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:02.839 align:start position:0%
it but once we had know okay when did
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
they have a last meeting do we have
 
00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
published minutes uh when's our next
 
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
scheduled meeting it might kind of get
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
them off the dime too saying oh yeah we
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
we want to keep this going it's active
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's important and you know maybe
 
00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:18.839 align:start position:0%
just a little a nudge well and if we
 
00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
can't get clear answers we can invite
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
yeah we can invite them in and have them
 
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
tell us um
 
00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes when people put on the spot a
 
00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
little bit they get a little a little
 
00:49:30.319 --> 00:49:31.750 align:start position:0%
little bit they get a little a little
more

00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:49:34.589 --> 00:49:34.599 align:start position:0%
focused but if it was active that and
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
then something
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
happened yeah maybe we just a little
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
nudge to get them going again instead of
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
you know killing it you'll get them
 
00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
active you start publishing minutes
 
00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:50.200 align:start position:0%
again right okay uh this being done
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%

00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
Retreat because we're going to have to
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
invite you to come in
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%

00:51:17.309 --> 00:51:17.319 align:start position:0%
other this one okay with you Jim the
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
the the 17th is the last day to okay so
 
00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
I think the 13th would be good idea
 
00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:43.720 align:start position:0%
because we could review what's what's
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
going to be addressed in that retained
 
00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
sure session do we do we need to invite
 
00:51:51.069 --> 00:51:51.079 align:start position:0%
anybody from the committee or you think

00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
for the uh for the 30th that we'll
 
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:08.319 align:start position:0%

00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
dlan excuse me when Jen just mentioned
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
which is something we need to consider
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
as your this retained bill is going to
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
be amended it is going to change it and
 
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
with the speaker's um designation it
 
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
would be a non- derain Amendment so you
 
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
would have to have a public hearing on a
 
00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:35.720 align:start position:0%
non- derain Amendment no we or would the
 
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
let's let
 
00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
add so so so are you prepared to do that
 
00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:43.160 align:start position:0%

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:44.630 align:start position:0%
or is this enough time to get that uh
notice

00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%

00:52:47.069 --> 00:52:47.079 align:start position:0%
out well we have enough time to get it
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
out um if we're
 
00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
GNA it would have to be a public hearing
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
and then an exec session after the 13
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
so either the 14th 15th or 16th of
 
00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
November okay yeah yeah you can have the
 
00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
N just before you accept it anyway we'll
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
need we'll need the amendment number
 
00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
because put the proper notification in
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
the calendar we need the amendment
 
00:53:10.789 --> 00:53:10.799 align:start position:0%
number so it'll have to be drafted ahead
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
of time so that means we would have to
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%

00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%

committee theist the the list of
 
00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:51.160 align:start position:0%
commissions that we're going to repeal
 
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
through S
 
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
sp84 and that's something we we could
 
00:53:59.230 --> 00:53:59.240 align:start position:0%
formulate here and the list right but we
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
need to we need to give them something
 
00:54:04.589 --> 00:54:04.599 align:start position:0%

that we we know what I think it's
 
00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
important for us just to know what the
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
mechanics are so that we we don't fudge
 
00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
this uh let's invite representative uh
 
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%

amendment OS will do the amendment but
 
00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
Jen for is here who's the researcher for
 
00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration so she'll be
 
00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
working we'll we'll work with repres she
 
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
and it's like we do with any um standing
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
committee should we have at next meeting
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
the 30th just give the heads up
 
00:54:58.670 --> 00:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
I I still couldn't
 
00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:01.640 align:start position:0%
hearon have him here at the 30th meeting
 
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
we could but this is just like any else
 
00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
that we would do you normally wouldn't
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
we can but he doesn't usually come in to
 
00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
that's just a question in your in your I
 
00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
don't think it would be NE necessary to
 
00:55:14.069 --> 00:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
Dave here I don't think Dave would need
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
to be here I know he's they're busy so
 
00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:21.160 align:start position:0%
and in our meeting notices for for the
 
00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
30th that we we'll publish will cover us
 
00:55:26.109 --> 00:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
for you know being able to talk about we
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
don't need to have a public hearing no
 
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
no it's because legislative
 
00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
Administration has possession of s sp84
 
00:55:34.829 --> 00:55:34.839 align:start position:0%
which is going to be the
 
00:55:34.839 --> 00:55:40.069 align:start position:0%
which is going to be the
vehicle

00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:42.520 align:start position:0%

just you know I offered to take it cuz I
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
thought there wasn't going to be any
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
work involved and now it seems like
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
there might be more work involved no no
 
00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:01.079 align:start position:0%

comments or worries yeah um
 
00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:13.960 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan one of the items
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
that I just want to mention that we gave
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
a copy to the lsrs establishing a
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
committee or commission this is what's
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
coming up for
 
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
2024 and what we're doing in house
 
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
Services as we are looking each one up
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
we did leave notes right now where
 
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
there's a duplication so if there's a
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
similar commission that in existence or
 
00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
how many times the same item may have
 
00:56:40.829 --> 00:56:40.839 align:start position:0%
come up we're going to be putting in the
 
00:56:43.029 --> 00:56:43.039 align:start position:0%
um farri column that's why we're calling
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
it a draft right now so um you you can
 
00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:49.480 align:start position:0%
just look at this and see what we have
 
00:56:52.589 --> 00:56:52.599 align:start position:0%
to date and we will have more for you by
 
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
the next um meeting like for instance
 
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
since um we have establishing an
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
independent redistri commission I
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
believe that legislation's come up four
 
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
or five times in the last several years
 
00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:05.720 align:start position:0%
but just so you have a history of it as
 
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
we're moving forward because these are
 
00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
all the
 
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
proposed committees or commissions for
 
00:57:14.829 --> 00:57:14.839 align:start position:0%
2024 and um there's total of 30 15 and
 
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
15 and then we just start adding the
 
00:57:20.829 --> 00:57:20.839 align:start position:0%
Senate collection so as you change
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
things over here they're still growing
 
00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:25.480 align:start position:0%
over here well let me ask uh ask you
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
guys you both of you uh about our
 
00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
process now these are all going to go to
 
00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
the speaker and um the clerk I guess to
 
00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:41.720 align:start position:0%
put their heads together to decide
 
00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:43.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not we're actually going to
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
have a committee or
 
00:57:48.029 --> 00:57:48.039 align:start position:0%
commission these are assigned to the
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
standing committees and it's Su standing
 
00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
committee that makes that decision just
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
like a regular bill but I mean it it
 
00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:55.720 align:start position:0%
could be that the speaker and the clerk
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
together could say this doesn't warrant
 
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
a committee or commission or it should
 
00:58:03.309 --> 00:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
be combined you know numbers three and
 
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
four and seven ought to be all combined
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
into one is that do they make that
 
00:58:10.589 --> 00:58:10.599 align:start position:0%
decision at at at their level no so
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
these will work just like any other bill
 
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
that comes forward the speaker and clerk
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
work together to assign them to the
 
00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate policy committee policy
 
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
committee works with it but the the
 
00:58:22.829 --> 00:58:22.839 align:start position:0%
speaker and clerk don't change any bills
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
I got crap I stand up I notic one of our
 
00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
members is putting in two
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
commissions well I was going to say you
 
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
know there are several that if you want
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
to try and dissuade a member you know
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
from signing off on on a study committee
 
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
or commission feel free except for those
 
00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:49.240 align:start position:0%

00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
say that come on you know that I'm
 
00:58:52.109 --> 00:58:52.119 align:start position:0%
looking forward to a robust debate on
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
that in our second second year of the
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%

01:00:05.029 --> 01:00:05.039 align:start position:0%
never put this together like this um in
 
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
