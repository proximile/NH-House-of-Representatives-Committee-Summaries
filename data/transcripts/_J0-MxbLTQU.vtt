I would like to welcome everybody to

committee we're looking forward to uh
 
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
hearing any questions you have and being
 
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
can I heard that you all met already
 
00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
commission with us being further north
 
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
we um we actually use the North Atlantic
 
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
that we talk about more often and that's
 
00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 align:start position:0%
a different commission but they work the
 
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
same so it's the same sort of situation
 
00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
with them making federal laws that
 
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
do um give us governance uh and
 
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 align:start position:0%

of New Hampshire I live abing the state
 
00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
of Vermont and very very close to the
 
00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.309 align:start position:0%
of Vermont and very very close to the
Canadian

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
Canadian
 
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
you with that if uh you'd like we can
 
00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 align:start position:0%
kick it off to you to uh ask any
 
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
questions um I will tell you that uh we
 
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of impact
 
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
on um poaching commercially of fish in
 
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we govern what we do here
 
00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 align:start position:0%
just the state waters and most of that
 
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
is uh laws that govern um the landing of
 
00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919 align:start position:0%
fish um the landing of of lobsters crabs
 
00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:55.950 align:start position:0%
fish um the landing of of lobsters crabs
and

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 align:start position:0%
such um regulations about uh what kind
 
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
of gear can be used while fishing within
 
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 align:start position:0%
those state
 
00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 align:start position:0%
waters um outside of the state waters we
 
00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 align:start position:0%
have federal waters those are governed
 
00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:13.879 align:start position:0%
by um the federal laws not the state
 
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
laws and uh and then beyond that of
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
waters and with that I'll let your
 
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
moderator decide who gets to ask the
 
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.120 align:start position:0%
first questions or what's a topic of
 
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
importance that one of us might be able
 
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:58.280 align:start position:0%
that's a good question um we do not have
 
00:07:59.909 --> 00:07:59.919 align:start position:0%
term limits in New Hampshire because we
 
00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
are a volunteer legislature we are
 
00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:04.759 align:start position:0%
actually uh 400 in number in the state
 
00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
house and 24 in the
 
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
Senate uh we also have an executive
 
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:11.560 align:start position:0%
Council made up of five and the governor
 
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
himself and all of us run every two
 
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
years so the entire government could
 
00:08:17.869 --> 00:08:17.879 align:start position:0%
turn over every two
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
years um because there's so many of us
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
as a citizen legislature and we are
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
actually number three in size in the
 
00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
democratically elected English-speaking
 
00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:30.589 align:start position:0%
democratically elected English-speaking
world

00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
world
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
behind our own federal government and
 
00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:37.479 align:start position:0%
the House of Commons in
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
England um that puts our representation
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
very close to the people and we have to
 
00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:44.039 align:start position:0%
do a good job or they're going to kick
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
us out on top of that
 
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
um we we have high turnover I think
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
about the the numbers average about
 
00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
onethird of the house doesn't come back
 
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
every election cycle so uh it's just one
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
of those those things where at some
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
point someone will make a decision that
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
they are done and they don't want to run
 
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
anymore because it's a lot of work to do
 
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
and we only get paid $100 a year for it
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
and that's before taxes so this isn't a
 
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
career we don't get paid large amounts
 
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
of money for being here and there's no
 
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:19.240 align:start position:0%
in incentive for us to make a career out
 
00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
of it uh what we do we do simply because
 
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:24.200 align:start position:0%
we want to make things better and be
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
able to volunteer to help our state out
 
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
with its
 
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
governance and
 
00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:32.360 align:start position:0%
I'll let uh each person answer in their
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
own to the same question if anybody's
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
got anything to
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
add quite question
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
but oh ter liament um I I really think
 
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire uh government is is
 
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
representative of how the founding
 
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
fathers wanted it to be set up they
 
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
wanted us to be even at the federal
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
level citizen legislators who left the
 
00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
private sector went and served the
 
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
people for a short period of time and
 
00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
then went back to the private sector um
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think the founding fathers ever
 
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
meant for Washington to become what it
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
may have become which is a full-time job
 
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
and so I think New Hampshire is probably
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
very close to what our founding fathers
 
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.069 align:start position:0%
very close to what our founding fathers
really

00:10:17.069 --> 00:10:17.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
wanted sure I would add just a little
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
more to to what they said and I think
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
that uh this is only my second year here
 
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
but I've seen that because it's all
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
volunteer there's a real pride in the
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
people that are here to to serve the
 
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
people of the state and as a volunteer
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
and it's really it's an honor to be here
 
00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:41.150 align:start position:0%
and it's really it's an honor to be here
truly

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
is I agree it is an honor but it is a
 
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
tremendous commitment uh a lot of the
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
representatives live uh quite a ways
 
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
away as myself it's almost 3 hours uh
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
driving time to come here and uh so you
 
00:10:57.389 --> 00:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
have to be dedicated at the same time
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
you have to be looking at the big
 
00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
picture that you really want to help
 
00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
your constituents and do what's right
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
for your area so it is uh uh we take a
 
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
do I am wudi Baki kuruma from the Civil
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
Society organization of serun now the
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
question I would like to ask about this
 
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
the election of this legislative in a
 
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
situation we are in the American
 
00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:32.519 align:start position:0%
politics is being navigated by two
 
00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
political parties like Democrats and
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
Republicans how do you go about the
 
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
election of your local
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
legislations is this on partisan basis
 
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:54.230 align:start position:0%
legislations is this on partisan basis
or

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
so it is and when this house finishes
 
00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:05.079 align:start position:0%
its elections there will be a certain
 
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
number of the house members who are
 
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
Democrats and a certain number who are
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
Republicans um we're not showing you
 
00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:13.079 align:start position:0%
that division right now because everyone
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
who showed up today here is is
 
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
Republican um
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
but currently our house is evenly
 
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
divided we only have a majority of about
 
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
three Republicans at the moment so all
 
00:12:29.189 --> 00:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
of these committees are set up to
 
00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
represent the entire body in numbers so
 
00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:35.079 align:start position:0%
my committee has 10 Republicans and 10
 
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
Democrats on it that makes up the 20
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
that sit here normally to do our
 
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
committee work when we look at laws they
 
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:45.160 align:start position:0%
may be submitted by either side what
 
00:12:47.069 --> 00:12:47.079 align:start position:0%
we're looking at is what's best for the
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
state sometimes politics plays into that
 
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
this committee not so much because we
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
are uh less of a controversial or or
 
00:12:59.949 --> 00:12:59.959 align:start position:0%
very partisan committee uh when we make
 
00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
a decision on a law it's typically
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
because it's having to do with the
 
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
management of our wildlife and both
 
00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
sides usually agree on
 
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
that um and
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
so other things that we deal with in the
 
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
house can be very partisan um the
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
laws as they come forward can be very
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
slanted one side or the other and then
 
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
you get fights over them but I think
 
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
that this committee is one where uh
 
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
typically you get more of a um
 
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.550 align:start position:0%
typically you get more of a um
discussion

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:35.240 align:start position:0%
over people who might be more leaning
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
towards anti-hunting anti-fishing more
 
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
animal rights versus people who are
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
hunters and fishermen and and um looking
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
out for the the fishing industry and and
 
00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
uh our hunting tourism and and that sort
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
of thing so uh that tends to be the
 
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
conservationist and animal rights versus
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
the Sportsman's rights and Commercial
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
rights and I think I would it there and
 
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
add yeah I think that today because we
 
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
are so um close in numbers we are more
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
partisan and than maybe um or
 
00:14:15.749 --> 00:14:15.759 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan I should say than than maybe
 
00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
we normally are uh because in order to
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
get any legislation through we have to
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
work together uh there's no way one side
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
can can rule the house and and say this
 
00:14:27.069 --> 00:14:27.079 align:start position:0%
is the way it's going to be because we
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
don't have the numbers to do that and uh
 
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:33.160 align:start position:0%
so to some extent this creates you know
 
00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
an even house creates a nonpartisan
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
environment because just you have to
 
00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:38.959 align:start position:0%
have that in order to legislate when we
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
have a stronger majority we might be
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
more part tend to be more partisan
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
because we don't need the other side to
 
00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:49.350 align:start position:0%
because we don't need the other side to
pass

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
legislation one thing I found being on
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
the committee it's very very interesting
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
like myself I live up north I live in
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
the mountains and being part of this
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
committee I've got a a great education
 
00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
on how our Sea Coast works and our
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
commercial fishermen which I've never
 
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
had any exposure to so as we work
 
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
together it's very interesting it's
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
educational very quickly I would add
 
00:15:18.189 --> 00:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
that there there there is uh an
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
independent party third party it's it's
 
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
for those people that don't want to be
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
over here or over here and they kind of
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
in the middle more of the times it's a
 
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
very small number of people and they
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
they don't have any they don't really
 
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
have much sway as a group I don't even
 
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
how many we have three or four maybe
 
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
currently we only have two or three okay
 
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
okay um so there there is that option to
 
00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
be a a a third party but it's uh it's
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
generally not going to get you anywhere
 
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
to do that and when we run for
 
00:15:54.189 --> 00:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
election I will say that there has not
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
been success in this state for people to
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
run as a third party and get elected um
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
everyone who is currently an independent
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
in the house became that after they were
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
already elected and they just decided
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to be part of either
 
00:16:10.639 --> 00:16:11.550 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to be part of either
party

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
anymore they dropped out of the other
 
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
parties and declared that they were
 
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
independent when we run for reelection
 
00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
which is coming up very
 
00:16:23.309 --> 00:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
soon we sign up as either a Republican
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
or a Democrat you could sign up as an
 
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
independent but whenever someone's done
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
that in the past they don't end up
 
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
getting enough votes and they just don't
 
00:16:32.829 --> 00:16:32.839 align:start position:0%
they don't end up in the house so we do
 
00:16:35.069 --> 00:16:35.079 align:start position:0%
have a situation here where those small
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
numbers of people who are independent
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
tend to run as one party or the other
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
and then declare that they're
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:20.890 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:54.549 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:01.690 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:12.260 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:12.270 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:20.390 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:21.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question that's a
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
good one um we did not actually mention
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
yet our Department of Fish and Game and
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
Marine Resources which is what we're
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
here to actually do our entire focus of
 
00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:34.919 align:start position:0%
this committee is to
 
00:18:34.919 --> 00:18:36.710 align:start position:0%
this committee is to
shape

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
shape
 
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
renew abolish if needed the laws that
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
they work to enforce so the Department
 
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
of Fish and Game and Marine
 
00:18:50.149 --> 00:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
Resources is made up of um people who
 
00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:53.720 align:start position:0%
who deal with the licensing aspect but
 
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
then also those enforcement
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
officers and we have uh enforcement on
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
our Sea Coast where they enforce our uh
 
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
laws regarding commercial fishering
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
fishing commercial uh crab and lobster
 
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
and then also the Sportsman fishing on
 
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
the Sea
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
Coast on the mainland and up in the
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
mountains we have a lot of enforcement
 
00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
officers that deal with hunting uh
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
whether it be big game small game um the
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
the use of uh allterrain vehicles uh
 
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
four-wheelers and snowmobiles and other
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
things that we use to drive because
 
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
those are not on a road they're not
 
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
enforced by the police they're enforced
 
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
by the fish and game officers so any
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
laws that we've put in place that govern
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
how those Vehicles can be operated on
 
00:19:52.029 --> 00:19:52.039 align:start position:0%
trails in woods Fields Etc are enforced
 
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
by that department so our our fish and
 
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
game department is
 
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
um extensive but we obviously need more
 
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
people than we have because we have a
 
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
lot of land mass in New Hampshire and
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the current number is
 
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
one of these guys might be able to pitch
 
00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:11.799 align:start position:0%
in with it but uh we have we have a
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
number of fishing game officers on staff
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
now that are spread out around the state
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
some of them dealing only with those
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
Inland areas um I forgot to mention
 
00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
Inland we have fishing in The Lakes so
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
they're also not just doing the hunting
 
00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:26.679 align:start position:0%
and the trails but they're doing the
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
freshwater fishing as opposed to the
 
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
Marine fishing in the
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
ocean uh then we've got our boats and
 
00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
our crews out on the ocean that are
 
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
doing the enforcement and the checking
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
when a commercial boat comes in to make
 
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
sure this they're complying with laws
 
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
Etc and of course some of the what we
 
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
enforce on our Sea Coast for that
 
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
commercial is governed by federal law so
 
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
they're working under both state law and
 
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
federal law when they when they are
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
working with
 
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
that um and with that I'll pass it along
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
again yeah I would just add that um
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
though fishing game takes the lead on
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
that enforcement any of our Law
 
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers whether that be
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
State Police local Police or Sheriffs uh
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
have the power to enforce those laws as
 
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
well so if they were to see something
 
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:19.400 align:start position:0%
that they thought was a Miss they could
 
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
notify fishing game and and hold those
 
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
people until fishing game arrived to
 
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
make the final decision on whether or
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
not they had uh broken a regulation or a
 
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:34.950 align:start position:0%
not they had uh broken a regulation or a
law

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
I believe uh our current number of of
 
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
conservation officers in the field right
 
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
now is 46 and uh they're looking to
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
increase it by a few um one uh thing
 
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
that they do that um doesn't get a lot
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
of uh accolades is we uh hiking in the
 
00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
in the mountains is very very good sport
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
and we have a lot of people from
 
00:21:54.269 --> 00:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
Southern New England that come uh
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of people
 
00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:58.360 align:start position:0%
throughout the year and they lead up all
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
um rescue and lost hiker rescues um at
 
00:22:07.149 --> 00:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
no charge as part of their program uh so
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a big part of the safety
 
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
them listening to
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
you uh I was told I think that you have
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
met Federal representatives from the
 
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
National Oceanic and Atmospheric
 
00:22:23.269 --> 00:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
Administration from
 
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
Noah and from the US Coast Guard so Noah
 
00:22:29.789 --> 00:22:29.799 align:start position:0%
does not have an enforc ment Branch but
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
the Coast Guard as you know has an
 
00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement branch and they are
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for certain issues on the
 
00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
coast uh by federal law they're
 
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
responsible for environmental issues oil
 
00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
spills hazardous waste bills within a
 
00:22:47.269 --> 00:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
certain distance of the
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
shoreline um the New Hampshire
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services so
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that you all have slightly
 
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
different breakdowns of of uh of the
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions that are
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
Forest the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services handles water
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
quality um illegal discharges to to
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
rivers and streams and to the ocean and
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
that type of thing but we do not have an
 
00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.549 align:start position:0%
that type of thing but we do not have an
environmental

00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
environmental
 
00:23:15.269 --> 00:23:15.279 align:start position:0%
police they have to follow those up with
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
civil basically Court actions to to
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
manage that so the Coast Guard is our
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
basically they they obviously have a law
 
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:43.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:50.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.350 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:57.430 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:26.669 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:24:26.669 --> 00:24:26.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
so to recap the question because you
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
didn't get to hear it um and I'm sorry
 
00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not doing that last time uh he's
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
wondering about the breakdown of the
 
00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:35.799 align:start position:0%
parties and if the political parties
 
00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:37.350 align:start position:0%
parties and if the political parties
have

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:24:42.269 --> 00:24:42.279 align:start position:0%
um if they contest and and um argue over
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
the allocation of the resources for the
 
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
the um fishing and and and that type of
 
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
thing and for example uh you know shrimp
 
00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
comes in underneath the um the fishing
 
00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799 align:start position:0%
and um do we have specific laws that
 
00:24:59.230 --> 00:24:59.240 align:start position:0%
deal with the baking of shrimp and
 
00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:09.389 --> 00:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
it we have we do tend to have a
 
00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:12.200 align:start position:0%
breakdown in the political
 
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:17.240 align:start position:0%
parties for some of what gets allocated
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
for this the laws that this committee is
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
is responsible for as I said we tend to
 
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
be a fairly bipartisan party but if you
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
had to break it down I I think that the
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
Republican party you would find is more
 
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.549 align:start position:0%
Republican party you would find is more
Pro

00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
Pro
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
business um trying to take and and be
 
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
behind those commercial fisheries and
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
fishermen to make sure they can make a
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
living and make uh the best use of our
 
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:49.640 align:start position:0%
resource for um commercial purposes and
 
00:25:51.389 --> 00:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
for business purposes so that people
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
have a livelihood and in
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
income um on the Democrat side they
 
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
would tend to break down more on the
 
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
animal rights issues um the restriction
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
on Commercial Fishing uh the restriction
 
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
on methods of fishing to make it more
 
00:26:10.389 --> 00:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
fair for the animal being
 
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
caught um and less concern about the
 
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.350 align:start position:0%
caught um and less concern about the
actual

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
actual
 
00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:18.919 align:start position:0%
industry and I would sum it up that way
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
I think on the breakdown so if we have a
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
law for example on that might come
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
forward um that says we're going to
 
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
restrict the way that somebody can fish
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
for blue fish off of our sea
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
Coastline it might get a little
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
contentious between parties because you
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
might have um the Democrat side saying
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
um they want to protect the Bluefish and
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to restrict the use of
 
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
certain types of
 
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
Nets whereas we would be saying what's
 
00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
the evidence that there's any harm being
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
done by these
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
nets we want to protect the industries
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
that are depending on those blue fish to
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
be brought in and it's it's a balancing
 
00:27:00.669 --> 00:27:00.679 align:start position:0%
act we want to try to protect of course
 
00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
the resource because without the
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
resource there won't be an industry in
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
the future but at the same time we don't
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
want to so restrict the industry that
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
they cannot make a living doing it um we
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
don't have a shrimp industry up this far
 
00:27:17.549 --> 00:27:17.559 align:start position:0%
north to the best of my knowledge the
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
shrimp are more of a warm water species
 
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
we have main
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
lobster I don't know if you guys have
 
00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:27.039 align:start position:0%
been able to have any Lobster while you
 
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
were here but Main Lobster is a
 
00:27:30.269 --> 00:27:30.279 align:start position:0%
different species than that southern
 
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:32.200 align:start position:0%
Lobster that they have down in Florida
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
and whatnot and it's much better it's a
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
cold water
 
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
species um we also have
 
00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
crab but to the best of my knowledge
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
there's no shrimp industry up here um
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
and I hope I caught enough answer for
 
00:27:48.669 --> 00:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
everything there but I will pass it
 
00:27:48.679 --> 00:27:49.909 align:start position:0%
everything there but I will pass it
along

00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
along
 
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
now I I hope that I'm answering your
 
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
question but if there is contention and
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
so say fishing game committee comes to
 
00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:00.919 align:start position:0%
agreement and we pass it out of
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
committee and then we bring it to the
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
house floor there may be disagreement
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
there and and so even there that we
 
00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:10.519 align:start position:0%
manag to get agreement and we pass it
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
through the house it then has to go to
 
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.950 align:start position:0%
through the house it then has to go to
the

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
Senate and there's 24 Senators who have
 
00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:20.919 align:start position:0%
to agree that it's a good law and when
 
00:28:23.549 --> 00:28:23.559 align:start position:0%
they pass it it then goes to the
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
governor and he has to sign it or he can
 
00:28:29.549 --> 00:28:29.559 align:start position:0%
veto it and stop the law as well so
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
there there's quite a few steps to
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
actually get a law onto the books and
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
then if the governor does veto it we
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
have the ability to override his be veto
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
but it takes a much larger vote than the
 
00:28:42.159 --> 00:28:44.710 align:start position:0%
but it takes a much larger vote than the
simple

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.389 --> 00:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
majority representative
 
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
wette when we talk about politics and
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
contention it always seems to be the
 
00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:55.799 align:start position:0%
factor of money that's involved now
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
fishing game department in the state of
 
00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is self funded through the
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
hunters and Fisherman's licenses it
 
00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
takes very very little State money to
 
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
run this department the hunters and
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
fishermen support this uh uh Department
 
00:29:13.389 --> 00:29:13.399 align:start position:0%
fund it so the the department has an
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
obligation of course to to do what's
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
best to um manage their Wildlife and
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
Fish but at the same time to uh work
 
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
with conservation to make sure that the
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
okay that's an easy one
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
um when we run for reelection if we get
 
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
reelected we get sworn in in January of
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
the next year so for example this summer
 
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
we will be running elections in November
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
we will have those
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
elections in December this term of the
 
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
current members ends and in January we
 
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
start a brand new term with new all the
 
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:44.200 align:start position:0%
new members sworn in and at that point
 
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
when they're sworn in they get a check
 
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
for $200 to cover their two years you
 
00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
don't get anything extra for the
 
00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
committee you do get reimbursed for
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
mileage to drive here so someone like
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
representative ulette who's driving
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
three hours gets a larger amount of
 
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
money because he has to spend it all to
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
get down here
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
um and we do have some special
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
situations where there's some discounts
 
00:31:13.629 --> 00:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
at the local hotels so if we had a lot
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
of days in a row representative ulette
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
might decide he's going to stay here
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
rather than drive all the way back and
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
forth and part of his mileage could
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
cover his hotel stay to make sure he's
 
00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
he's here for all of our time um so
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
there's no no extra for being in the
 
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:31.240 align:start position:0%
committee the Speaker of the House gets
 
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
an extra $50 and the president of the
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
Senate gets an extra $50 but the Senate
 
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
and the house are both paid the same
 
00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
even though there's only 24 of them and
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
there's 400 of us we all only earn that
 
00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
$100 a year and that's before they take
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
out of committee or to put it better how
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
do you work with other law enforcement
 
00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:02.590 align:start position:0%
do you work with other law enforcement
AG

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
we don't have prosecution powers in the
 
00:32:09.389 --> 00:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
committee fish and game has prosecution
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
powers and their prosecution powers are
 
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
the same as any other law enforcement
 
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
officer in the state in fact they take
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
the same training they graduate from the
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
same courses it's just a different
 
00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
department for them to go into where
 
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
they then specialize in the huge amount
 
00:32:30.269 --> 00:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
of laws that we have for fishing game um
 
00:32:30.279 --> 00:32:32.149 align:start position:0%
of laws that we have for fishing game um
in

00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:32:34.509 --> 00:32:34.519 align:start position:0%
fact reptor do you think you can grab
 
00:32:36.269 --> 00:32:36.279 align:start position:0%
one of our Fish and Game books from the
 
00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
uh from the office so we can show them
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
how thick how thick the law book
 
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
is um they specialize in learning every
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
law regarding commercial and
 
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
recreational fishing hiking
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
four-wheeling everything that's in there
 
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
they specialize on that after they've
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
decided to become part of that
 
00:32:59.629 --> 00:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
department department but they undergo
 
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
the same basic training and they have
 
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
the same prosecution ability the same
 
00:33:06.509 --> 00:33:06.519 align:start position:0%
arresting ability and um and then our
 
00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
regular court system handles it just as
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
they do anything else we don't have a
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
either you can pass that around and let
 
00:33:19.629 --> 00:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
everybody take a look at
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
that and so at that point now I'll let
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative oulette answer as far as
 
00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.750 align:start position:0%
representative oulette answer as far as
the

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
prosecution represent Spain is correct
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
fishing game themselves the department
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
does that we have no power but if
 
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
there's something that changes in the
 
00:33:37.149 --> 00:33:37.159 align:start position:0%
industry or in the sport and they need
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
new laws to do prosecution and to handle
 
00:33:42.629 --> 00:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
their job that's where they come to us
 
00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%
to say hey we need this law changed
 
00:33:47.789 --> 00:33:47.799 align:start position:0%
they'll bring it to us as a committee
 
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
we'll look at it maybe change it maybe
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
not vote on it take it to the floor and
 
00:33:54.669 --> 00:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
try to get the law changed to give them
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
the tools to do the job that they
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
need and I can add on to that by giving
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
you some examples that we just did this
 
00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
year so this year um the federal
 
00:34:07.829 --> 00:34:07.839 align:start position:0%
government made a change last December
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
on the issuance of water fowl hunting
 
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
stamps now in the United States
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
migratory water fowl are governed by the
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
federal laws not a state law because
 
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
they travel across many states so the
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
federal law governs all hunting of them
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
and what laws can be in place we have
 
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
State LA laws that mimic those federal
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
laws so that they're enforceable within
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
our state but they're the ones who tell
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
us what it has to be for those so one of
 
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
the things they do with Federal water
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
fowl is in order to fund their program
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
they force everybody who plans to hunt
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
them to buy a tax stamp and it used to
 
00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
be for many years
 
00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
well for as long as the program's been
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
in in place until last year you got a
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
physical stamp that you had to sign your
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
name across and carry with you while
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
were hunting water foul and last
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
December the federal government decided
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to go with electronic ones
 
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
that just get sent to your phone and you
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
just have to show them the stamp stamp
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
on your phone and our law said you had
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
to sign that stamp and carry it with you
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
so we had to change our law because they
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't enforce the federal law with
 
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
the way our law was written and they
 
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
couldn't enforce our law when the
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
federal law said we're not giving you a
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
stamp anymore people would have no stamp
 
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
so we had to pass that one and that was
 
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
again there was no partisan issue there
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
everybody agreed we've got to do this so
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
that we are in line and it can be
 
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
example in my first term here I've been
 
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
I've been very pleased with the demeanor
 
00:35:53.589 --> 00:35:53.599 align:start position:0%
of all of the representatives that come
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
here to conquer occasionally you have an
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
issue but what you don't see here is
 
00:36:03.069 --> 00:36:03.079 align:start position:0%
what you see on CNN or or any other
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
major Network about the challenging
 
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
hearings that happen in the US House of
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
Representatives and the Senate we don't
 
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
challenge people here we don't fight
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
with anyone that's sitting at this table
 
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
we're here to listen and I'm really
 
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
pleased that that's how it works in New
 
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one of
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
the uh one of the things that we can do
 
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
as members
 
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
is we generally have direct contact with
 
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
a a head of an agency so the director of
 
00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
fishing game or the commissioner of an
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
agency so although we don't have
 
00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:41.720 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial Powers we do have the
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
ability to pass our constituents
 
00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:46.839 align:start position:0%
concerns directly to the head of an
 
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
agency and maybe have it taken care of
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
I will speak in
 
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:13.610 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:24.390 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:56.589 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:37:56.589 --> 00:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:56.599 --> 00:38:05.829 align:start position:0%
 
Secret

00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.829 --> 00:38:26.839 align:start position:0%
agreement another another really great
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
question and I'm going to explain the
 
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
laws what's in the law book that you saw
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
has rules and
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
laws our Department of Fish and Game and
 
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
Marine Resources the director of that
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
department has the ability to do certain
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
things under rules which happen much
 
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
faster than passing a law and we gave
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
them that ability because we have so
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
many many things that change constantly
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
as far as um hunting seasons fishing
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
Seasons the number of fish that can be
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
taken these things happen fast and it
 
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
might take a lot longer for a law to get
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
passed than the rule can be
 
00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:15.750 align:start position:0%
passed than the rule can be
changed

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
so within the fishing game department
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
the director may get biological data
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
from his employees that says we need to
 
00:39:28.109 --> 00:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
decrease the number of trout being taken
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
this year in our freshwater areas
 
00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
because we've had a decrease in their
 
00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
numbers and we don't want people to take
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
too many or it could be something where
 
00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
the federal government has decided that
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
we can't take as many of a certain type
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
of fish off our Shoreline or we may have
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
even decided we need to decrease the
 
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
number of lobsters being
 
00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:51.640 align:start position:0%
taken uh it can also work with game uh
 
00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
such as right now we have a large an
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
ever increasing population of turkeys so
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
recently they have changed the rules for
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
the turkey hunting season to allow you
 
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
to take two turkeys this spring instead
 
00:40:08.589 --> 00:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
of just one like you could in the past
 
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
and you can still hunt one turkey in the
 
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
fall um but they've decided that there's
 
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
so many they need to take more of them
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
if they can so they're letting people
 
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
hunt more of them uh many many years ago
 
00:40:22.589 --> 00:40:22.599 align:start position:0%
the turkey was endangered so you weren't
 
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to take any at all so we've had
 
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
a very successful program of bringing
 
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
the turkey back back so successful now
 
00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079 align:start position:0%
that they are just everywhere and we're
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
going to be trying to balance that out
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
by allowing them to be taken more so a
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
rule is governed entirely by the
 
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
director and the fishing Game Commission
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
which is a group of elected well
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor members from
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
all around the state I think there's 11
 
00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
of them I think so 11 members sit on
 
00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
this commission they represent districts
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
up north where rep ulette is they
 
00:41:02.589 --> 00:41:02.599 align:start position:0%
represent districts down here where I am
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
and there's a special one the number 11
 
00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:07.079 align:start position:0%
is Sea Coast only that governs fisheries
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
and things on the Sea Coast so every
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
area gets representation on the fishing
 
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:12.990 align:start position:0%
area gets representation on the fishing
Game

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
Game
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
Commission so when the director goes to
 
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
set rules the commission votes on that
 
00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
and if the commission representing all
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
of the state agrees there's two public
 
00:41:27.309 --> 00:41:27.319 align:start position:0%
hearings on it somewhere in the state
 
00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:29.720 align:start position:0%
the public gets to have an input but
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
then all of that stuff is set down into
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
the rules and that makes up for the next
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
hunting and fishing season so that it's
 
00:41:41.069 --> 00:41:41.079 align:start position:0%
done every year uh any major changes go
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
through that process we don't have to
 
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
take care of that in law because it it
 
00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
just wouldn't get done um but we have to
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
shape the laws that
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
overall um
 
00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:57.640 align:start position:0%
govern the fishing game department and
 
00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
the commission such as uh and and with
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
our laws we're able to override the
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
commission so if the commission doesn't
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
think something is a good idea we can
 
00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
pass a law that says we don't care we
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
want to do it anyway um an example of
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
that would be a law I passed uh for so
 
00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
years ago that allowed the use of a
 
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
crossbow for hunting during the muzzle
 
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
loader season when you were only
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to use muzzle loading rifles
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
there was no impact to anything except
 
00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
that it gave people a different option
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
to use but the commission was opposed to
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
it they didn't want to allow it and we
 
00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
passed the law through the house and the
 
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
Senate and the governor signed it so now
 
00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
it's a law they have to craft rules to
 
00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
follow that law and that took longer to
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
do it can take an entire year or maybe
 
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
both years in a
 
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
session um or in a term I should say and
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
um so it could take one or two years
 
00:42:58.510 --> 00:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
typically if something goes longer than
 
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
two years you're now into a new elective
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
cycle so everything could get turned
 
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
upside down and it may not go anywhere
 
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:07.480 align:start position:0%
um so we try to get everything done if
 
00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
it's a law within one or two years but
 
00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
those rules can happen very
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
quickly and anybody else have anything
 
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
that just one more thing when we talk
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
about the fish and gaming Department you
 
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
know we've mentioned a lot about law
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement but they've got a whole
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
section in their Department of just
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
biologists who are studying our animal
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
habitat and our fisheries and um give
 
00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations on the laws and what
 
00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
should be changed and what we need to do
 
00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
them yeah the
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
um the biologists are the ones who give
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
the scientific data
 
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
guidance to the ru making and the law

variety of biologists who are constantly
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
studying that and that can even impact
 
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
things such as Housing

Timber all of these things might have an
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
impact that then has to be studied

see that one's a complicated one but
 
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
we'll get to it
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
yes so um we don't have a Ministry or a
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
parliament in the United States we are a
 
00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:23.670 align:start position:0%
parliament in the United States we are a
representative

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:25.640 align:start position:0%
Republic that means that we are a
 
00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
republic that's brought together
 
00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
together by a whole bunch of States who
 
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
agreed to enter into this Republic the
 
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.470 align:start position:0%
agreed to enter into this Republic the
federal

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
government governs
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
overarching laws defense of the nation
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
whole but a lot of power is invested in
 
00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
each individual
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
state within the states some of us run a
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
little differently but we all follow the
 
00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
same way without a parliament or without
 
00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:57.510 align:start position:0%
same way without a parliament or without
a

00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
Ministry every single position in our
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
state government is elected on its
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
own so it it doesn't matter if the
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
governor is Republican or Democrat that
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
Governor got
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
elected and that's his party or her
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
party the same is true with the
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
executive councel which is a check on
 
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
the balance of the governor the governor
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
cannot do everything that Governor wants
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
unless five the five members of the
 
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
executive Council agree with him a
 
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
majority of them for example appointing
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
someone to be director of Fish and Game
 
00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
he may make an appointment of someone to
 
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
be the director of this department but
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
the executive Council has to look at
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
that listen to have a hearing on that
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
and agree with him or else it doesn't
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
happen in the Senate and the house we
 
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
are a
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
we are equal but
 
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
separate the Senators have districts
 
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
that overlap hours so the same people
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
who are voting for us are voting for a
 
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
senator and a governor and an executive
 
00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.309 align:start position:0%
senator and a governor and an executive
council

00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
member they may not all be from the same
 
00:49:20.589 --> 00:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
party but we have to work together if
 
00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:22.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to get things
 
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
done so for example in my district I
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
have three towns I
 
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
cover in my hometown of Deerfield my
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
Senator that runs in my district his
 
00:49:38.589 --> 00:49:38.599 align:start position:0%
district uh is one area so currently
 
00:49:41.069 --> 00:49:41.079 align:start position:0%
that would be representative or Senator
 
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
Pearl in the next town over that I also
 
00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.589 align:start position:0%
Pearl in the next town over that I also
represent

00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
Candia I have a different Senate
 
00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:50.200 align:start position:0%
District overlaps that so I've got
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
Senator Murphy there and in my third
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
town I have yet another Senate District
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
because I live in a complicated area
 
00:50:01.789 --> 00:50:01.799 align:start position:0%
and I have Senator Carson over
 
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
there all three of them happen to be
 
00:50:05.789 --> 00:50:05.799 align:start position:0%
Republicans but it doesn't have to be
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
that way one of the towns could have
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
elected me as a republican but elected a
 
00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.069 --> 00:50:17.079 align:start position:0%
senator and so everything is elected at
 
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:18.440 align:start position:0%
its own
 
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
level and the way that things move
 
00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:23.960 align:start position:0%
through our body to get done is that
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
first we write some what's called a bill
 
00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
which is an idea for a
 
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
law in the house or the
 
00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
Senate all tax bills spending and money
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
bills need to originate by law in the
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
house not the
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
Senate because they're closer to the
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
people we have much more of a direct
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
interaction because there's 400 of us
 
00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:53.960 align:start position:0%
24 there's one of us for every 3,500
 
00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
people in the state so they figured
 
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
money has to be close to the people
 
00:50:59.390 --> 00:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
we're not going to let you tax people
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
unless they have a very direct say so we
 
00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
propose a
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
bill it comes to a committee like
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
this we have a public Hearing in this
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
committee where the makeup is split
 
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
between Republicans and Democrats based
 
00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
on how the election
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
went members of the public and special
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
interests and department heads can all
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
come in and testify to us on the bill we
 
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
listen to them we will at a later time
 
00:51:28.829 --> 00:51:28.839 align:start position:0%
have discussions among the committee
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
members on what we've heard from
 
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
testimony and make a vote if we decide
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
that that bill should proceed on it goes
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
to the house floor with an ought to pass
 
00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:41.240 align:start position:0%
or we think it's good motion if we think
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't go forward it goes to the
 
00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
house floor with a itl which means
 
00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate or we shouldn't
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
pass it
 
00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
motion I'm simplifying this a little bit
 
00:51:56.109 --> 00:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
but um once it passes the house it still
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
has to go to the Senate and the Senate
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
will bring it in front of a committee on
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
their side like this where they will
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
hear from the public and the department
 
00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
heads and
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
everybody they will make their
 
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
discussions and
 
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
determination and then it goes to the
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
senate floor if it passes the senate
 
00:52:14.829 --> 00:52:14.839 align:start position:0%
floor and it's the same as the bill
 
00:52:17.109 --> 00:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
passed the house it goes to the governor
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
the governor can choose to sign it or
 
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
not and that's how you have to go
 
00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
through to get the legislation done and
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
how we have to all work together any
 
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
anything that started in the Senate as a
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
bill still has to come to the house and
 
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
we have to pass it before it goes to the
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
governor so we're equal bodies we just
 
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
represent different areas of the state
 
00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
with different numbers and we still have
 
00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
to work together and so there's no
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
Parliament I would say for us the
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
parliament well like in in England they
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
have the Parliament and the House of
 
00:52:53.549 --> 00:52:53.559 align:start position:0%
Commons right house of House of Lords
 
00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
and the House of Commons make up the
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
parliament that's it so for your
 
00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:00.680 align:start position:0%
terminology Parliament equals
 
00:53:03.549 --> 00:53:03.559 align:start position:0%
legislature the House of Lords would be
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
the Senate and the House of Commons
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
would be those of us in the
 
00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.230 align:start position:0%
would be those of us in the
house

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
and we don't elect a speaker based on
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
Coalition of parties but we do have a
 
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
vote for who's going to run each of
 
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
those bodies um it's typically the
 
00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:25.160 align:start position:0%
majority who had seats in that body will
 
00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
elect their person to run that body so
 
00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
This this term we had slightly more
 
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
Republicans and we elected speaker
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
Packard to be our Speaker of the House
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
in the Senate they had slightly more
 
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
Republicans and they elected Senator Jeb
 
00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:43.839 align:start position:0%
Bradley to be the president of the
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
Senate and those two people are in
 
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
charge of keeping everybody in order
 
00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
keeping everything running the speaker
 
00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
on the house side and the Senate
 
00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
President on the Senate side and there
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who instill
 
00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:00.680 align:start position:0%
order and
 
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
decorum and
 
00:54:08.109 --> 00:54:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
add as representa Spain said in the
 
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
house our speaker of the house is was
 
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
elected is a gentleman named Sher
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
Packard when I was first elected to the
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
house we had the election I was very
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
much surprised that he was elected
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly um with a lot of
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
Democrats voting for this Republican
 
00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
speaker and that just showed that how
 
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
much respect there is for people who
 
00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:38.750 align:start position:0%
much respect there is for people who
work

00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
together so I I believe I've translated
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
your question from listening to the
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
Chairman's answer to
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
you um in the history of the United
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
States the idea of the House of of at
 
00:54:56.349 --> 00:54:56.359 align:start position:0%
the federal level the house of repres
 
00:54:59.549 --> 00:54:59.559 align:start position:0%
representatives and the Senate was
 
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
similar to English parliament in many
 
00:55:05.069 --> 00:55:05.079 align:start position:0%
ways the House of Lords and the House of
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
Commons the thought was in the founding
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
of the country that the House of
 
00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
Representatives was more of the Common
 
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
Man the farmer the worker and they
 
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
tended to be maybe a little more
 
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh controversial Rough Around the Edges
 
00:55:25.029 --> 00:55:25.039 align:start position:0%
controversial and the senators were
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
always supposed to be those that were
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
higher bred and could control themselves
 
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
and they could kind of temper what the
 
00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:36.680 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
did I we have grown far from that at
 
00:55:42.029 --> 00:55:42.039 align:start position:0%
this point and and basically the House
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
of Representatives and the Senate are
 
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
are people from all walks of life at
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
this point although some of those in
 
00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
certain positions do think they're
 
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
better than others still in this day and
 
00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
age but
 
00:55:59.710 --> 00:55:59.720 align:start position:0%
mhm yeah and just quickly there are
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
times when the house sends a bill to the
 
00:56:04.829 --> 00:56:04.839 align:start position:0%
Senate after we have approved it and the
 
00:56:08.109 --> 00:56:08.119 align:start position:0%
Senate changes it it then has to come
 
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
back to the house and we vote to uh
 
00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
either concur with their
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
change to no we're not interested in
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
what you've done non-c concur or we can
 
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
ask for a committee of conference where
 
00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
we will get together and try to work out
 
00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
a compromise
 
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:31.640 align:start position:0%
uh to pass the bill so that's the the
 
00:56:34.109 --> 00:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
other part of
 
00:56:34.119 --> 00:56:36.150 align:start position:0%
other part of
it

00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
yes now uh again W Kura again from seron
 
00:56:45.029 --> 00:56:45.039 align:start position:0%
now uh looking at the illegal unreported
 
00:56:47.549 --> 00:56:47.559 align:start position:0%
and unregulated Fisheries
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
activities that has now ped the threat
 
00:56:53.029 --> 00:56:53.039 align:start position:0%
towards the management of our fishies
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
resources I want to know in the first
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
place how does this
 
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
States take note of the mes size the
 
00:57:05.069 --> 00:57:05.079 align:start position:0%
area where people do the fishes
 
00:57:07.029 --> 00:57:07.039 align:start position:0%
activities and the method they use to
 
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
fish that is one and
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
secondly how which policies are using do
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
you have open access to these resources
 
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
or you have restrictive measures that
 
00:57:19.829 --> 00:57:19.839 align:start position:0%
you put in place like for my country is
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
an Open Access everybody can come to
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
there and do fishing without any
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
restriction then the last thing talking
 
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
about food security how this sector
 
00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
contribute to all food security now we
 
00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
know the exal which are the small scale
 
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
fishes their contribution towards this
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
particular aspect of food security which
 
00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
policies do you have at state level to
 
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
subsidize these people whether yearly or
 
00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
at any time you
 
00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
wish I'm going to do my best here
 
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
um we have
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
when it comes to restrictions for
 
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
fishing or for anything else um that's
 
00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:05.240 align:start position:0%
all done through licensing and
 
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
permitting so we do control because the
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
federal government also wants control
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
over the fisheries and the
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
resource um there was a
 
00:58:20.349 --> 00:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
time 12 or 15 years ago when anybody
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire could go and throw a
 
00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:24.200 align:start position:0%
fishing line into the ocean and fish
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
with no license needed because the ocean
 
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
was different if they wanted to do it in
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
freshwat they needed a license or a
 
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
permit but not the ocean but the federal
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
government wanted us to start
 
00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
restricting more of that so now you need
 
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
to buy a fishing license even to fish in
 
00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:41.190 align:start position:0%
to buy a fishing license even to fish in
the

00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:44.589 --> 00:58:44.599 align:start position:0%
ocean we have multiple aspects of
 
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
that you have the what we consider sport
 
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
fishermen which is fishing for your own
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
use it may not really be sport it may be
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
for your food but you're fishing for
 
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
your own own use you're not selling it
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
and then we have commercial
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
fishermen who are fishing because
 
00:59:04.829 --> 00:59:04.839 align:start position:0%
they're bringing it in to sell
 
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:07.640 align:start position:0%
it they're licensed differently and
 
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
they're monitored and controlled
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
differently um there's much less
 
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
regulation around a sport
 
00:59:20.549 --> 00:59:20.559 align:start position:0%
fisherman because they're taking in less
 
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
fish um but there's still restrictions
 
00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
on types of gear that can be used used
 
00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:29.240 align:start position:0%
some of these things come down from
 
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
federal law such as no use of Gil Nets
 
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.549 align:start position:0%
federal law such as no use of Gil Nets
um

00:59:35.549 --> 00:59:35.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
and the types of lobster traps that can
 
00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
be used and what must be on them for
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
safety equipment to let the lobsters be
 
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
able to escape if the Trap is
 
00:59:48.829 --> 00:59:48.839 align:start position:0%
abandoned that kind of thing is is set
 
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
up in our law to mirror what the
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
Government Federal Government said they
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
needed to have
 
00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
done there's there's no ability to have
 
00:59:59.069 --> 00:59:59.079 align:start position:0%
completely open access you can't just go
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
out and start catching fish or hunting
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
animals without a license with the
 
01:00:08.589 --> 01:00:08.599 align:start position:0%
exception of if you own a bunch of land
 
01:00:10.589 --> 01:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
you can hunt on your own
 
01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:13.839 align:start position:0%
property but you still subject to the
 
01:00:17.549 --> 01:00:17.559 align:start position:0%
limits of the law in the state such as I
 
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
can still only take one deer in the
 
01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:23.720 align:start position:0%
season if I take it on my property I
 
01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
just don't have to pay for the deer tag
 
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
and license I can use a tag that's free
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
to take my deer and tag it uh that
 
01:00:34.029 --> 01:00:34.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't extend to things like hunting
 
01:00:37.349 --> 01:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
bear or turkey I would still have to buy
 
01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
those tags I can't hunt them free on my
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
own land because those are a differently
 
01:00:40.799 --> 01:00:41.910 align:start position:0%
own land because those are a differently
managed

01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
managed
 
01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
resource so I would say
 
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
overall that thick book that was going
 
01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
around is full of
 
01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
restrictions that prevent you from being
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
able to just freely go out and fish or
 
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
hunt as
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
needed and so hunting and fishing
 
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't tie into our state's food
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
security food Security in the state is
 
01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
um governed more by the state when
 
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
somebody has an inse a food insecurity
 
01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:16.599 align:start position:0%
in their family they apply for state aid
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
and they get uh vouchers to be used to
 
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
purchase groceries and food with the
 
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
state tax dollars helping to subsidize
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
them to keep to to supplement their food
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
security we don't uh just say here's a
 
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
hunting license go out and get something
 
01:01:35.069 --> 01:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
we we give them a voucher to a grocery
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
store and they go through it that
 
01:01:39.789 --> 01:01:39.799 align:start position:0%
way uh I think that was pretty much
 
01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
everything that you were asking about
 
01:01:45.549 --> 01:01:45.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
well all of our fishermen especially in
 
01:01:51.789 --> 01:01:51.799 align:start position:0%
the uh fresh water I'll have to have a
 
01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
license and it's amazing that they take
 
01:01:56.349 --> 01:01:56.359 align:start position:0%
great PR
 
01:01:59.150 --> 01:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
and following the laws because we know
 
01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
that the license money goes to help
 
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
support the sport and the Fisheries when
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
someone is out there breaking the law
 
01:02:10.829 --> 01:02:10.839 align:start position:0%
over limits not having a license there's
 
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of Social and and uh pressure to
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
get these guys caught because the the
 
01:02:19.150 --> 01:02:19.160 align:start position:0%
the hunters and fishermen really take a
 
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
lot of pride in being the
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
so uh to to clarify our fishing game Law
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers they do have arrest
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
capability and if necessary they can
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
arrest on site however and and they are
 
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
allowed to walk up to you and say show
 
01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.039 align:start position:0%
me your license and let me look in your
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
fish bag and see what you have and tell
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
me how you caught that they have the
 
01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
they have the right by law to do that
 
01:02:56.029 --> 01:02:56.039 align:start position:0%
and they can pull your license and they
 
01:02:59.390 --> 01:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
can at at the minimum send you home and
 
01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
say you can't fish anymore but so they
 
01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
do have the authority to to enforce laws
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
in the field but as as representative
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
wette said I think that the community of
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
of uh fishing game users takes a lot of
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
pride in making sure that we protect the
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
resource that everyone is involved in
 
01:03:24.269 --> 01:03:24.279 align:start position:0%
that yeah I'm not sure I really caught
 
01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
the question but I will add BAS on the
 
01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
ansers that
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
um as a landowner I'm allowed to post my
 
01:03:35.309 --> 01:03:35.319 align:start position:0%
property and uh make it so that you
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
can't hunt on it or fish on it um most
 
01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire land owners do not do that
 
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
they leave their property open for the
 
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
public to come and Hunt um and uh
 
01:03:50.349 --> 01:03:50.359 align:start position:0%
there's a program called current use
 
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
where I they the state gives me a little
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
bit of break on my taxes on the property
 
01:03:58.589 --> 01:03:58.599 align:start position:0%
for allowing recreational use of my
 
01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
property to the to the residents of the
 
01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
state and that that brings me into a
 
01:04:05.269 --> 01:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
good point that I should explain about
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
how our state property works because
 
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
this this is important we're very
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
different from some of the other states
 
01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:13.640 align:start position:0%
in the Midwest of the United States and
 
01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
such here in New England in the
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
northeast of the United States we have
 
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
since colonial times always been working
 
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:26.200 align:start position:0%
under the the guidance of communal prop
 
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
property so although I own
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
property everybody who takes and does
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
Recreation of hiking walking fishing or
 
01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
hunting can go on any other property
 
01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
without permission as long as it's not
 
01:04:44.349 --> 01:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
posted by the landowner that says they
 
01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
don't want someone on it all of the land
 
01:04:50.349 --> 01:04:50.359 align:start position:0%
is open to use in New Hampshire for all
 
01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
people unless it's specifically posted
 
01:04:56.589 --> 01:04:56.599 align:start position:0%
by the landowner that you can't go on it
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
so uh and as as uh representative Tudor
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
said in order to encourage more of that
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
use um if you've got a large property of
 
01:05:09.069 --> 01:05:09.079 align:start position:0%
land a large amount of property or land
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
um you can get a break on your taxes an
 
01:05:15.309 --> 01:05:15.319 align:start position:0%
extra 15% discount on your taxes uh if
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
you leave it open to all Recreations and
 
01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
don't post it um that is something
 
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
that's been highly guarded and respected
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
here because it means that you don't
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
have to actually sign a lease with
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
someone to be able to go and hunt or
 
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
sign or or fish on their property it's
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
open to everybody to use and as such
 
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
every person here in the state feels
 
01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
like we have a shared interest in all
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
the resources so we're all conserving
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
them because they apply to all of
 
01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.549 align:start position:0%
them because they apply to all of
us

01:05:47.549 --> 01:05:47.559 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:50.200 align:start position:0%
um and uh anybody else have anything to
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
add on to that part of it no all right
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
so that that's how we we run our shared
 
01:05:59.630 --> 01:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
property uh values in the midwest if I
 
01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:01.720 align:start position:0%
was going to go hunting somewhere their
 
01:06:04.109 --> 01:06:04.119 align:start position:0%
default is you can't hunt on anyone
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
else's property unless you have written
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
permission whether it's posted or not so
 
01:06:11.069 --> 01:06:11.079 align:start position:0%
if I go out there for a hunting trip
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
I've got to actually pay someone money
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
and sign a lease with them for
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
permission to use their land to hunt or
 
01:06:20.269 --> 01:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
fish on um and in in our area up here in
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
the Northeast we follow a different
 
01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:25.400 align:start position:0%
model and it's uh the Northeast model of
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
of Land Management that um allows for
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
shared use of the land unless a
 
01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
particular land owner says keep
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
out go ahead just an example of how
 
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
expansive this open permission is in the
 
01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire there's over
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
5,000 miles of snowmobile trails with
 
01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
over 80% of it on private land so it's
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
open to everyone year you know through
 
01:06:56.109 --> 01:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
and quickly it might be worth
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
adding in this new technology that we
 
01:07:02.799 --> 01:07:03.829 align:start position:0%
adding in this new technology that we
are

01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
in those conversations have come a
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
little more complicated because people
 
01:07:12.269 --> 01:07:12.279 align:start position:0%
have been putting their personal trail
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
cameras out on other people's property
 
01:07:17.589 --> 01:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
that they are allowed to hunt on and the
 
01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:19.240 align:start position:0%
property owners have been saying now
 
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
wait a minute now you're taking pictures
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
of me and my wife and my children on my
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
land and I don't want you to do that so
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
we had a bill come through last year to
 
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
that we had to deal with that so that
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
that has put a little bit of A Wrinkle
 
01:07:34.589 --> 01:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
In This Open Access
 
01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
discussion that's a good example of
 
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
where the the progress made in
 
01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
technology caused us to have to
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
implement a new law because nobody wants
 
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
someone coming out and putting an
 
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
automatic camera on their own property
 
01:07:50.029 --> 01:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
that can take pictures without their
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
permission or knowledge that it's
 
01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
there um so we had to implement a
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
specific hunting regulation that says
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
that you can't go and put a camera on
 
01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:01.799 align:start position:0%
someone else's property without their
 
01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
permission um and if you do put it out
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
there that permission only lasts one
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
year you got to get new permission next
 
01:08:10.269 --> 01:08:10.279 align:start position:0%
year you can't just do it all the time
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
and um on your own property though you
 
01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
can put one out and keep it all you want
 
01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:24.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:08:24.070 --> 01:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.040 --> 01:09:09.070 align:start position:0%
 
mer

01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:12.809 align:start position:0%

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:44.300 align:start position:0%
 
question

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:44.310 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:55.530 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:55.530 --> 01:10:09.430 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:13.060 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:13.070 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:50.550 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:55.430 align:start position:0%
 
exus

01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:45.110 align:start position:0%
 
d

01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
okay so the question is basically
 
01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
multiples uh the first one was what
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
checks and balances are in place to
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
ensure that um agent agencies cannot do
 
01:11:58.629 --> 01:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to violate those
 
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
people we
 
01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
represent um and the second part was uh
 
01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
how do we reconcile when we're
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
representing a community what if our
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
community is breaking the law how do we
 
01:12:11.709 --> 01:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
how do we reconcile that and we
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned that uh the federal government
 
01:12:15.709 --> 01:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
sometimes mandates something but we're
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
we have a different opinion have we have
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
have we had to pass legislation that is
 
01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
in conflict with the federal law and how
 
01:12:25.149 --> 01:12:25.159 align:start position:0%
do we manage that um it's very comp
 
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
licated one but it's a good question I
 
01:12:30.090 --> 01:12:30.100 align:start position:0%
will uh start out by saying that
 
01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:31.590 align:start position:0%
will uh start out by saying that
[Music]

01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
um we are representing our communities
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
to the state from the local level to the
 
01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
state but we also elect people that
 
01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
represent the state down in the federal
 
01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
government and so this whole process
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
this chain of of representative
 
01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
government is something that in America
 
01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
everybody adopts and buys into and for
 
01:12:59.709 --> 01:12:59.719 align:start position:0%
the most part uh it's one of those
 
01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
things where if a majority of the people
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
have elected a certain person to
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
represent them then we expect them to do
 
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
the best that they can for everyone in
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
the community and we realize that we
 
01:13:11.709 --> 01:13:11.719 align:start position:0%
might be a minority of that and we might
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
not get what we
 
01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.709 align:start position:0%
not get what we
want

01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
balances we have as Representatives
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
direct contact with the Department heads
 
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
agencies if we hear that some of our
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
constituents are suffering an injustice
 
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
from an
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
agency we can escalate to the director
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
of that agency and if we don't get
 
01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
satisfaction there we can always
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
escalate to the governor because he
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
appoints and governs all of those
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
agencies when it comes down to it every
 
01:13:56.229 --> 01:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
agency in the state is reporting to the
 
01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
governor and the executive Council
 
01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:02.270 align:start position:0%
governor and the executive Council
um

01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:05.470 --> 01:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
so we don't typically have an issue
 
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
where an agency is abusing a community
 
01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
or doing what they want in a community
 
01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
but we do have expectations that we've
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
put into law on how agencies should
 
01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
behave and if they violate those
 
01:14:23.629 --> 01:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
expectations we do have methods to
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
escalate to someplace who
 
01:14:27.870 --> 01:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
at at the end the governor could remove
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
the director of that Agency for not
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
keeping his agency in
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
line um and even if it went far enough
 
01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
could press charges and prosecute the
 
01:14:39.070 --> 01:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
director of the agency for
 
01:14:41.709 --> 01:14:41.719 align:start position:0%
violating um his contract under the law
 
01:14:42.629 --> 01:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:14:42.639 --> 01:14:45.430 align:start position:0%
with the
state

01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
um the second half of the question uh
 
01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
with representing our communities and
 
01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
whether we have conflicts with federal
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
government yes um frequently we have
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
have found ourselves at odds with what
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
the federal government but it's one of
 
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
those things that changes depending on
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
who the administration is for the most
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
part I'll say one of the most blatant
 
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
examples really doesn't have anything to
 
01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
do with fish and game but some states
 
01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
within the United States have decided
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
that they don't like the federal
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
prohibition on use of
 
01:15:20.629 --> 01:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
marijuana and they have implemented
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
local state laws and they have
 
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
said we as a state don't care if the
 
01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
federal government said we can't do it
 
01:15:29.629 --> 01:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it anyway because
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
we're not going to enforce the law here
 
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
state now they call that legalization
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
but it's typically it's really not
 
01:15:41.229 --> 01:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
legalization what it is is refusal to
 
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
prosecute and refusal to arrest by the
 
01:15:46.350 --> 01:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
state so the federal government if they
 
01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
want to enforce it is now at the point
 
01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
where they have to send federal agents
 
01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
in and use federal law enforcement
 
01:15:58.270 --> 01:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
officers to enforce something and to be
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
frank there's not enough federal law
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers to enforce laws
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
like that in every state so if a state
 
01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
comes forward like Colorado has done and
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
like Oregon has done and California and
 
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
says we're not going to prosecute people
 
01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:16.280 align:start position:0%
for having marijuana and using it the
 
01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:19.719 align:start position:0%
federal government is at that point
 
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
stuck with only Prosecuting and and
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
working against Crime of that if it's
 
01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
big enough to attract their attention
 
01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
the average person on the street they
 
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
just don't have the manpower to do it um
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
we had a bill a while back that uh was
 
01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:39.400 align:start position:0%
another good
 
01:16:42.189 --> 01:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
example when there was a fear that the
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
federal government might Implement some
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
form of gun control by executive order
 
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
that would take away our gun rights in
 
01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
the state we in New Hampshire passed a
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law that said none of our
 
01:16:56.910 --> 01:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
law enforce ment in the state will
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
enforce any federal ban on
 
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
firearms that goes against our Second
 
01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:05.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment right in our
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution and so any such attempt to
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
try to restrict Firearms within our
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
state would require the federal
 
01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
government to send in their own Army of
 
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
people because our law enforcement were
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
going to be on our side they would be
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
defending our right to keep those guns
 
01:17:24.629 --> 01:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
and that passed and was signed as well
 
01:17:24.639 --> 01:17:25.790 align:start position:0%
and that passed and was signed as well
um

01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:28.030 --> 01:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
I think I got everything but I'm going
 
01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
to let other people pitch in here uh
 
01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:31.510 align:start position:0%
to let other people pitch in here uh
representative

01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
ulette the gentleman asked if you had a
 
01:17:36.629 --> 01:17:36.639 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement that was really
 
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
running rough shot over the community
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
how would you deal with
 
01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
it if I'm a fisherman and I don't think
 
01:17:46.350 --> 01:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
I'm treated right have a ticket my next
 
01:17:48.910 --> 01:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
step is to go to the local Court the
 
01:17:51.870 --> 01:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
court judge there is nonpartisan and
 
01:17:54.189 --> 01:17:54.199 align:start position:0%
follows the law and if you don't like it
 
01:17:56.590 --> 01:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
you can always appeal but there's a
 
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
check and balance to keep that law
 
01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement guy
 
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
intact one thing that uh represent Spain
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
said that we all have the ability to go
 
01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
to the Commissioners and the directors
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
of these departments and and air our
 
01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
griefs but the bottom line is we control
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
their funding so they listen pretty
 
01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
well that's true we can take away their
 
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
money and then they have no money to get
 
01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
paid to operate if they don't listen to
 
01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
us and just Qui ahe I a higher level the
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
the way the states and the federal
 
01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
government are supposed to work is
 
01:18:31.470 --> 01:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
defined in the United States
 
01:18:33.790 --> 01:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution the Constitution is really
 
01:18:37.229 --> 01:18:37.239 align:start position:0%
the highest document that tells us what
 
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
rights we have as Citizens versus what
 
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
rights the government has and in that
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution is the 10th Amendment which
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
says that all things not referenced in
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
the Constitution are left for the states
 
01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
to decide it is great debate as to how
 
01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
that works but that that's really at the
 
01:18:57.870 --> 01:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
highest level where the state gets its
 
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
itself sure um there there
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
are uh there are certainly times when
 
01:19:16.110 --> 01:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
state agencies are conducting themselves
 
01:19:19.149 --> 01:19:19.159 align:start position:0%
in a way that people don't agree
 
01:19:22.229 --> 01:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
with I think a simple example outside of
 
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
fishing game is there are those that
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
believe maybe our environmental agency
 
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.270 align:start position:0%
believe maybe our environmental agency
is

01:19:28.270 --> 01:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
allowing too simplified of a process to
 
01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
site a new landfill which is a very hot
 
01:19:36.750 --> 01:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
topic about where do you put your
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
waste so there are those that believe
 
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
that they're acting in concert in some
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
ways with the industry to site new
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
landfills which we haven't found any
 
01:19:52.030 --> 01:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
direct evidence for but you bring that
 
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
forward as a check and balance that's
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
not something you would take to court
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily but it is something that you
 
01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
would bring forward to your
 
01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
representative or your Senator and say I
 
01:20:04.910 --> 01:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
have a a problem with this agency I
 
01:20:07.149 --> 01:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
believe that this is happening and then
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
we as Representatives or the Senators
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
will take that forward to the head of
 
01:20:14.189 --> 01:20:14.199 align:start position:0%
the agency and if there's a problem
 
01:20:16.030 --> 01:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
we'll work through the governor's office
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
and the Attorney General's office if
 
01:20:19.790 --> 01:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
necessary so there there are certainly
 
01:20:22.709 --> 01:20:22.719 align:start position:0%
times when the average person believes
 
01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
that a an agency is not serving them in
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
the way they want and everybody has
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
their opinion of course so it does
 
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
happen and I think that we have a really
 
01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
that this is the final one for me now uh
 
01:20:49.629 --> 01:20:49.639 align:start position:0%
with all the powers that the governor
 
01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
has in the case where a governor comes
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
in as a governor of a state then he's
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
not working according to what the
 
01:20:59.709 --> 01:20:59.719 align:start position:0%
constitution of that state says what
 
01:21:02.110 --> 01:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
action do you as legislation has to take
 
01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:07.510 align:start position:0%
action do you as legislation has to take
against

01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
him well um as an elected official the
 
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
governor has won his
 
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
seat however we can if if it was an
 
01:21:20.350 --> 01:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
egregious enough um well we'll start
 
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
with a minor one if he's if he's doing
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
something minor that is disagreed with
 
01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
the first people that would stop him is
 
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
the check and balance of the executive
 
01:21:29.870 --> 01:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
counsel that's the five people that are
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
elected that control uh large budget
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
items that the governor May approve they
 
01:21:39.229 --> 01:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
have to also approve it um appointments
 
01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
of personnel uh to to the different
 
01:21:47.070 --> 01:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
departments um they have to approve that
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
um they serve as the first check and
 
01:21:50.830 --> 01:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
balance on the governor abusing his
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
power and we're one of the only states
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
that has that executive counil IL um
 
01:21:59.390 --> 01:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
it's a hold over from our colonial days
 
01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
when the king of England used to appoint
 
01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:02.750 align:start position:0%
when the king of England used to appoint
our

01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
governor and the colonists here in New
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire didn't like the way the
 
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
governor was
 
01:22:12.669 --> 01:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
working and we were going to
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
rebel and in order to to calm us down
 
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
the king said I will let you have an
 
01:22:20.669 --> 01:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
executive counil of people from your own
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
community that serve as a check and
 
01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
balance against my Governor if you don't
 
01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:22:29.149 --> 01:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
rebellion and we've kept that even in
 
01:22:31.870 --> 01:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
the days of Elections now where we have
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
an elected executive Council that serves
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
as a check and a balance against the
 
01:22:39.629 --> 01:22:39.639 align:start position:0%
direct the governor's direct immediate
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
power the other thing is the governor's
 
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
reelected every two
 
01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:45.669 align:start position:0%
reelected every two
years

01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
so if he screwed up bad enough he would
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
not get reelected in 2 years in some
 
01:22:53.350 --> 01:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
states the governor's elected for six
 
01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
years well that's a long time to be in
 
01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
there if he's abusing his power two
 
01:22:59.430 --> 01:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
years it's very easy to turn it over and
 
01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
get rid of
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
him and then we always have the ability
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
to impeach if both the house and the
 
01:23:11.149 --> 01:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
Senate agree in great enough numbers we
 
01:23:15.629 --> 01:23:15.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%

[Music]

01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:03.719 align:start position:0%
good question so that Carol that was
 
01:25:05.950 --> 01:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
basically um wondering if we ever take a
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
recess where we can go back to our
 
01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
communities to find out how things are
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
being applied and how things are working
 
01:25:12.910 --> 01:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
there so we can get the input from the
 
01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
people and first I'll say um unlike the
 
01:25:19.709 --> 01:25:19.719 align:start position:0%
federal situation where people go down
 
01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
to Washington and they may stay down
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
there and not come back here in New
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sure uh we're a small enough
 
01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
State uh that the furthest someone has
 
01:25:33.229 --> 01:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
to drive to be here is 3 hours and
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
um people live in that
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
Community when we come up here we come
 
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
up usually for our session once a week
 
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
from January to
 
01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
June from June through the end of the
 
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
year we're mostly off and we're back in
 
01:25:53.629 --> 01:25:53.639 align:start position:0%
our communities for that period of time
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
we do most all of our work from January
 
01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:57.830 align:start position:0%
we do most all of our work from January
through

01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
June um in addition every single day
 
01:26:03.629 --> 01:26:03.639 align:start position:0%
that we're not here we're in our home
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
community and we're not here every day
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
five days a week from January to June
 
01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
this committee doesn't meet as
 
01:26:15.310 --> 01:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
frequently so we will be up here a few
 
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays between January and June for
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
our committee hearings and we'll spend
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
all day doing them and then we go home
 
01:26:27.229 --> 01:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
and almost every Thursday we're here to
 
01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
be in the house session in the big Hall
 
01:26:32.149 --> 01:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
with all 400 people voting on the bills
 
01:26:33.550 --> 01:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
that have been coming out of committees
 
01:26:36.669 --> 01:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
or have been coming to us from the
 
01:26:41.310 --> 01:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
Senate aside from those days we're home
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
some committees have more time in up
 
01:26:45.149 --> 01:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
here and
 
01:26:45.159 --> 01:26:46.709 align:start position:0%
here and
conquered

01:26:46.709 --> 01:26:46.719 align:start position:0%
conquered
 
01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
um finances here a lot but they still go
 
01:26:53.590 --> 01:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
home every night to their communities
 
01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
and they still have have from June
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
through the end of the year that they
 
01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
live in that community and they get to
 
01:27:00.990 --> 01:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
hear directly from people all that time
 
01:27:04.510 --> 01:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:07.270 align:start position:0%
 
there

01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:27:09.550 --> 01:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
repet what um represents Spain is
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
correct but remember we have to stay in
 
01:27:14.350 --> 01:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
our communities because for $200 a year
 
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
if you're not retired we all have
 
01:27:18.990 --> 01:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
full-time jobs and families and and
 
01:27:20.669 --> 01:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
churches and things we're involved
 
01:27:24.430 --> 01:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
and then also in the electronic World
 
01:27:28.669 --> 01:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
our constituents are never far from our
 
01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
cell phones on email or texting us they
 
01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
all have our phone numbers to call us um
 
01:27:36.750 --> 01:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
so there's there are many means for our
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
constituents to uh communicate with us
 
01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
and express the displeasure if if they
 
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:53.109 align:start position:0%
and express the displeasure if if they
want

01:27:53.109 --> 01:27:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
so most of
 
01:28:39.550 --> 01:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
us have another elected position or so
 
01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
that we serve but it's not one that gets
 
01:28:46.350 --> 01:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
paid um for example representative Brown
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
here is a selectman in his town do you
 
01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
get any compensation there uh yeah I get
 
01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
more than
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
here um yes I do
 
01:28:58.950 --> 01:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
but but um I have a full-time day job
 
01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
I'm a senior technical writer for an
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
industrial tools company that does
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
non-destructive inspection and uh X-ray
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
and ultrasonic inspections on things
 
01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
like aircraft and windmills and things
 
01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.430 align:start position:0%
like aircraft and windmills and things
like

01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
that that's what I do full-time and
 
01:29:16.189 --> 01:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
that's how I make my money the $100 a
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
year is in our constitution it'll not
 
01:29:21.709 --> 01:29:21.719 align:start position:0%
get changed anytime soon we don't vote
 
01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:24.119 align:start position:0%
ourselves AR raay like other states do
 
01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
because it's in our Constitution that
 
01:29:28.189 --> 01:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
means we need to have a majority of the
 
01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
house 3 fifths to 3 fifths of the house
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
has to vote to pass an amendment to our
 
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
constitution to change what we get paid
 
01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
then a three-fifths of the Senate has to
 
01:29:40.350 --> 01:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
do the same and then it's got to go on
 
01:29:42.109 --> 01:29:42.119 align:start position:0%
the ballot so that three-fifths of the
 
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
people in the state vote for it on their
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
election and then it could happen but
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
it's a very high bar and it's and it was
 
01:29:53.229 --> 01:29:53.239 align:start position:0%
set way way back when $100 a year was
 
01:29:55.109 --> 01:29:55.119 align:start position:0%
actually compens ation for a farmer to
 
01:29:57.189 --> 01:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
come down here and miss some of his
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
crops being being pulled in now it's a
 
01:30:03.229 --> 01:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
it's more of a thing of Pride for us
 
01:30:06.189 --> 01:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
because we we work because we want to do
 
01:30:07.790 --> 01:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
the work not because we're getting paid
 
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
to do it and that's why we consider
 
01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves a volunteer
 
01:30:15.790 --> 01:30:15.800 align:start position:0%
legislature um it's another reason we
 
01:30:18.510 --> 01:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
don't need the term limits right at $100
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
a year how long are you going to put up
 
01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
with it before you're like all right I'm
 
01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
done I had my fill and I'm going to go
 
01:30:26.910 --> 01:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
back to my day job and and whatnot um so
 
01:30:29.229 --> 01:30:29.239 align:start position:0%
it it keeps us from needing term limits
 
01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
nobody's a career
 
01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
politician and um yes you can have you
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
can have other elected positions there
 
01:30:39.149 --> 01:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
are some there are some qualifications
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
for that because you can't have a
 
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
conflicting one there's there's areas of
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
conflicted interest such as I could not
 
01:30:46.990 --> 01:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
be a senator and a representative at the
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
same time I could not run for governor
 
01:30:51.709 --> 01:30:51.719 align:start position:0%
and Senator and Senator or
 
01:30:54.109 --> 01:30:54.119 align:start position:0%
representative at the same time um I
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
could not be the director of one of the
 
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
Departments and a representative at the
 
01:30:58.440 --> 01:30:59.390 align:start position:0%
Departments and a representative at the
same

01:30:59.390 --> 01:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:01.030 align:start position:0%
same
time

01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
um there are some areas where you can't
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
be both but but in most cases
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
everybody's either retired from their
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
work and and they're doing this because
 
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
they're bored at home and they want to
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
come out and do something in conquered
 
01:31:16.229 --> 01:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
that helps out the state or they've got
 
01:31:16.239 --> 01:31:18.070 align:start position:0%
that helps out the state or they've got
another

01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
job and I've got business cards for
 
01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
everybody here by the way from myself
 
01:31:28.109 --> 01:31:28.119 align:start position:0%
that little bit I I would add to that
 
01:31:31.109 --> 01:31:31.119 align:start position:0%
answer that there are there are those
 
01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
that say the New Hampshire legislature
 
01:31:37.149 --> 01:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
should be paid more because it tends to
 
01:31:39.070 --> 01:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
be an old person's
 
01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
legislature because we are mostly many
 
01:31:46.070 --> 01:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
of us are retired or some of U many
 
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
folks like the chairman have the have
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
the option to to cut out a little bit
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
from work and change the work schedule
 
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
but yeah yes there are definitely those
 
01:31:58.590 --> 01:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
that believe if we were paid more that
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
it would be a younger legislature and it
 
01:32:03.709 --> 01:32:03.719 align:start position:0%
would allow more people to take part in
 
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
the process um but I think there is a
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
great deal of pride in the fact that we
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
are volunteers and that we we are doing
 
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
good I know that we're com close to the
 
01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
end but would you have a very quick
 
01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:22.350 align:start position:0%
end but would you have a very quick
question

01:32:22.350 --> 01:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
from uh thank you
 
01:32:26.109 --> 01:32:26.119 align:start position:0%
uh Mr
 
01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
chairman I need I I need to know if you
 
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
have a national Marine fishery service
 
01:32:36.750 --> 01:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
inside New Hampshire
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
State national Marine service within the
 
01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:41.189 align:start position:0%
State national Marine service within the
state

01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
yeah we have connections to the National
 
01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
marine fisheries but but that's through
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
our fishing game department we don't
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
actually have an office of national
 
01:32:54.830 --> 01:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
marine fisheries here okay we have uh
 
01:32:57.629 --> 01:32:57.639 align:start position:0%
also some members of the fishing
 
01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
community on our Sea Coast that sit on
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
the North Atlantic marine
 
01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:04.189 align:start position:0%
the North Atlantic marine
fisheries

01:33:04.189 --> 01:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
fisheries
 
01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
Council um as advisers for what's good
 
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire and they are fishermen
 
01:33:11.229 --> 01:33:11.239 align:start position:0%
who have either retired or a current
 
01:33:13.550 --> 01:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
fisherman so they have uh the best
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
interest of the industry of the
 
01:33:17.229 --> 01:33:17.239 align:start position:0%
fishermen in mind when they're talking
 
01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
with them uh of course fish and game is
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
going to be representing our biological
 
01:33:25.109 --> 01:33:25.119 align:start position:0%
diversity and um uh sustainability of
 
01:33:29.109 --> 01:33:29.119 align:start position:0%
our our species along the Sea Coast um
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
and the recreational fishermen more than
 
01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
the commercial fisherman that the
 
01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
fisherman that sits on the council would
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
so I don't know where they're
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
headquartered probably out of Boston
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
right I think so I think that they're
 
01:33:41.390 --> 01:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
office their main office for the North
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
Atlantic marine fisheries Coalition uh
 
01:33:47.870 --> 01:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
or council is out of Boston Mass which
 
01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
is just about an hour south of
 
01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:51.830 align:start position:0%
is just about an hour south of
here

01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
um I have a a slightly unrelated comment
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
our fish and game department has uh has
 
01:34:03.109 --> 01:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
many of the uh similar agencies across
 
01:34:03.119 --> 01:34:04.310 align:start position:0%
many of the uh similar agencies across
the

01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
country created a television show which
 
01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
shows you how the law enforcement
 
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
officers go around the state and do
 
01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:12.189 align:start position:0%
officers go around the state and do
their

01:34:12.189 --> 01:34:12.199 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
business uh it's uh you can see them on
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
YouTube it's called Northwoods law it's
 
01:34:20.109 --> 01:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
really interesting to see how the
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers deal with the
 
01:34:24.990 --> 01:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
public and and the types of things that
 
01:34:26.669 --> 01:34:26.679 align:start position:0%
that they have to manage on a day-to-day
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
basis um I think and and one of thing we
 
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
didn't talk about real quick is that our
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
fishing game Department's also
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for um search and rescue
 
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
when people are lost on the mountain
 
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
tops and that type of
 
01:34:40.830 --> 01:34:40.840 align:start position:0%
thing yeah they they if anybody has any
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
questions on about how the law
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement aspect works that's a great
 
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
show to pick up on YouTube if you go out
 
01:34:47.790 --> 01:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
and look at it uh if you look at
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
Northwoods law you'll see that's us and
 
01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
that's our guys out in the field
 
01:34:56.430 --> 01:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
checking license es doing a rescue uh
 
01:34:57.790 --> 01:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
poachers all of
 
01:35:03.870 --> 01:35:03.880 align:start position:0%
that rouette our fishing gaming
 
01:35:06.510 --> 01:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
department is really unique and a lot of
 
01:35:08.830 --> 01:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
times Innovative in the last few years
 
01:35:11.790 --> 01:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
they've really helped uh fishermen along
 
01:35:14.189 --> 01:35:14.199 align:start position:0%
the coast develop an oyster farm and an
 
01:35:17.310 --> 01:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
oyster business that never existed uh
 
01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
which is very interesting um 50 years
 
01:35:22.830 --> 01:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
ago there were relatively no moose in
 
01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we have a very healthy
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
moose population now that they've even
 
01:35:30.669 --> 01:35:30.679 align:start position:0%
have hunting season uh again when I was
 
01:35:32.229 --> 01:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
a young man there was no turkeys in New
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they made a deal with the
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
state of West Virginia West Virginia had
 
01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
a problem with porcupines overrunning
 
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
their territory New Hampshire has a an
 
01:35:43.390 --> 01:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
animal called a Fisher up here that eats
 
01:35:46.910 --> 01:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
porcupines we switched trade them fishes
 
01:35:49.390 --> 01:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
for turkeys now we've got a very healthy
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
turkey population here very Innovative
 
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:59.629 --> 01:35:59.639 align:start position:0%

law in order to see what can be applied
 
01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
in our respective count based in our
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%

of my members were given some this year
 
01:37:18.830 --> 01:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
that they didn't pick up so we might
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
have some extras uh but I don't think
 
01:37:22.510 --> 01:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
the box is still in the office is you
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:28.830 --> 01:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
there I'll see if the if we can get a
 
01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:29.870 align:start position:0%
there I'll see if the if we can get a
copy

01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
copy
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%

we've got 1 two 3 four five
 
01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
six seven seven visitors yeah but how
 
01:37:49.149 --> 01:37:49.159 align:start position:0%
many individual countries if we had to
 
01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
do just countries six okay so six or
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
seven I'll try to get the seven if we've
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
only got to squeeze out one extra that's
 
01:37:59.149 --> 01:37:59.159 align:start position:0%
fine all right um anybody else have
 
01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:00.520 align:start position:0%

01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you all for coming and and I think
 
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
it's it's fantastic to be able to share
 
01:38:07.870 --> 01:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
like this um I was really happy to hear
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions that I could answer
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
that had to do with uh how things work
 
01:38:15.709 --> 01:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
legislatively um I was a little
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
concerned at first that we might not be
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
able to discuss too much of what might
 
01:38:22.189 --> 01:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
impact your country as far as fishery
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
poaching and things because we don't
 
01:38:25.709 --> 01:38:25.719 align:start position:0%
have that same type of a situation here
 
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
but it seems like we've been able to
 
01:38:29.310 --> 01:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
provide information to a lot of
 
01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:36.830 --> 01:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
