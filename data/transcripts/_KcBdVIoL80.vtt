shines in in the kitchen it warms it up
 
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
out there but it doesn't do a lot for
 
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
this room so
 
00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 align:start position:0%

carolyn
 
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
good to see everyone uh once again today
 
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
um i'm actually going to have the
 
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
committee start
 
00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
uh on page 64.
 
00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 align:start position:0%
um because i think that'll help explain
 
00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:23.830 align:start position:0%
um because i think that'll help explain
um

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
what you then see on page 65.
 
00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 align:start position:0%
um so this conversation
 
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh is a continuation of the lee act
 
00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 align:start position:0%
commission that
 
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
was brought together by the governor
 
00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
and out of that report were 48 unanimous
 
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations that
 
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
some move forward through executive
 
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
order others were
 
00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
advanced to rule and this is one of
 
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
those recommendations that would require
 
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.030 align:start position:0%
those recommendations that would require
legislation

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
so what you see here on page 64
 
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking at line 13
 
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
which establishes a study commission
 
00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
to review the best way for this
 
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
independent statewide entity to
 
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
take shape so you see that there are
 
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
in lines 20 to 23 what the makeup of
 
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
that commission would look like
 
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
and then the remainder of this page
 
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
articulates the duties that this study
 
00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
commission would have
 
00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
to bring forward a recommendation for
 
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
additional legislation next year
 
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
that if this commission does come to a
 
00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
favorable recommendation
 
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
for this office and there's an
 
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
agreed-upon structure
 
00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
you then see on page 65 the
 
00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.350 align:start position:0%
you then see on page 65 the
appropriation

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
to this yet to be created entity
 
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
in the second year of the biennium only
 
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
so what we've done we've already
 
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 align:start position:0%
allocated the funding
 
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
to be available should this study
 
00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
commission come to a favorable
 
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation and recommend
 
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.589 align:start position:0%
recommendation and recommend
implementation

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
next year that funding is already there
 
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
and we were trying to be proactive and
 
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
think ahead to make sure that commission
 
00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
had broad flexibility to to do their
 
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
work and
 
00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
figure out the best path forward
 
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
that's kind of my overview of the
 
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
sections i'm happy to turn it over
 
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
to the department of justice and i see
 
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 align:start position:0%

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
of the details or more of the the
 
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 align:start position:0%

june of 2020
 
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 align:start position:0%

to a really a remarkable
 
00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
consensus on this um and this was
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation number 16
 
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 align:start position:0%

recommendations

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
um it creates a independent oversight
 
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
or the recommendation creates an
 
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
independent um
 
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
body state agency that oversees

complaints of law enforcement misconduct
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
and since the commission
 
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
issued its recommendations back in
 
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.110 align:start position:0%
issued its recommendations back in
august

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
we had a various group of lawyers from
 
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
that represented law enforcement and
 
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
also the from the eclu and the public
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
defender's office
 
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
we had been working on legislation many
 
00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 align:start position:0%
of the recommendations that we worked on
 
00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
are in are currently in
 
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
sv 96 um but this one
 
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh we were not we were very close on
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh draft legislation that had consensus
 
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
but they were still
 
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
by the time the filing deadline came um
 
00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
we still were um
 
00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
at a kind of a uh a point where
 
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
we didn't quite have consensus um so a
 
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
or commission that that's in hb2
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
would really bring our work product that
 
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.029 align:start position:0%
would really bring our work product that
is

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
existing to the finish line it's
 
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
envisioned that
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
that tight deadline that's in hb2 for
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
that between when we when we convene
 
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
in um if all goes well in within
 
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
july or august that we'd be able to get
 
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 align:start position:0%
to the finish line by that november date
 
00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
that's in there
 
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
um i have uh an 11 page draft
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
most of the language has been
 
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
agreed upon the sticking points where we
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
really need legislative input on of
 
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
course uh
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
is on how to treat the public records
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
um you know what records are public what
 
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
records are not public are the hearings
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
public are they not public
 
00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
and so the idea is to pull these
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
stakeholders back together with
 
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
with legislators and try to get this
 
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
thing like i said across the finish line
 
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.350 align:start position:0%
thing like i said across the finish line
so

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
um that's that's kind of an overview i'm
 
00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions where
 
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
representative could you hold off just a
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
second and uh
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner quinn do you have anything
 
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
you want to add to that
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
no other than i agree with everything
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
attorney broadhead said i i was on the
 
00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 align:start position:0%
commission so
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
we met for 26 weeks 26 different
 
00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
occasions and as you um look at the leak
 
00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:00.869 align:start position:0%
occasions and as you um look at the leak
book

00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
book
 
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation number 16 sections a
 
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
through i is pretty much a um
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
the end work product of a um
 
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
very uh diverse group that made this
 
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.950 align:start position:0%
very uh diverse group that made this
recommendation

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
and i think it's very important and i
 
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
agree with matt you know
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
he's done a lot of work here and he's
 
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
trying to just
 
00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
thread the needle and get it done
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative heath oh thank you um
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
this is a subject i really
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
know absolutely nothing about i've read
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
the billiard
 
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations and how i know it's been
 
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.190 align:start position:0%
recommendations and how i know it's been
controversial

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
controversial
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
i just because i read about in the
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
newspapers how is the process
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
when complaints come in how are they
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
there currently is no uh centralized
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
oversight that was part of the basis for
 
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.710 align:start position:0%
oversight that was part of the basis for
the

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation to create an independent
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
office currently
 
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
um you know on one side of the ledger
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
people were complaining that
 
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
when you have a complaint about law
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement misconduct you file it with
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
the agency that oversees the officer
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
and that creates an internal tension
 
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
and it there's many of those records
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
discipline records
 
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
are not public records so the public
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
really just goes into a vacuum
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
um that's you know one side of the aisle
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
on the other side law enforcement
 
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
agencies they have a they have a really
 
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.269 align:start position:0%
agencies they have a they have a really
unique

00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
unique
 
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
role in society and that their their
 
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.110 align:start position:0%
role in society and that their their
authority

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
is unlike any other
 
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
area of employment and
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
so to create a standardized process by
 
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.990 align:start position:0%
so to create a standardized process by
which

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
these are overseeing is really palatable
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
and from
 
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
law enforcement they really want that
 
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
standard standardization so
 
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
um uh you know that there was room there
 
00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.269 align:start position:0%
um uh you know that there was room there
for

00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
um law enforcement and uh you know
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
various stakeholders to get to an
 
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.350 align:start position:0%
various stakeholders to get to an
agreement

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
you'll see that there are various states
 
00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:08.959 align:start position:0%
that after the incident with george
 
00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:10.310 align:start position:0%
that after the incident with george
floyd

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
floyd
 
00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:13.839 align:start position:0%
many states adopted or moved
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
to adopt similar oversight agencies
 
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
massachusetts i think being the latest
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh that just went into effect
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so um if i may madam cheer
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead so this is uh the lorry
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
list i'm presuming
 
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about or is that
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
another debate about what to do with the
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
lorry list
 
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
those are it's connected um but this is
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
not the lorry list what this is designed
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
is to replace the lorry list um there is
 
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.230 align:start position:0%
is to replace the lorry list um there is
uh

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
another bill that we've worked on and do
 
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
have consensus on
 
00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
um that addresses the current lorry list
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
or the
 
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
the the ees the exculpatory evidence
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
schedule um as it's known now
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
so we will um be
 
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh planning to offer a bill
 
00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:07.839 align:start position:0%
um this session on the ees
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
for going forward this is designed to
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
replace the ees
 
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative murray you have
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um what is the
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
money going to be used for
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
is this to staff the entity um what
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
expenses are you expecting here for half
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
a million
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative murray and
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
this is page 132
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
of the budget book um
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
we put together a very
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
high level sketch of what an agency
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
would require for staffing we worked
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
with the department of administrative
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
services to
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
identify some of those job titles the
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate compensation for those
 
00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately all of that is contingent on
 
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
the study commission's recommendation
 
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
and what that ultimately looks like but
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
we did want to make sure we had adequate
 
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.069 align:start position:0%
we did want to make sure we had adequate
funding

00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
for what one hypothetical agency might
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
look like and we feel that this is in
 
00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
the relative
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
size and scope of what this entity would
 
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.670 align:start position:0%
size and scope of what this entity would
need

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
but again all of it contingent on what
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
the study commission would report back
 
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.750 align:start position:0%
the study commission would report back
on

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
so if i might follow up on that
 
00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:28.470 align:start position:0%
so if i might follow up on that
um

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
this money would not be required
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
until next year is that correct
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
that's correct and you'll notice there's
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
no appropriation in fy22
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative so
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
oops let me let me drop back a bit
 
00:13:04.829 --> 00:13:04.839 align:start position:0%
so the the 517
 
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
000 is for starting in 23.
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative petrie
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you madam chair how extensive
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
is the lorry list in new hampshire
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
um there i i don't know how to answer
 
00:13:34.399 --> 00:13:34.790 align:start position:0%
um there i i don't know how to answer
that

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
um there are um i think it's been
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
publicly disclosed there
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
there are 220 uh five officers on the
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
list currently
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
um and give or take a few um
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
it's currently sub the subject of of
 
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
several lawsuits in the sense that
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
some officers challenge their placement
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
and also there is a
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
seeks to make the the list public
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
um and that went up to the supreme court
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
and now it's still pending back down on
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
remand and superior court
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
um so the the
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
it that those are the facts related to
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
it i i don't know
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
i can't comment or characterize on how
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
extensive it is or
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
to the um you know comparable to other
 
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.350 align:start position:0%
to the um you know comparable to other
states

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh with a similar population whether or
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
not that's
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
more or less than other states i don't
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um i uh sprott had i i guess
 
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:39.350 align:start position:0%
thank you um i uh sprott had i i guess
or

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
or uh mr malaya i i guess uh my question
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
is is
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
uh for either of you and the thing i
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
mean i
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
i think that the idea of establishing
 
00:14:48.959 --> 00:14:49.990 align:start position:0%
i think that the idea of establishing
something

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
as i understand it at the end the what
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
is envisioned is something similar to
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
the judicial conduct committee
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
applying to police officers um
 
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that that can and
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
i think generally that's a that's a very
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
good idea
 
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
um the caveat i have is i wonder
 
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
um if if how this is intended to apply
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
very sort of minor um
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
infractions by a police officer that
 
00:15:24.839 --> 00:15:25.990 align:start position:0%
infractions by a police officer that
nonetheless

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
nonetheless
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh i suppose theoretically could be a
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
could be the subject of a loyalist and
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
let me just give an example a
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
hypothetical example suppose that
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
a a police officer is accused of
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
you know taking too long a lunch break
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
so it's you know the the the chief of
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
police or the captain or whatever says
 
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
wait a minute you uh you're only
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to have 20 minutes or a half an
 
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
hour for lunch you uh
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
you you know you you were out you were
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
off we couldn't get you on the radio for
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
for 45 minutes so um what's going on
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
and the officer offers some kind of an
 
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.350 align:start position:0%
and the officer offers some kind of an
explanation

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
which now the who you know the
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
supervisor has to decide do i believe
 
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
that or not and suppose the supervisor
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
says i don't believe it
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
so now you know
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
at least at least arguably the the
 
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:23.759 align:start position:0%
police officer has been
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
has been found to have lied
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
so you know does that go to the
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
does that get on the uh the lorry list
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
and does that go to the uh
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
to this commission for being to be
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
resolved because i i
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
if that's true i suspect that there are
 
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things you know maybe not
 
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
not the example i particularly made up
 
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
but those kind of really minor
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
sort of personnel things that happen a
 
00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.430 align:start position:0%
sort of personnel things that happen a
lot

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
lot
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
not only in law enforcement but in every
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
other industry
 
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm happy to take that matt i see
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
you're you're unmuted
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
do you want to go first the only thing
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
that i would say is
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
those types of decisions would be within
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
the realm of what the study commission
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh would look to uh sort out and
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
i guess matt at that point i turned it
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
over to you to speak to the details of
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
the current structure versus what
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
might have already been agreed to
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
previously yeah this um
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
so there are two things that i'll
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
address that and
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
it's a very good point uh representative
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
so the first thing is that that's what
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
this agency is trying to address
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
is that what might be misconduct in one
 
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
police jurisdiction
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
is not misconduct in another police
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and
 
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
so those minor you know um
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
you know some would call them white lies
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
right um that could land you on the list
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
in one police department but maybe not
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
in another department
 
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
um and so what this would create would
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
be this agency would create
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
a uniform standard to treat things like
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
that and i will say
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
that the definition that we have
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
currently agreed on
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
for this type of claim is that conduct
 
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
that would negatively reflect on the
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
officer's trustworthiness or
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
credibility which is the constitutional
 
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:20.950 align:start position:0%
credibility which is the constitutional
standard

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
and then it lists specific instances
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
including a lie
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
during a civil administrative or
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
criminal proceeding in a police report
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
or in an internal investigation
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
so there are kind of discrete
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
um i think uh tangible standards that
 
00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.029 align:start position:0%
um i think uh tangible standards that
this

00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
study commission would be analyzing and
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
and i think they would run through those
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
scenarios of what
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
should be um you know misconduct under
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
under the statute that we're creating um
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
representative quinn you have a comment
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
yes i just wanted to add to what matt
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
said to
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
to representative lin if um
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
section d in that um
 
00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:09.919 align:start position:0%
recommendation in lee act we we asked to
 
00:19:09.919 --> 00:19:10.789 align:start position:0%
recommendation in lee act we we asked to
define

00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
define
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
statewide universal definition regarding
 
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
what constitutes misconduct and to your
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
point sir
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
you know a police department has an
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
internal affairs department
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
um uh you know officer says
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh i backed into a delineate a post i'm
 
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:26.789 align:start position:0%
uh i backed into a delineate a post i'm
sorry

00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
um it's uh investigated it's it's solved
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
the officer gets uh
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
you know some you know um minor
 
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
counseling that doesn't go to this
 
00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.029 align:start position:0%
counseling that doesn't go to this
committee

00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
once we define integrity because to your
 
00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
point sir there are a lot of mistakes
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
that are made there are a lot of things
 
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:43.990 align:start position:0%
that are made there are a lot of things
that

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
get resolved but it's the most serious
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
or egregious conduct
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
or as matt said that goes to the
 
00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.549 align:start position:0%
or as matt said that goes to the
integrity

00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
integrity
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
of what would be you know exculpatory in
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
trial so there are a lot of things that
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
take place that would never get
 
00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
forwarded but that's why we had a lot of
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
conversation on this in lee act and we
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
said we have to define
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
to matt's point what is misconduct so
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
once we get that definition then
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
those types of cases to your point
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
something minor
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
if the person didn't um tell the truth
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
could be um an integrity issue and could
 
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.390 align:start position:0%
could be um an integrity issue and could
be

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
forwarded up so so the definition is
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
really really important but to your
 
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.110 align:start position:0%
really really important but to your
point

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
there's so much that takes place that
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
are mistakes you know you know people
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
make mistakes they they will get
 
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
counseled they will you know it will go
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
in their file
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
but it might not rise to that level that
 
00:20:31.919 --> 00:20:32.630 align:start position:0%
but it might not rise to that level that
matt's

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
matt's
 
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
gonna hopefully get defined
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
i think you're muted uh representative
 
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:11.669 align:start position:0%
i think you're muted uh representative
humburger

00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
aaron we can't hear you okay how's that
 
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.510 align:start position:0%
aaron we can't hear you okay how's that
yeah

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
there we go i obviously
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
hit the wrong thing as i was doing this
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
so i i apologize for my
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh lack of zoom experience
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
so uh representative murray you have a
 
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.510 align:start position:0%
so uh representative murray you have a
ques

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
ques
 
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
you have a question yeah thank you madam
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
chair is there a subjective element to
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
this because i think you know you're
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
looking at infractions
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
um something that say an officer says to
 
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
me might just roll off my back
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
um said to someone else might put them
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
over the edge
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
so is there a subjective element and how
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
do you deal with that or
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
you mean subjective in terms of the
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
definition of misconduct
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
yeah um you know suppose you you know as
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
i said you could say something to me and
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
it'll just roll off my back i should go
 
00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
ha ha
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
you could say the same thing to someone
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
else and they want to sue you for
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
defamation or something yep yeah no it's
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
a good point and actually it's a key
 
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
um thing that we hear from our
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
law enforcement constituents on
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
our legislative working group and we
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
have worked really hard to um
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
you can't eliminate all subjectivity but
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
to really
 
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh focus the terms so that it
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
it reduces significantly the
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
subjectivity and
 
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
that was one um i think back in december
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
we had some meetings
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh maybe even in january on it but we
 
00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:50.310 align:start position:0%
uh maybe even in january on it but we
worked

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
worked
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
really hard with the folks from the aclu
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
and uh with the chief habeki from hollis
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
dan conley who's an attorney prosecutor
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
and also a
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
member of law enforcement from goffstown
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
um as well as
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
representatives the lawyers for for uh
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
two of the biggest police unions in the
 
00:23:10.159 --> 00:23:10.789 align:start position:0%
two of the biggest police unions in the
state

00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
um and we work really hard to remove as
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
much subjectivity as possible so that
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
officers when they're on the ground they
 
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
know what
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
is or is not misconduct
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
you know representative murray if i
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
could just add to what matt said
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
and the reason i think this is so
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
important and uh representative lin can
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
can understand this based on his prior
 
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:34.870 align:start position:0%
can understand this based on his prior
um

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
career is that if if
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
if a head of an agency deems that he or
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
she believes that the officer
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
was not truthful that could essentially
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
end a career could end employment
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
so to that you know we thought that this
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
offered what was neutral independent
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
and an opportunity for the officer to
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know go in and say no this is you
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
know because at some point it's
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
if you might not believe that someone's
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
being truthful but
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
is it more probable than not i mean do
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
you have you know
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
is the proof knowing how high the stakes
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
are and then this offers an appeal
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
to the supreme court so knowing the
 
00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:21.919 align:start position:0%
stakes are so high you know and i'll and
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
i'll let
 
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
matt um weigh in if he wants we just
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we get it right
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
and because a lot of times you know
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
there might not be that
 
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
concrete you know evidence or video
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
or so but it again the integrity is
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
everything and we thought that this
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
you know offer more due process for
 
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
the men and women in law enforcement
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
yes he did yeah it made sense to me so
 
00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:51.430 align:start position:0%
yes he did yeah it made sense to me so
um

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
if i can understand it everything's
 
00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
going well
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's my lawyer that's my lawyer so i
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
always go to matt
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah representative heath you have
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chair um so then
 
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
what this means is we're going from no
 
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.950 align:start position:0%
what this means is we're going from no
system

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
no systematized process
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
to deal with these complaints
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
to a process that is organized
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
and has accountability and the
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
funds that are attached to what attached
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
to it will help
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
in the process of developing that
 
00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.350 align:start position:0%
in the process of developing that
infrastructure

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
for which the commission would work um
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
i um i guess that's my question am i
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
getting this right
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
and if so i think this is a just a
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
very positive move for our state to make
 
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
because it seemed
 
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
so subjective previously um
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
but there just didn't seem to be a
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
process based on what i just heard
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
so um but will the funding
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
be used to bring consultants to help
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
design this
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
so the only thing that i would clarify
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
representative heath would be the
 
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.149 align:start position:0%
representative heath would be the
timeline

00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
timeline
 
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
so we stand here march 15th by march
 
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
this budget hopefully will become
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
effective july 1st
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
i think that's everyone's hope um from
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
there this
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
ended this commission is established
 
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
they have until this november
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
to complete their work bring legislation
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
for 2022's
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
legislative session to to formally
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
outline what this entity would do and
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
then the funding piece only begins
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2023 once this entity
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
assuming it does move forward is stood
 
00:26:46.159 --> 00:26:46.630 align:start position:0%
assuming it does move forward is stood
up

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
and the dollars would fund the staff and
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
their operational requirements so
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
no money tied to the study commission
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
for consultants or anything of that
 
00:26:55.039 --> 00:26:56.230 align:start position:0%
for consultants or anything of that
nature

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
nature
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
at least specifically at hb2 i don't
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
know if there are provisions
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
in other bills that might do something
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
like that but these dollars would be
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
once this is stood up and
 
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.870 align:start position:0%
once this is stood up and
operationalized

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
mr skipper did you have something you
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
yes please madam chair certainly go
 
00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.149 align:start position:0%
yes please madam chair certainly go
ahead

00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh committee
 
00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.350 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh committee
members

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is john skipa
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
i'm the director of police standards and
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
training here in new hampshire
 
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
and um i just wanted to speak very
 
00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
quickly to uh
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
madame heath's question
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit earlier i do think it's
 
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
important to
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
to let everybody know that you know
 
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
presently there is a system in place
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
it was determined that the system that's
 
00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
in place to address these
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
kinds of events is not standardized
 
00:27:59.909 --> 00:27:59.919 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
but in fact it is something that police
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
standards and training handles right now
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
we are the regulatory body for a
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
certification of police officers
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
and we do operate as an executive
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
stand-alone branch of government
 
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
and we do have statutory authority to
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
address these concerns
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
the problem that was highlighted during
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
the leak
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
commission was that there was no
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
really robust resources for us to do
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
this in the first instance and secondly
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh our rules lacked a lot of things that
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner quinn just spoke about and
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
attorney broadhead just spoke about to
 
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.389 align:start position:0%
attorney broadhead just spoke about to
include

00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
a universal definition of
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
what would constitute misconduct and
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
a statewide universal way to accept
 
00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.430 align:start position:0%
a statewide universal way to accept
complaints

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
and then finally the
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
the notion of building in transparency
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
and and uh the public availability
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh for these types of hearings uh that
 
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
we already hold
 
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
so uh i i didn't want anybody on the on
 
00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:09.990 align:start position:0%
so uh i i didn't want anybody on the on
this

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh committee to think that there is
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
nothing in place right now
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
uh in the first instance and secondly
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh i i look forward to working with uh
 
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
whatever uh subcommittee has put
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
together to
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
to address this i was not at the uh
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
the table during this last round of
 
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.549 align:start position:0%
the table during this last round of
discussions

00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:30.559 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh that attorney broadhead was was uh
 
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.230 align:start position:0%
uh that attorney broadhead was was uh
leading

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
leading
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
and i do think that uh that would be
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
something that would need to happen
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
just so that we're we're making sure
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative lynn you have a question
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you um and it's really
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
it's really more of a sort of a
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
two things that i that i hope this
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
commission will
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
will uh will will think about and or
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
uh that that it doesn't become a problem
 
00:30:11.919 --> 00:30:12.230 align:start position:0%
uh that that it doesn't become a problem
and

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
i guess the first one is the issue and i
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
say this because this has been something
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
that has been
 
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
um sort of a uh uh
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
things that lawyers and judges have
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
grumbled about in their in their own
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
disciplinary system
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
and that is that as as you uh you may
 
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
know matt
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
um under the uh both really into under
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
the judicial conduct system and under
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
the uh bar uh
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
regulatory thing it can it can often be
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
the case
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
that um uh
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
the lawyer at the end or the judge at
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
the end of the whole process
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
is required to pay the costs of the
 
00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.830 align:start position:0%
is required to pay the costs of the
prosecution

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
prosecution
 
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh of the of the lawyer or the judge
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
and that may be entirely appropriate for
 
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.389 align:start position:0%
and that may be entirely appropriate for
lawyers

00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
lawyers
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
and judges i think it would be
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
making the kind of money that lawyers
 
00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
and judges are making and i think it
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
it would be really unfair if law
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
who went through this process at the end
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
of it were required to pay the costs of
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
of that and then the second thing and i
 
00:31:30.399 --> 00:31:31.669 align:start position:0%
of that and then the second thing and i
i

00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
this may be something that's obvious and
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
maybe you've dealt with it already but
 
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
i assume that this
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
that whatever is proposed in terms of
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
how this commission will operate
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
eventually it will not in any way
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
interfere with law
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
the supe with law enforcement
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
supervision being able to take whatever
 
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action
 
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
they want to take in other words the
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
only thing that this commission would
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
deal with is
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
what what goes into this list uh whether
 
00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:02.389 align:start position:0%
what what goes into this list uh whether
the

00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
an officer gets fired or suspended or
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
nothing at all happens will be
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
entirely up to whoever's in charge of
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
the agency i assume and nothing
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
right i could take that um so the on the
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
issue of costs
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
um that we're very mindful of law
 
00:32:23.919 --> 00:32:24.549 align:start position:0%
um that we're very mindful of law
enforcement

00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
because of their unique role and you
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
know i certainly i defend
 
00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:30.799 align:start position:0%
uh state troopers uh when they're
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
accused of
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
misconduct in civil litigation um
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
and so from one incident we're mindful
 
00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:38.789 align:start position:0%
and so from one incident we're mindful
of

00:32:38.789 --> 00:32:38.799 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
a police officer may face a disciplinary
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
hearing they may face
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
a police standards and training hearing
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
they may face
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
a misconduct hearing under this uh
 
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
proposed statute and then a litigation
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
you know some civil litigation so
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
for defending for um things
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
simultaneously in some cases maybe it
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
does raise costs
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
concerns and so we've designed this
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
process to
 
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
be as minimal cost as possible and we
 
00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.389 align:start position:0%
be as minimal cost as possible and we
don't

00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
we never considered having a cost
 
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
payment provision in terms of
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
um uh having to to force them
 
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
as a result of this to have to pay
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
in our proposed bill um and it never was
 
00:33:22.399 --> 00:33:23.509 align:start position:0%
in our proposed bill um and it never was
um

00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
and i just forgot the second thing as i
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
was answering that
 
00:33:29.669 --> 00:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
what was the second question that this
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
that nothing
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
that this commission would deal only
 
00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.830 align:start position:0%
that this commission would deal only
with

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
the issue of of whether something stays
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
on an officer's record or not it would
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
have no
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
it would in no way interfere with uh the
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
supervision of a police officer
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
the chief or whatever deciding that you
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
know the officer whatever the discipline
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
correct yes this is uh the only issue
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
before this
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
commission would be whether or not there
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
was a finding a sustained finding of
 
00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:56.950 align:start position:0%
was a finding a sustained finding of
misconduct

00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
misconduct
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
um there is no disciplinary authority
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
authority over the
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
law enforcement certification that's
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
governed by a separate process
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
this is uh for transparency purposes
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh and uh it has members of the public
 
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:14.310 align:start position:0%
uh and uh it has members of the public
that

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
sit on the commission so non-law
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
enforcement members
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
are take part in in the decision um so
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
it is a different standard than
 
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
police standards and training it is it
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
serves a different purpose
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
um like i said to replace the lorry list
 
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
um eventually
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh and to create accountability
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
thank you if i could
 
00:34:44.349 --> 00:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
applicable yeah only going to be
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
working until such time as you decide
 
00:34:50.879 --> 00:34:51.829 align:start position:0%
working until such time as you decide
whatever

00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
you decide for legislation is that
 
00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:59.270 align:start position:0%
you decide for legislation is that
correct

00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
matt did you want to take that one or
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer it but
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
i i'm sorry uh as far as when this
 
00:35:05.599 --> 00:35:06.310 align:start position:0%
i i'm sorry uh as far as when this
commission

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
would complete its work yeah so the
 
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
commission would only exist
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
and the commission has a sole purpose to
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
bring legislation to codify what the
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
duties would be
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
um the commission wouldn't uh exist in
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
perpetuity once
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
their recommendations brought forward
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
assuming the legislature were to enact
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
those recommendations to create this
 
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.430 align:start position:0%
those recommendations to create this
entity

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
entity
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
that entity would begin operation in the
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
second year the biennium
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
and thereon
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
i have to think about that a minute um
 
00:35:53.589 --> 00:35:53.599 align:start position:0%
in this so the the legislation
 
00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
effective on passage
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
because if it comes in
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
november well you know november or
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
december depending on whether it goes to
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
by the time it gets through both of the
 
00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.310 align:start position:0%
by the time it gets through both of the
bodies

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at we're going to be
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
um in june
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
of 22
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
and so it would be
 
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
effective 30 june of 22. is that
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
am i interpreting that correctly
 
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
i would say representative it could not
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
take effect
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
prior to july 1st of 22
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
because the funding is only there in
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
that year
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
um okay this is also the commission
 
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
would have to work out and
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
next year's legislature could either
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate additional money if they
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to start sooner
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
um or they could you know push it past
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
july 1st right and that money would just
 
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.750 align:start position:0%
july 1st right and that money would just
lapse

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
lapse
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
but i think those are all questions that
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
are best answered not
 
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
as part of this conversation with hb2
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
but rather
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
next session after this commission some
 
00:37:19.359 --> 00:37:20.069 align:start position:0%
next session after this commission some
work

00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
okay representative porter you have a
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
question i'm sorry that
 
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh i stepped in there okay madam chair
 
00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
um thank you for letting me ask my
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
again i i'm not familiar at all with the
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
lorry list or how
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers are disciplined
 
00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.069 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers are disciplined
or

00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
whatever but um if there's a an officer
 
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.390 align:start position:0%
whatever but um if there's a an officer
who

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
has serious misconduct and
 
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
ends up on the lorry list do other
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions looking to hire do they
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
know currently that this person
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
is on the lorry list or is that
 
00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.510 align:start position:0%
is on the lorry list or is that
confidential

00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
at this point and if this once this is
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
this new entity is established will then
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
a jurisdiction have access to the list
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
of people who have serious
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
sure under our police standards and
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
training rule there's a background check
 
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's conducted for
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
every new hire and part of that is
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
review of discipline
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
so they'd be aware of it if it was
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
sustained discipline that's the only
 
00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
thing that lands somebody on the lorry
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
list so
 
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't even need to go to the
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
lorry list to get that information
 
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.079 align:start position:0%
although um if if they've had dealings
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
in the past through cases or
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
or whatnot um you know they the
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
certainly they could
 
00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
they could have access to it law
 
00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.630 align:start position:0%
they could have access to it law
enforcement

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
and and prosecutors have access for the
 
00:38:58.829 --> 00:38:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.839 --> 00:39:00.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh does anyone have
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
any opposition to adding
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
police standards and training to this um
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh represent the one thing that i would
 
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
just check on
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
is i know currently um
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that the
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
structure of the commission is
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
is balanced appropriately so right now
 
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
the membership
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
is the attorney general or designate
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
one member of the house one senator and
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
four members of the leak commission that
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
was established by executive order
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
so to the point that we start
 
00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.950 align:start position:0%
so to the point that we start
identifying

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
identifying
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
additional members or members that might
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
be a subset of that react commission
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
would just want to make sure that we
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
maybe either
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
offset that or delineate others um
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
but i i i don't know if matt or either
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
of the agencies that are on have any
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
um i don't have any thoughts other than
 
00:40:22.829 --> 00:40:22.839 align:start position:0%
um uh john weren't you a member of the
 
00:40:22.839 --> 00:40:24.230 align:start position:0%
um uh john weren't you a member of the
commission

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh yes i was so um certainly in that
 
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
capacity he'd be eligible to be
 
00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:29.510 align:start position:0%
capacity he'd be eligible to be
appointed

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh you know to that commission as
 
00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.349 align:start position:0%
uh you know to that commission as
written

00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
okay so the the four additional members
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
the um police standards and training was
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
there and who is
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
going to actually appoint
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh as written the uh
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
those four members i believe would be
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
appointed by
 
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
the commission that i i
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
i would have to check on that and report
 
00:41:11.589 --> 00:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
back to uh madam chairwoman
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh a through c are all clearly
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
delineated um but we would want to
 
00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.030 align:start position:0%
delineated um but we would want to
confirm

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
confirm
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
um the intent of d and and if that needs
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
this is saying it doesn't identify oh it
 
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
identifies the attorney general's office
 
00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:41.190 align:start position:0%
as the chairperson
 
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:42.550 align:start position:0%
as the chairperson
[Music]

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on to
 
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
talk about the other people so
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
it would be basically up to the
 
00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:54.390 align:start position:0%
it would be basically up to the
chairperson

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
chairperson
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
to decide who these four members from
 
00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:58.470 align:start position:0%
to decide who these four members from
the

00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
um leak
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
commission r does that how is that
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
wrong or right or uh
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
if i could just confirm uh and then
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
report back to madame chairman i would
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate just an opportunity to make
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
sure i don't speak out of turn
 
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't specifically say in hb2
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
that might be something we want to
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
further clarify
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
um through an amendment just to ensure
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
that who has the power to appoint those
 
00:42:28.839 --> 00:42:30.069 align:start position:0%
that who has the power to appoint those
individuals

00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:30.079 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
okay nobody's jumping out there saying
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
i'm in charge so that's a good thing
 
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
okay just yeah that would
 
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
i think that is um is necessary
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
since the commission is just
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
being formed and these four other
 
00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.069 align:start position:0%
being formed and these four other
members

00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
wherever they're going to come from i
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna turn to the money
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
okay i went and got my
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:14.630 align:start position:0%
 
anyhow

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:19.109 --> 00:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
it shows uh five people
 
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
for this future whatever it is
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm trying to come to grips
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
with what kinds of people
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
would you be looking for to run
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
so representative what i would say is
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately all of this is contingent on
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
what the study commission has for
 
00:43:50.079 --> 00:43:52.470 align:start position:0%
what the study commission has for
recommendations

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
as for the structure that we
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
built the budget around and again all of
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
this is subject to change
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
this would have an unclassified director
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
and associate director and then there
 
00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
would be three classified positions that
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
you see in hb1
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh an attorney two a paralegal two
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
and a clerk three so it really is just
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
the bare bones of what an
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
entity like this would be required to
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
have to conduct these types of
 
00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:25.270 align:start position:0%
have to conduct these types of
proceedings

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
we chose very detailed analysis the
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
alternative could have been just to
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate say half a million dollars
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
without thinking through what the actual
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
structure would be
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
um so we went through a more thorough
 
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.309 align:start position:0%
um so we went through a more thorough
exercise

00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
exercise
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
but all of this is with the caveat that
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
whatever structure this commission would
 
00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:46.550 align:start position:0%
whatever structure this commission would
recommend

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
and the legislature would then have to
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
pass and adopt
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
that would be what that ultimately would
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
happen but we wanted to make sure we had
 
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
a rough outline of how much money would
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
be required for an entity like this to
 
00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.390 align:start position:0%
be required for an entity like this to
exist

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
if i could just follow up a little bit
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
then i'll be right with you mary
 
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
just the page that's all i need oh sorry
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
page 132.
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
um do we have
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
other things like this in state
 
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.270 align:start position:0%
other things like this in state
government

00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
that have a permanent uh
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
people assigned to them assigned to it
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh so madam chairman on that point i
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
would say that there are
 
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
several agencies that would have
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
some relation to what this new entity
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
tasked with i think you have most of
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
them here on the call
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
uh this afternoon as well um but
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
the recommendation from lee act was an
 
00:45:51.599 --> 00:45:52.630 align:start position:0%
the recommendation from lee act was an
independent

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
independent
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh statewide entity which is why we're
 
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
moving in this direction
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
um and i guess that's all that i would
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
have to say on that
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
topic but i think this might be another
 
00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:05.839 align:start position:0%
area for the study commission to review
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
um exactly what existing functions uh
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
potentially overlap with this
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
but again ultimately we want to put that
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
for the study commission to report back
 
00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:15.750 align:start position:0%
for the study commission to report back
on

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh and from there i'd turn it over to
 
00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i think the closest model that we
 
00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
have uh that's currently in state
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
government to the current
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
version of of of what we um
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
have put together would be the human
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
rights commission
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
which has a pretty small uh permanent
 
00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
staff but
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
there's there's commission members that
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
that oversee it and that's kind of the
 
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:43.829 align:start position:0%
that oversee it and that's kind of the
setup

00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
setup
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
that we are going with in the new
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
senator p thank you um
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair i don't know who would
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
answer this probably the um
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
attorney general matthew um what is the
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
final authority
 
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
of this commission or is that to be
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
the authority of the commission or of
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
the underlying agency that the
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
well as they make their determinations
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
about the process
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
after the process is determined will
 
00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:31.349 align:start position:0%
after the process is determined will
they

00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.839 --> 00:47:38.710 align:start position:0%
 
implementation

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
so as it's currently written and this is
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
section 146
 
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
of hb2 at the bottom of page 64.
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
the study commission is repealed on
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
november 2nd of 2021
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
so as currently written contemplated
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
they would not
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
continue to exist because again their
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
duty is to bring forward legislation
 
00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
if there's another model you know i
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
think we're open to it but we tried to
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
hue very closely to what the lea
 
00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.069 align:start position:0%
hue very closely to what the lea
commission

00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh early yeah what liax put forward as
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
their recommendation
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
um and given that we weren't able to
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
quite solidify all those details in time
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
for the filing deadline
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
um we've continued on with the study
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
commission but again
 
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
in a very short window just to finalize
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
those details
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative heath
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
i would say that
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
this commission might in fact recommend
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
an oversight commission but that's up to
 
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever the commission decides
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a open-ended
 
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
you know because there there are people
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
that oversee the
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
if you're using the human rights
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
commission there are people that do
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
oversee that as well
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
so we'll i guess we'll uh we'll wait and
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
see what happens
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just a little
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
thought here what if this
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
group comes up with a you know
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
recommending future
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
legislation and either the legislation
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
does not get filed or does not get
 
00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:20.790 align:start position:0%
does not get filed or does not get
passed

00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
passed
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
where are we then just a little thought
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
well we're right where we are now
 
00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:27.910 align:start position:0%
well we're right where we are now
exactly

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
with mr uh mr scipio taking care of all
 
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
so uh i think that uh
 
00:49:37.589 --> 00:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
there are folks on here or you know
 
00:49:37.599 --> 00:49:38.230 align:start position:0%
there are folks on here or you know
maybe

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
let me just let me just throw this out
 
00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.270 align:start position:0%
let me just let me just throw this out
too

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
it could be that instead of creating a
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
whole new commission
 
00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:48.559 align:start position:0%
they just give a different sort of
 
00:49:48.559 --> 00:49:49.750 align:start position:0%
they just give a different sort of
authority

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
to what the folks and police standards
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
and training do
 
00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
i mean they don't have to have a new
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
commission you know it could
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
it could be that that's where this whole
 
00:49:59.839 --> 00:50:00.150 align:start position:0%
it could be that that's where this whole
thing

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
lands but that's a i guess what i'm
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
saying is that that's a
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
discussion and decision that we don't
 
00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:08.559 align:start position:0%
need to make
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
um that's what we have the commission
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
uh representative turcotte did you have
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
i thought i'd seen your hand up earlier
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
did i miss it you did but uh
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line somebody
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
answered it so i'm all set
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
the money in 2023
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
not because i don't think that if
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
whatever is devised
 
00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
is we'll need people okay
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
but we have already in the
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
hb1 set
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
the scope of
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
what this new thing can do
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
by assigning by saying in here
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
that you can have five people
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
and so that bothers me
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
to the extent that
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm just not sure that that's
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
the right way
 
00:51:29.589 --> 00:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
to build this um this railroad
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
um myself
 
00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
i would rather see us do something
 
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
like you know put a dollar in it and
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
then whatever the commission comes up
 
00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:42.950 align:start position:0%
then whatever the commission comes up
with

00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
would be something that says
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
you know based on the fact that the uh
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
the law passes then the governor has the
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
authority to
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
withdraw the money at that point in time
 
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
that's just that's my thought process on
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
and representative or madam chairman
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
that certainly
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
could be one approach but what we
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately decided to do
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
was to err on the side of caution to
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
ensure that the budget that we pass
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
is balanced and has funding set
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
aside for this entity now if the
 
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.510 align:start position:0%
aside for this entity now if the
commission

00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
either comes to no recommendation or
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
they recommend legislation that isn't
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately enacted the money would lapse
 
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
back to the general fund
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
at the end of the biennium um but we
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
this didn't get lost in the budget
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
process and then
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
if there's not money sitting around next
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
year to fund it
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to hamstring their
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
efforts because the governor of course
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
is committed to
 
00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
the leak recommendations and is
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
committed to bring them forward
 
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
and again we just wanted to make sure
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
there was a pot of money
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
for them i would defer to the lba if if
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
there's a different model to just do a
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
line item appropriation
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
that a new entity could assign to
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
different class lines or whatnot
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
again we did a very detailed sketch
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
but didn't want to constrain what this
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
i hear you what's the difference between
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
looking at what i have in the budget
 
00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:24.950 align:start position:0%
looking at what i have in the budget
versus

00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
versus
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
versus what the governor had in his
 
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
budget but uh
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
you know i i understand where you're
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
and i also realize that it will um
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
it will take some time to stand up this
 
00:53:38.079 --> 00:53:38.549 align:start position:0%
it will take some time to stand up this
group

00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:38.559 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not like it's going to
 
00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:41.990 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not like it's going to
occur

00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
occur
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
however it is however it is set up
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
so um we'll we'll think about that
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
and we'll we'll work on that as a
 
00:53:57.119 --> 00:53:58.069 align:start position:0%
and we'll we'll work on that as a
committee

00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
but that's just my initial initial
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
thought process
 
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:06.230 align:start position:0%
thought process
um

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:09.040 align:start position:0%

things were going the way they should be
 
00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:24.390 align:start position:0%
things were going the way they should be
going

00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.400 align:start position:0%

00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
ignorance of

how the whole system works i'm a little
 
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
bit embarrassed
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%

unless you're a police officer or you're
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
involved with
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement in the state of new
 
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire nobody even knows we're here
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
so no worries at all
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry we know you were there okay
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
and uh some of us knew that you worked
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
on those issues
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
but um some of us didn't and that's okay
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
you've been doing as as good a job as
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
you could with your hands tied
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
so i we we all
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
no you have not you're relatively new
 
00:55:16.079 --> 00:55:17.270 align:start position:0%
no you have not you're relatively new
but

00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
since you've been on you have been doing
 
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
doing a great job
 
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:24.799 align:start position:0%
so if there are no other
 
00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
comments questions thoughts
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
okay we will uh this is just another
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
one on our list of things to resolve
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
between now and about next tuesday or
 
00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:41.109 align:start position:0%
between now and about next tuesday or
wednesday

00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
wednesday
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
we had something pretty difficult this
 
00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:47.510 align:start position:0%
we had something pretty difficult this
morning

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
i think this one is a little easier
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
if we can figure out the funding
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
side of it i don't think any of us are
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
opposed to the um the formation of the
 
00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:02.150 align:start position:0%
opposed to the um the formation of the
commission

00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
and for them to bring us legislation
 
00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:06.799 align:start position:0%
next year
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
when um at that point um
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
finance will be out of it which is not a
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
bad thing
 
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
oh sorry and i don't think there's
 
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:17.750 align:start position:0%
oh sorry and i don't think there's
anyone

00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
on this uh this group that uh
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
wants to be part of um
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
part of this study commission so um
 
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
if there is i'm sure you can
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
contact mr broadhead and he would be
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
happy to uh
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
find a place for you so if there's
 
00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:38.710 align:start position:0%
find a place for you so if there's
nothing

00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
else uh mickey do you have anything to
 
00:56:40.559 --> 00:56:43.190 align:start position:0%
else uh mickey do you have anything to
add

00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
no i i don't have anything to add um i
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
think at the very least
 
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
you know there was some co-mingling of
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
commission and the body cam
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
dash cam fund in house bill 2. so it's a
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
little confusing as you read through
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
these sections
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
so at the very least we're going to
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
probably do an amendment to clean
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
clean up what's here and then also
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
incorporate whatever the division's
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations are but i just want to
 
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
make it
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
clear that uh there if you're confused
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
when you look through these sections i
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
think there was some
 
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
some issues with the drafting so but
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
we'll work through it
 
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
well mickey i think we had a lot of
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
confusion on a lot of things so
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
but that's but that's why we're here
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's why you're here is to uh
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
is to uh make sure that you uh you keep
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
us straight
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
but i agree totally that uh
 
00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
this commission stuck in there where it
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
was probably
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry represent heath ma'am could
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
we just walk through this week
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
i know we have a lot to cover um
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
and um i know that tomorrow we've got
 
00:57:58.880 --> 00:57:59.430 align:start position:0%
and um i know that tomorrow we've got
two

00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
bills and then we have a hearing all
 
00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:03.510 align:start position:0%
bills and then we have a hearing all
forever

00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
forever
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
then on wednesday we're going to have a
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
work session now will that go
 
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
late into the just i'm trying to figure
 
00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
out my calendar for the week of
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
of how extensive we're going to be tied
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
up in the afternoons and mornings
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
how about it depends um
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
mickey is uh putting together for
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
everybody a list of
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
what we know as open items
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
okay and um i will go through that list
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
tomorrow no probably not tomorrow but
 
00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:49.030 align:start position:0%
tomorrow no probably not tomorrow but
wednesday

00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
wednesday
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
that we will start down that list of
 
00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
things to do
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
and um i will try to
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
initially pick out the things that i
 
00:59:02.799 --> 00:59:03.270 align:start position:0%
initially pick out the things that i
think

00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
we are all in agreement on and then
 
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
um kind of leave the uh
 
00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:13.839 align:start position:0%
stickier things um
 
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
for later on like i know
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
for example we don't all agree on
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
the combining of the university and the
 
00:59:23.829 --> 00:59:23.839 align:start position:0%
community college so
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
that will be you know a longer
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
discussion but
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of what my approach
 
00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:30.789 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of what my approach
is

00:59:30.789 --> 00:59:30.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
and that's why i mentioned that um
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
you know if you have amendments that you
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
want to bring in
 
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
to hb2 that you that you do that
 
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh so that we know you know
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
ahead of time if that's the right term
 
00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:49.670 align:start position:0%
ahead of time if that's the right term
where

00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
these um where these discussions are
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
going to go
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
okay so representative murray you have a
 
00:59:56.799 --> 00:59:57.750 align:start position:0%
okay so representative murray you have a
question

00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you do we know what our
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
allotment is yet and as ways and means
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
the first the answer to your first
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
question is no
 
01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:12.839 align:start position:0%
the answer to your second question is
 
01:00:12.839 --> 01:00:15.990 align:start position:0%
the answer to your second question is
yes

01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
when when we will get that i have no
 
01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:19.349 align:start position:0%
when when we will get that i have no
idea

01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
okay uh but um
 
01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not expecting um
 
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
tens of millions of dollars i'll put it
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
that way that
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh just so it goes in the right
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
direction from ours perspective
 
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
i i got that i got that uh but i'm not
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
on ways and means okay
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
so i have i have done my darndest
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
to uh get them to uh
 
01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
up that because it's you know it's
 
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
really the general fund is
 
01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
is uh is where
 
01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
the majority of the problem is and uh
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
and as we know our share of general
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
funds is
 
01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
pretty small in relationship to division
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
one and division three
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
so um we'll just have to see how that
 
01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.349 align:start position:0%
so um we'll just have to see how that
all

01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
all plays out but i don't expect that
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
we'll be hearing anything from ways and
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
maybe the first part of next week and
 
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure at that time that
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
more than likely any extra general funds
 
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
would go to one and two
 
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
or one in three okay that's just my
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
that's my supposition okay
 
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:48.079 align:start position:0%

wednesday
 
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
and thursday it depends on how how fast
 
01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:20.559 align:start position:0%
we get our work done
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
if we get it done if we're all in
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
agreement on
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%

by friday by thursday
 
01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:31.039 align:start position:0%

01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
my part
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair is there
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh anything else oh but by the way as
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
long as i still have uh
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
safety here um
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
i never got anything back from
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
any of the committees on the radio
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
what was that called radio make sure
 
01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.309 align:start position:0%
what was that called radio make sure
everybody's

01:02:56.309 --> 01:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
everybody's
 
01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
the same part of it
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
language yeah
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
um when you say anything from anybody
 
01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
who is the anyone ma'am
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
i think i who did we send that to mickey
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh does it turn up to science and
 
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
technology perhaps
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
i can't remember i know you sent it to
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
one of the policy committees for review
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
yeah i i i'm not sure which one i sent
 
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
it to but
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
i think i sent it to transportation
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
maybe they were the wrong ones but they
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
didn't get back to me either
 
01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
so i guess that um
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in there that is
 
01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:36.789 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in there that is
controversial

01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
controversial
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
that i could see is there well
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
i i won't say i what i will say is i ask
 
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
director doyle mark
 
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
doyle to kind of speak to the other uh
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
stakeholders the other commissioners
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
and uh you know have some conversations
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
of what
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
it's you know what is the vision here
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
with this you know it's
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
basically for planning making sure we're
 
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
making interoperable
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
decisions on purchases and somewhat like
 
01:04:03.029 --> 01:04:03.039 align:start position:0%
of an overarching
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
governance like doit has for certain
 
01:04:07.029 --> 01:04:07.039 align:start position:0%
expenditures so
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
we have heard nothing back um so
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
that's and i and i asked director doyle
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
personally you know have you
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
spoken outside there to the other
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
agencies and he's very
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
um uh he he over communicates
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh so i haven't heard anything man
 
01:04:29.029 --> 01:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
negative okay
 
01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:32.799 align:start position:0%
well that's easy then we'll uh
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
we'll just leave it unless someone uh
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
unless somebody comes and um
 
01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:39.839 align:start position:0%
gets all upset but i certainly haven't
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
heard anything
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
steve anything to add to that steve
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh no uh just everything that you said
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh is absolutely true we haven't heard
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
any any real negative
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
