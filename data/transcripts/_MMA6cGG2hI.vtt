meant to to address and and essentially
 
00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
overturn the 30-year-old Claremont um
 
00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 align:start position:0%
ruling um be before suing Court ruling
 
00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 align:start position:0%
before I get into the details I want to
 
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
just tell you uh what I handed out to
 
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
you so um um attorney Greg sorg who's a
 
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
former member of your committee um asked
 
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
me to hand out a letter from him so I I
 
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 align:start position:0%
did that he's somebody who did um
 
00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
considerable scholarship on this issue
 
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
who and he created a a compendium of a
 
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
book length comp compendium of Articles
 
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
and and other writings about Claremont
 
00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
which I probably still have on my
 
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
computer somewhere if somebody wanted a
 
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
copy I could give it to you that's that
 
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
I also handed out a copy of the original
 
00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 align:start position:0%
Claremont ruling which you can you know
 
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's very nicely written um even
 
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
though it's wrong in my opinion but it's
 
00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 align:start position:0%
it's well written I mean you don't get
 
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
to be a Supreme Court Justice without
 
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
having skills in arguing so um if you
 
00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
so let me start by making some points
 
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 align:start position:0%
about the Constitution and then we'll
 
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
get into the details of this um so so
 
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
the the the bill itself the amendment
 
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
itself is is Trivial it it replaces the
 
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
word cherish with the word cherish and
 
00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
the point of that is that the ruling in
 
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
front of view um turns in some sense it
 
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
it discusses and puts emphasis on the on
 
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
the word cherish and the meaning that it
 
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
had in
 
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 align:start position:0%
1784 and it sort of ascribes different
 
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
meaning on to that word than it has
 
00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
today in in fact there is no different
 
00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 align:start position:0%
meaning of the word then and now but in
 
00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 align:start position:0%
any case um so the idea
 
00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
is that moving the meaning from from
 
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
1784 to today
 
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
would sort of undermine the um the basis
 
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
of this ruling and I think if if a
 
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
subsequent case came before The Supreme
 
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
Court they would then have to reconsider
 
00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
that case fresh and I think they would
 
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
have second thoughts so um let's talk
 
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
about the Constitution a little bit
 
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.909 align:start position:0%
about the Constitution a little bit
first

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
so the Constitution is not something
 
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
that is subtle is is written so that
 
00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
only experts only the court Etc can can
 
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
um interpret it the
 
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
Constitution is the people's document
 
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
all right until the
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
1960s it was only the people who created
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
it and so on no legislators or judges or
 
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
anything as such other than their role
 
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
as as ordinary citizens were involved in
 
00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
in writing it or creating it and so on
 
00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
right the way the Constitution was
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
created was in the early 1780s there was
 
00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 align:start position:0%
a committee and the committee was
 
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
charged with with drafting a
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
constitution they took the Massachusetts
 
00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
constitution written by John Adams as a
 
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
as a basis and then they made changes
 
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
and they sent those changes out to the
 
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
towns where the the um Constitution was
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
discussed and voted on by all the people
 
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
in their Town meetings and what happened
 
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
was they turned it down okay they read
 
00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
it they didn't like it they turned it
 
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
down and they sent back a bunch of
 
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
proposed amendments to this committee so
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
the committee met again they used they
 
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
looked through all these amendments they
 
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
made changes to the Constitution
 
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
proposal they sent it back to the next
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
town meeting well the next set of town
 
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
meetings they read it they discussed it
 
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
and so on and it
 
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
failed they voted on it it failed and so
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
they sent back even more amendments to
 
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
this committee right so the committee
 
00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 align:start position:0%
get another cycle they they changed the
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
Constitution and so on and the third
 
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
time was the charm right so so on the
 
00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
third vote going back to the toies so my
 
00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
my point is it's not
 
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
something hard to read or or cute or
 
00:07:47.309 --> 00:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
something you know maybe my Amendment my
 
00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:50.919 align:start position:0%
my bill here is too cute but but um but
 
00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
the Constitution itself is something
 
00:07:56.149 --> 00:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
that people ordinary people read it
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
understood it discussed it and voted on
 
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
it right and even today if we make this
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
amendment ordinary people will be voting
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
on it you know so um so that's my point
 
00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:10.919 align:start position:0%
is is is we don't have to sort of you
 
00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
know 200 years later try to look at
 
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
subtleties and this word and that word
 
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
and and that sort of thing right there's
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
plain language in the Constitution all
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
um because of that let's suppose so what
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
what um The Claremont ruling said was
 
00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:37.039 align:start position:0%
that the state has an obligation to fund
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
a quote adequate education for all uh
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
public school children in uh in New
 
00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:45.509 align:start position:0%
public school children in uh in New
Hampshire

00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
and um I would think
 
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
that at the so what we are currently
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
spending on this on the adequate
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
education is roughly a billion dollars a
 
00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
year now some of it is is sort of fake
 
00:09:02.829 --> 00:09:02.839 align:start position:0%
representative Smith has a bill to deal
 
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
with the fake part but but you know you
 
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
could say it's it's it's 700 million
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
real and 300 million fake or something
 
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
like that but um but the point is it's a
 
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
huge expense right this is this is I
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
think the second biggest expense of the
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
state right we don't we now have
 
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid but but at the time in
 
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
1784 this would have been they intended
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
to make this an expense of the state
 
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
this would have been by far the largest
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
sort of expense that they would have had
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
right and so they wouldn't have they
 
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have put it in article 83 of of
 
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:50.200 align:start position:0%
part two it would be right up front in
 
00:09:52.069 --> 00:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
the beginning part of part two where you
 
00:09:55.389 --> 00:09:55.399 align:start position:0%
have all the obligations of of the state
 
00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:56.959 align:start position:0%
right all the all the things the state
 
00:09:59.470 --> 00:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
are supposed to do this would have been
 
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
the major biggest thing that the state
 
00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519 align:start position:0%
would have to do and the legislators
 
00:10:07.069 --> 00:10:07.079 align:start position:0%
would have to do and so on right it's
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
not an afterthought it's not something
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
to be put in to a halfway through a
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
sentence through a runon sentence that
 
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
includes literature and other stuff okay
 
00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:22.519 align:start position:0%
so this is not how it would have been
 
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
written and it's not how people would
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
have understood all right um so let's
 
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
let's read the phrase in question um
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
here and I'll just so so the way the
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
ruling the the Supreme Court ruling is
 
00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:41.079 align:start position:0%
it it focuses on two words the the first
 
00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
being Duty so if you look at the bill
 
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.069 align:start position:0%
being Duty so if you look at the bill
line

00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:45.079 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
six um it shall be the duty of
 
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
legislators and magistrates in all
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
future periods of this government to
 
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
cherish uh the interest of literature
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
The Sciences all seminaries and public
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
schools to encourage public public and
 
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
private institutions rewards immunities
 
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
for the promotion of Agriculture Arts
 
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
Sciences Commerce trades manufacturers
 
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
Natural History etc etc so so the the
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
two words they focus on is Duty and
 
00:11:16.829 --> 00:11:16.839 align:start position:0%
cherish right so duty means you have to
 
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
do something
 
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
right these two words in in reality have
 
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
no different meaning today than they did
 
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
then I can go into more of that if you
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
have questions about it but but the
 
00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:31.639 align:start position:0%
question is is and they and they say the
 
00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:34.839 align:start position:0%
the subtlety is well how do they get
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
around the fact that we're not sending
 
00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:41.959 align:start position:0%
checks to authors and scientists and
 
00:11:44.629 --> 00:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
seminaries right because whatever the
 
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
sentence does to Public Schools it does
 
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
the same thing for literature and
 
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
Science and seminaries right and it's
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
not just any seminaries it's all
 
00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
seminaries right so I don't think we've
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
ever SE sent a check to any semary I'd
 
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
be very surprised if we had so um so so
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
the the ruling kind of tries to finesse
 
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:11.720 align:start position:0%
this that that somehow when we're
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
talking Public Schools cherish means
 
00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:17.079 align:start position:0%
send a check but when we're talking
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
these other things it means something
 
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
else right it means furthering their
 
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
purpose or you know something V so it it
 
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
this is this is the one of the major
 
00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:31.639 align:start position:0%
problems with this is that the plain
 
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
reading of the sentence is all of these
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
things are equivalent right and so and
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
should be treated equivalently by the
 
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
legislature um so let's talk about so
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
that so this doesn't mean what the
 
00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:47.959 align:start position:0%
ruling says so let's talk about what it
 
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
does mean all right so what's the
 
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
purpose of part two article 83 so the
 
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
original part if you read part two
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
article 83 it essentially is two long
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
runon sense sentences right maybe three
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
so so one of them is this first sentence
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
about uh cherish the literature Sciences
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
seminaries public schools for the
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
purpose of Education right in
 
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:13.160 align:start position:0%
agriculture Arts science Commerce all
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
these things the second part of this
 
00:13:17.949 --> 00:13:17.959 align:start position:0%
which was added later so that that was
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
the original part and then the the
 
00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0%
following sentence was added a little
 
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:25.720 align:start position:0%
bit later which is no money should go to
 
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh schools or institutions of a
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
religious sector denomination and then
 
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
even later than that was the was the
 
00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
final part which was about monopolies
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
right free and Fa Fair competition in
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
trades um should be protected Etc so if
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
you look at this as a whole what it's
 
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
telling you is these are the at the
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
front these are the good guys right the
 
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
the people who are helping education
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
right who are furthering
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge those are the people we should
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
be supporting right I mean this is
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
obvious right but it's true and the
 
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
people we should watch out for at at the
 
00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
end here are the you know greedy
 
00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
businessmen who are going to create
 
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
monopolies and steal your money etc etc
 
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
right so that's what this is about and
 
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the particular phrase
 
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
literature Sciences seminaries and
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
public schools the weird part about that
 
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
phrase is the word Public Schools right
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
literature science seminaries those
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
aren't part of government those are
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
external to government right um a and
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
all the rest of this agriculture
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturing you know trades those are
 
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
all external to government right but we
 
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
think of public schools as internal to
 
00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
government so if you look at the last
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
page of my handout I want to suggest
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
that the real word that they should have
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
looked up in
 
00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
1784 is the word public
 
00:15:04.269 --> 00:15:04.279 align:start position:0%
school all right so this is from the
 
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:07.720 align:start position:0%
encyclopedia britanica right and it says
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
that if you went to England even today
 
00:15:12.749 --> 00:15:12.759 align:start position:0%
and ask them what's a public school well
 
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959 align:start position:0%
they'll say this is a place like Eaton
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
and Harrow and Etc right this is a like
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
Philips exiter it's a private school
 
00:15:27.069 --> 00:15:27.079 align:start position:0%
okay that members of the public pay to
 
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
attend that's what a public school is
 
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
even today in England all right what do
 
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
they call what we call a public school
 
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
they call that a local school all right
 
00:15:41.069 --> 00:15:41.079 align:start position:0%
so according to this that term using the
 
00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
word public school to mean that that's
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
an 18th century
 
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:47.759 align:start position:0%
term all right and the people we're
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
talking about who wrote the Constitution
 
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
were very recently
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
British right so I think it's possible
 
00:15:58.749 --> 00:15:58.759 align:start position:0%
at least that um the meaning here was
 
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:01.240 align:start position:0%
they meant things like Philip exiter
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
when they said Public Schools they
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
didn't mean Local Schools right because
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
when you when you make that that mental
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
substitution the whole paragraph makes a
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
lot of sense right the good guys who are
 
00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
furthering you know we' we've finished
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
in earlier parts of the Constitution
 
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
talking about how government works its
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
obligations all that sort of stuff in
 
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
this one we're giving you advice about
 
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
gen externalities to government right
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
how do you deal with um people that you
 
00:16:40.309 --> 00:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
find in in the society right and so um
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
we want you these are the good guys
 
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
right the the people who are spreading
 
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
knowledge including literature
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
scientists seminaries and private
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
schools all right those are all external
 
00:16:58.509 --> 00:16:58.519 align:start position:0%
then then this whole par this whole
 
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
section is about external stuff right it
 
00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.870 align:start position:0%
section is about external stuff right it
isn't

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
about what are we doing with local
 
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
schools what are we doing with you know
 
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
my school your school Etc that in town
 
00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:14.839 align:start position:0%
right that's earlier right that's not
 
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
this so so that's my the basics of my
 
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
argument all right so let's assuming
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
that I've convinced
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
you that this doesn't say what the
 
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
Claremont rule says right but you think
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
um what's the harm right what's what's
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
the harm of the Claremont ruling right
 
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
we we certainly want to
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
support um I'll use the word local
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
school just just to be clear but we
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
certainly want to support our schools
 
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
right and um we've done it for I don't
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
know how many years certainly well
 
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
longer than I've been in the legislature
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
and and we've done it in a smart way way
 
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
we've done it with targeted Aid right
 
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
the way we support uh schools is we have
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
a formula that has characteristics of
 
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
the students in those schools and it has
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
characteristics of the area those
 
00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:17.799 align:start position:0%
students uh come from so that we send a
 
00:18:21.149 --> 00:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
lot more money to areas that are poorer
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
like Berlin for example and a lot less
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
money essentially zero to areas that are
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
wealthy like newcap
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
all right and we send also if you have a
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
lot of say immigrant children a lot of
 
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
English is a second language like
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
Manchester we send them extra money
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
because those are a little harder to
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
teach right so so we do it we do
 
00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
targeted Aid and it's it's reasonable I
 
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
mean it's it makes sense right that's
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
the way to do it all
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
right but what the court has told us in
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
the most recent so so the con the um
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
um Claremont ruling was only the first
 
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
of multiple Court rulings the most
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
recent one is a ruling called conal that
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
came out last year and if you read the
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
conval ruling it it it's the logical
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
conclus I don't blame the judge for poor
 
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
ruling or something like that um I blame
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
these Supreme Court judges for you know
 
00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
wanting a certain outcome and creating
 
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
it but but what the conval ruling
 
00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
does is it is it if you read it it it's
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
a it's like budgeting right there's a
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
there's line after line well a teacher
 
00:19:37.149 --> 00:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
costs this much and a nurse cost that
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
much and a you know building costs this
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
much and a superintendent is this and
 
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
that and there's there's all kinds of
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
calculations and it comes to a final
 
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
conclusion dividing by the number of
 
00:19:50.149 --> 00:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
students and it says that that the
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
minimum that the state should be sending
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
because the state has to pay according
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
to Claremont for for all public for a
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
base basic public
 
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
education it says the minimum that must
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
be sent is I'm not sure I remember the
 
00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
number but it's like
 
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
$7500 and
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
75560 right one cent you know some some
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
number that's the minimum that the
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
constitution requires well the
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution doesn't say you know have
 
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
any calculations or it doesn't say
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
anything like that
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
but and so everybody who likes sending
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
thinks that this is innocuous right
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
likes the state sending a Aid to Public
 
00:20:35.789 --> 00:20:35.799 align:start position:0%
Schools they're thinking well now we're
 
00:20:35.799 --> 00:20:37.710 align:start position:0%
Schools they're thinking well now we're
sending

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
sending
 
00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:41.559 align:start position:0%
$4,100 this ruling says we have to send
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
$7,500 right schools are going to get an
 
00:20:44.799 --> 00:20:46.230 align:start position:0%
$7,500 right schools are going to get an
extra

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
extra
 
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
$3,400 great right and so and if if we
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
multiply $ 3400 times $ 160,000 students
 
00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
that's over $500 million right right so
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
the state as a result of this ruling is
 
00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:05.919 align:start position:0%
going to send five extra $500 million to
 
00:21:05.919 --> 00:21:07.430 align:start position:0%
going to send five extra $500 million to
schools

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
but that in my mind is is a
 
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation of the ruling because
 
00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
and and so and so you might be inclined
 
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
to vote against this because you want
 
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
that to happen right but if you read the
 
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:26.200 align:start position:0%
the conval ruling in particular the key
 
00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:31.559 align:start position:0%
point of it is it's against targeted Aid
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
right the judge as part of his ruling
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
said I only care about per
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
head right I only care about the base
 
00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.230 align:start position:0%
head right I only care about the base
the

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
$4,100 all the rest of the money you're
 
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
sending more to Berlin and less to
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
Newcastle that's irrelevant all right
 
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
it's just the base That Matters to the
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution right it's like silly but
 
00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.630 align:start position:0%
Constitution right it's like silly but
but

00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:01.559 align:start position:0%
and so therefore what conal wants us to
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
do is set up a regime where the money we
 
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
send to
 
00:22:09.549 --> 00:22:09.559 align:start position:0%
towns is only on the base right it's it
 
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
we could do that right we could send
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
$7,500 without spending an extra 500
 
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
million which we don't have right we
 
00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:17.909 align:start position:0%
million which we don't have right we
could

00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
send it might be a little bit more than
 
00:22:22.269 --> 00:22:22.279 align:start position:0%
we spend now but but the point is we
 
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
could send
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
$7,500 to every per head to every town
 
00:22:30.029 --> 00:22:30.039 align:start position:0%
but guess what that's a stupid thing to
 
00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:33.559 align:start position:0%
do right um what we're going to start
 
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
doing is sending money uh to Waterville
 
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
Valley and Newcastle and molten Boro and
 
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
all these places that don't need it
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
right and and we're going to we're going
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
to cut the the the funds that currently
 
00:22:52.269 --> 00:22:52.279 align:start position:0%
go to Claremont and and uh
 
00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
um uh Berlin and other places that
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
really need it the places that would
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
gain under such a regime are places like
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
Londoner and Bedford and Bo you know
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
they have a lot of kids they have a lot
 
00:23:10.269 --> 00:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
of expensive homes right and we send
 
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
them now next to nothing right but we
 
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
could you know so so that's the
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
motivation for voting for this bill
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
right let the legislature decide what's
 
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
the appropriate amount to send to to
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
Local Schools right we're
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
not um we're never going to forget Local
 
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
Schools they're a subdivision of the
 
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
state right I mean it's not like if
 
00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:39.400 align:start position:0%
without this we would never send any
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
money to to Local Schools it's
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
ridiculous right this is just um the
 
00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:50.919 align:start position:0%
courts wanting a particular outcome and
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
you know trying to enforce it on us when
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
it when it doesn't make sense what we're
 
00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
doing now makes sense
 
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
but what the The Logical conclusion of
 
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
the of the conval ruling does not and
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:24:08.669 --> 00:24:08.679 align:start position:0%
um so that's
 
00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:11.799 align:start position:0%
the I'm I'm happy to answer questions
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
witness wow seeing none so I I guess I
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
have all right here's what um first of
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
all I have to say I'm very sympathetic
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
to what you want to accomplish I mean I
 
00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:30.950 align:start position:0%
to what you want to accomplish I mean I
you

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
know I think the Claremont decision was
 
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
the wrong decision and it was I very
 
00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
much agree with with uh attorney
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
sorg's analysis but having said that why
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
it it seems to me and I I I I say this
 
00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
very respectfully but it it seems to me
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
that the what you're doing is kind of a
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
cutesy yes way of why not if you want if
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
you you want to
 
00:25:04.389 --> 00:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
say the the state should have
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
no if you want to say I I assume you
 
00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
want to say one of two things one
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps you want to say the state should
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
have um uh no responsibility to fund it
 
00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
should be a local uh decision to to
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
decide on funding of Education or or
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
maybe more
 
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
specifically that the legislature
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
decides how much money should be spent
 
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
on education and the courts can't review
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
that if that's what you want to say why
 
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:35.720 align:start position:0%
not just put why not just say that okay
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
so why don't I have one that crosses out
 
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
the word public and just writes the word
 
00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
private right and leaves everything else
 
00:25:47.549 --> 00:25:47.559 align:start position:0%
the same right that that would work um
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
or why don't I do a more detailed thing
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
we part of it
 
00:25:57.149 --> 00:25:57.159 align:start position:0%
is the way I look at it is that the
 
00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
problem here here is not our
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
constitution there's nothing wrong with
 
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
our constitution it's well written it's
 
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
it's historical it's nice right the
 
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
problem here is the Supreme
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
Court misinterpreting it all right so
 
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
therefore changing the Constitution in
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
my mind is sort of like accepting the
 
00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
premise right that the constitution says
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
what they say it says therefore I have
 
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
to change it right it and as opposed to
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
this amendment doesn't change the
 
00:26:38.389 --> 00:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
Constitution really but it makes the
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
point right you see what I mean so
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
there's nothing wrong with the
 
00:26:44.389 --> 00:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
Constitution therefore why should we
 
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
have to change it okay so I agree with
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
you I mean if if you felt like amending
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
it and you thought it could pass with an
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
amendment the the problem is we've tried
 
00:26:56.389 --> 00:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
that before you know years ago when I
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
was in the legislature the for the first
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
time we did that but we got hung up over
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
the details of the language right
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
somebody had their right the way they
 
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
wrote it the way this one wrote it the
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
way that one wrote it and and and we
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
could never get it done right and so
 
00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:14.909 align:start position:0%
could never get it done right and so
this

00:27:14.909 --> 00:27:14.919 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
one that's my answer all right so it
 
00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the problem isn't the
 
00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
so other
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
question any other uh yes representative
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
St I I wish I had some questions but
 
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of stuff here and um but
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to reflect a little bit
 
00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
before I ask a
 
00:27:44.909 --> 00:27:44.919 align:start position:0%
question I remember when the first
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
Claremont lawsuit was talked about
 
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:51.640 align:start position:0%
initiating and I was in the auditorium
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
in Claremont New Hampshire and I was one
 
00:27:56.909 --> 00:27:56.919 align:start position:0%
of the few that stood up and opposed to
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
it and I think I said something what are
 
00:28:02.669 --> 00:28:02.679 align:start position:0%
we citizens suing citizens over what the
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
other thought that came to mind is
 
00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:08.519 align:start position:0%
Governor Lynch did not he ask for a
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
revision so that we could avoid um what
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
ensued after over the last 30 years um
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
get away from and recognize that the
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
cherish was aspirational and not a
 
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:25.720 align:start position:0%
financial mandate did you talk about
 
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
that a little bit um I can't say
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
specifically govern about Governor Lynch
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
I don't remember that that
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
detail um but yes I mean this is not the
 
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
first such such Constitutional Amendment
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
that's come before your committee and
 
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
and the legislature so there have been
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
attempts and I remember one very well my
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
first term was when uh Bill O'Brien was
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
speaker right we had a super Republican
 
00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
majority right almost 3 to one and yet
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
we couldn't pass anything right so and
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
the problem was it got hung up on should
 
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
I say this or that or you know whatever
 
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
so so that's the problem you're going to
 
00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:11.559 align:start position:0%
run into if you try to amend
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
things yes yes please so um looking at
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
the handouts and I got to reread them
 
00:29:21.149 --> 00:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
but it appears as though um the
 
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
direction is take the constitution in
 
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
the context of language and culture
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
as it was then written as a as opposed
 
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
to looking back and revising meaning by
 
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
any changes of
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
constitution um or any changes in
 
00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
culture excuse me yeah and and I think
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
from from my feeling that was what we
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
did at the very beginning we weren't
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
putting it in context um do I have this
 
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
right that that you're stressing the
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
context of uh language and culture at
 
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
the time absolutely yeah so that part
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
that's one thing the ruling itself talks
 
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
about by the way um the ruling uses a
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
1784 dictionary if anybody wanted to
 
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
look up a copy of such dictionary it
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
exists online and I could send links to
 
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh to the committee and and you could
 
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:18.200 align:start position:0%
look up your own set of words if you
 
00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to you know
 
00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
Smith good morning first of all I have
 
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
to say that I always
 
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
enjoy listening to you doesn't mean I
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
agree with you
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
but sometimes I do I always enjoy
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
listening to you and it gives me another
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
perspective um uh sometimes we believe
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
that the literal interpretation of the
 
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution is what should guide us
 
00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes we believe that that that is
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
not what should guide us and to me that
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
is the strength of the Constitution it
 
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
is very
 
00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
elastic and it has by and large
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
survived for a few centuries recognizing
 
00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.389 align:start position:0%
survived for a few centuries recognizing
that

00:31:15.389 --> 00:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
elasticity I do want to respond to my
 
00:31:22.269 --> 00:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
colleague's question I was
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
chairman of the finance
 
00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:28.919 align:start position:0%
committee a number of years ago
 
00:31:33.149 --> 00:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
and I had always opposed a
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment to try to get
 
00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:39.559 align:start position:0%
the state out of honoring it's what I
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
believe is its obligation to pay for P
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
public education and because I'm an
 
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
American I use the American
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
Republic um and most of my Democratic
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
colleagues agreed Governor Lynch
 
00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:01.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
office he very much wanted a
 
00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.549 align:start position:0%
office he very much wanted a
constitutional

00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
amendment we worked very very hard to
 
00:32:17.629 --> 00:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
try to come up with an amendment
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
legislature we finally came up with Lang
 
00:32:30.629 --> 00:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
langage that people could live with not
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
happily but could live
 
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
with and
 
00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.710 align:start position:0%
with and
I

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
asked my colleagues on the Democratic
 
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
side I said I have never asked for a
 
00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
vote before and I will never ask for a
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
vote again but I am asking for one vote
 
00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
will you give us one vote on this and
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
they agreed and I then went to the
 
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
speaker and to the uh Republican leader
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
and I
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
said one vote is all I could guarantee
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
and in fact
 
00:33:15.149 --> 00:33:15.159 align:start position:0%
um uh if you wanted to try to amend this
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
you would not get support so please
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
don't be greedy please realize that you
 
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
can get something close to what you want
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
we could get something close to what we
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
want and could get that
 
00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:32.919 align:start position:0%
through and I said it twice to the
 
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
majority leader or to whatever he was no
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
he wasn't the majority leader the
 
00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:39.799 align:start position:0%
minority leader and I said would you
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
shake hands on this and he
 
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
agreed and we made the
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
motion and it
 
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
passed and the next thing that
 
00:33:58.029 --> 00:33:58.039 align:start position:0%
happened is that he stood up to
 
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
amendment you can go back and check and
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
verify what I've told you and that is
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
why it was
 
00:34:15.069 --> 00:34:15.079 align:start position:0%
shortterm partisan
 
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:18.599 align:start position:0%
greediness that interfered with us being
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
able to address an issue that all the
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
these years later is still with us and
 
00:34:27.149 --> 00:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
it's a lesson that I think we should all
 
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
be reminded of I apologize for not
 
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
asking a question um Mr Mr
 
00:34:38.829 --> 00:34:38.839 align:start position:0%
chair would you believe uh well no I
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
could do that but I'm not going to you
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
know because the truth I can laugh about
 
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:47.919 align:start position:0%
it but I'm not amused um it to me stands
 
00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:54.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.349 --> 00:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
try well we try to to do more than we
 
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
should and
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
um so now that who I was one of those
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
people who now you know the story I
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
don't remember who used to say that who
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
used to say that Paul Harvey Paul Harvey
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
PA Harvey the story um and that is the
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
story and that is why I love listening
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
to you but I'm constantly reminded about
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that this is not a laughing
 
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
matter this is not not something to be
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
cute about this is the
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
Constitution that has by and large stood
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
Us in good stad and I can't wait to hear
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
the next bill that you bring to us well
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I the compliment
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
goes the other way as well I mean I I I
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
am happy to hopefully be your friend and
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
and uh um I always like to listen to you
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
including this um this is very
 
00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
informative um
 
00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
and and you're right the the perfect is
 
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
the enemy of the good right I mean it's
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
that simple representative
 
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
Greece thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
representative at first I thought this
 
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:12.280 align:start position:0%
was cockamamy but I appreciate your
 
00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
explanation of this and it goes way back
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh to in time long before I be moved to
 
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um but my question is
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
because the state mandates that children
 
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
attend school we have comp cul
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
attendance does that then not obligate
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
the state to provide financing for such
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
an Endeavor if you're going to mandate
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
it you got to pay for it yeah thank you
 
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
for the question I would
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
say in
 
00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
general all parts of government are
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
essentially parts of the state we call
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
schools political subdivisions of the
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
state right towns are political
 
00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
subdivisions of the state so the state
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
has set up a structure
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
where certain taxes are collected
 
00:37:02.589 --> 00:37:02.599 align:start position:0%
locally and spent locally and other
 
00:37:05.309 --> 00:37:05.319 align:start position:0%
taxes are collected globally and and
 
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
spent however they're spent and so you
 
00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:10.839 align:start position:0%
know in some sense the state is
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
fulfilling that obligation it's just in
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
a way that um you know obviously this is
 
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
all a giant political question and we
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
change the formula every two years and
 
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
we you know change taxes every two years
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
and all that sort of stuff so so I would
 
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
say the state
 
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
is funding education but they're doing
 
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
it in a certain way that this particular
 
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court disagreed with right other
 
00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.630 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court disagreed with right other
other

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Wallace
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and thanks for taking my
 
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
question would it be a fair analysis um
 
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
to say that this is really not a a
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
cutesy move but in fact giving the New
 
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire voters a position to reinforce
 
00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
um their position and enforce the
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
Constitution by uh replacing the word
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
cherish and reminding everybody involved
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
that the power that we drive derive from
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
our citizens are who's uh paying the
 
00:38:08.109 --> 00:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
bill here and that's really needs to be
 
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
considered in this would you agree with
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
that yeah I um I'm going to recruit you
 
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:15.640 align:start position:0%
for the campaign to get this passed if
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
it ever gets on the ballot that's a very
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
nice way of putting um I don't know if
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
you have other pink cards but I know
 
00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
we're we're running out of time so maybe
 
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
uh should any other
 
00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing none thank
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
you very much you I'm next going to call
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
please good morning to the committee and
 
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um for the record my name is
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
Representative Keith Ammon and I
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsboro District 42 Town's
 
00:38:58.589 --> 00:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
uh new B and Mount Vernon line bro I'm
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
going to keep my comments extremely
 
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
brief there's another Constitutional
 
00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment down the hall that I'm also a
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on I'd like to get to that
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
one um i' just like to make a singular
 
00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
point and that has to do with um the
 
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:17.720 align:start position:0%
potential for The Logical conclusion of
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
the Claremont decisions one and two and
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
the conil
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
decisions as the state uh takes a larger
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
and larger role in paying for local
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
education it has the potential to
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
undermine local control if we if we plot
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
out the dots on the graph it seems that
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
the the trend is for the state to pick
 
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
up a larger and larger portion of of
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
funding of our local
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
education um and that's the point I'd
 
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
like to make here that um for 200
 
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
years that article 83 was interpreted a
 
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
certain way and within the last few
 
00:39:58.109 --> 00:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
decades that has
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
changed and now uh there's a movement
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
and there's a a fairly large political
 
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
movement because of the burden of our
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
property taxes uh for the state you know
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
the promise is if the state pays more
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
our our local property taxes will go
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
down um that that may be a du a dubious
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
promise but if the trend continues and
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
the state picks up a larger portion um
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's how the world works the who who
 
00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
writes the check the rules right that's
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
sort of a an axiom that is true most of
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
the time um and
 
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
so unless we uh consider carefully the
 
00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:40.839 align:start position:0%
legislature's role in um responding to
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
Court decisions uh we may just be
 
00:40:47.309 --> 00:40:47.319 align:start position:0%
accumulating more power for ourselves at
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
the state legislature level and taking
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
power away from local school boards and
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
their decisions so I just that that's
 
00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
the one point that I'd like to make
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire is a hard act to
 
00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
follow so I'm not even going to try um
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
one one ancillary
 
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
consideration is that our education
 
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
Freedom account
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
system uh will have more
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
money uh if the state pays a larger
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
portion so
 
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
indirectly uh we could be funding our
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts to a higher
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
level and maybe that's something that
 
00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:28.839 align:start position:0%
hasn't been considered so um I would
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
like to get down the hall so I'll I'll
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
briefly take
 
00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you so much for being
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
willing to be here and understand you
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
pulled in a lot of directions um are you
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we are a local control
 
00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
State isn't it true that the local
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions in this state only have
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
the power that is given to them by the
 
00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.829 align:start position:0%
the power that is given to them by the
state

00:41:56.829 --> 00:41:56.839 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so we are a
 
00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
dyan's rule state as you're I'm sure
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
you're aware um but the cultural
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
traditions of our state we we defer to
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
local control whenever possible so there
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
there so technically yes the the local
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
towns can do have to do whatever we tell
 
00:42:16.589 --> 00:42:16.599 align:start position:0%
them to do but
 
00:42:20.549 --> 00:42:20.559 align:start position:0%
traditionally for a very long time we we
 
00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
defer to local control because we
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
understand decision- making closer to
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
where the decisions are made has a
 
00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
better outcome so I would say
 
00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:32.359 align:start position:0%
technically correct but traditionally
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's a little different thank you

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:02.510 align:start position:0%

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:54.870 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.880 --> 00:48:37.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:39.400 align:start position:0%
now Beyond 9:45 I'm going to open the

1169 I'm not a sponsor of but with that
 
00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:05.599 align:start position:0%
I won't take questions thank you thank
 
00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
you um do we have
 
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
um anyone here who wishes to be I have a
 
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.069 --> 00:49:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
y good morning chairman and and the to
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
the committee as well um my name is Anie
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
Malachi I am the executive director of
 
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
the commission for human rights um and
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
the content of
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
1169 um in essence what it's doing is
 
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
creating a private right of action for
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on uh someone's
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
hair and so the first first first
 
00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
element for me is the concern about the
 
00:50:03.069 --> 00:50:03.079 align:start position:0%
private right of action so what that is
 
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
effectively doing is removing the
 
00:50:07.789 --> 00:50:07.799 align:start position:0%
commission from the process although it
 
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
is putting the language the
 
00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:13.079 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination language into the
 
00:50:16.109 --> 00:50:16.119 align:start position:0%
commission's definitions it is removing
 
00:50:19.069 --> 00:50:19.079 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for the commission to
 
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
provide um Justice if you will or to to
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
stop us from being able to take a charge
 
00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
based on uh on that uh basis it does
 
00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:31.839 align:start position:0%
allow I believe in terms of education
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
for us to do that however what I could
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
potentially see here is a quite a bit of
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
confusion um people do contact us uh to
 
00:50:43.789 --> 00:50:43.799 align:start position:0%
ask questions for technical assistance
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
based on what the anti-discrimination
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
law contains at this point and so if
 
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
this definition is included in the law
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
then I could foresee them calling us for
 
00:50:55.549 --> 00:50:55.559 align:start position:0%
questions uh to to get guidance and an
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
assistance of course we don't provide
 
00:50:59.789 --> 00:50:59.799 align:start position:0%
legal advice but we would not have the
 
00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:01.720 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to provide any training or
 
00:51:04.589 --> 00:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
assistance relative to anything else in
 
00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
the statute other than education
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
possibly um the next part for for the
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
commission is the commission is already
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh able to take charges in this area we
 
00:51:20.789 --> 00:51:20.799 align:start position:0%
have jurisdiction over this area and uh
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
specifically under ra it could be taken
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%
under race it could be taken under
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
gender uh it could be taken under sexual
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
orientation it could be taken under age
 
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
it could be taken Under Disability uh
 
00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
and uh national origin and actually
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
actually also religion and so if the
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
language is put in the statute but
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
removed and only for um
 
00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
employment then the protection that
 
00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
other people may have has been removed
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
and it's not this protection that we
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
already have in the statute is for all
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
people so anyone any religion
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
not based on race specifically but any
 
00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:01.480 align:start position:0%
hairstyle whether it's beards because
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
that's not mentioned as well some
 
00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:05.720 align:start position:0%
individuals may have uh long beards
 
00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
based on their religion or it could be
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
their uh national origin um siks for
 
00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
example would wear a turban so would
 
00:52:14.589 --> 00:52:14.599 align:start position:0%
would we take it under national origin
 
00:52:16.349 --> 00:52:16.359 align:start position:0%
or would we take that under religion so
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
there's um the other part too is there's
 
00:52:20.829 --> 00:52:20.839 align:start position:0%
a lot that's not covered with this and
 
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh for us at the commission we just want
 
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure that everyone in the state
 
00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:26.839 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire who may feel like
 
00:52:28.589 --> 00:52:28.599 align:start position:0%
they've been discriminated against can
 
00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
find themselves in the law and not have
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
a carve out for one group and not allow
 
00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:35.720 align:start position:0%
another group which would be
 
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
discriminatory on its face so I am w i
 
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
welcome any questions that you might
 
00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
have questions for this witness
 
00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
representative Perez I apologize I did
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
not hear where you were from and I
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
apologize no worries the uh human the
 
00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:53.799 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission thank you other
 
00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
qu yes representative Alexander um thank
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and just so thank you Miss
 
00:52:59.549 --> 00:52:59.559 align:start position:0%
Malachi for being here just to make this
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
clear you believe that if we pass this
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
bill it will actually undermine the
 
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
rights of those that it's actually
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
trying to help correct yes uh it would
 
00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
not only remove the jurisdiction
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
specifically in employment from the
 
00:53:15.549 --> 00:53:15.559 align:start position:0%
commission people would have to go to
 
00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
court versus coming to us but it would
 
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
it it leaves out other individuals and
 
00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
other types of hair which could make
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
people not file a charge should they be
 
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
discriminated against thank you right
 
00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness seeing
 
00:53:34.349 --> 00:53:34.359 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much thank you all
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
um next I'm going to call on uh
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
please thank you representative Lynn
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
chairman Lynn members of the committee
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
ranking member Smith I had to grab two
 
00:53:56.349 --> 00:53:56.359 align:start position:0%
witnesses in Manchester who are coming
 
00:53:58.030 --> 00:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
right now they're parking my car for me
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate representative Alexander
 
00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
You introducing the bill for me and I
 
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:07.240 align:start position:0%
apologize for my tardiness um I did not
 
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
was not reached out by that commission
 
00:54:11.789 --> 00:54:11.799 align:start position:0%
and did not hear where she was from uh
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
but would be happy to work with her on
 
00:54:16.589 --> 00:54:16.599 align:start position:0%
an amendment to make this bill work I
 
00:54:18.789 --> 00:54:18.799 align:start position:0%
think that the crown Act is an important
 
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation it has been passed
 
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:23.720 align:start position:0%
in over 22 States because people
 
00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:26.200 align:start position:0%
recognize that this is an issue that
 
00:54:28.589 --> 00:54:28.599 align:start position:0%
people are facing in our communities
 
00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
people who have different types of hair
 
00:54:34.589 --> 00:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
than uh we normally like to see and uh I
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
know this because I faced it myself uh I
 
00:54:40.829 --> 00:54:40.839 align:start position:0%
worked at a restaurant in petero for a
 
00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
long time about two is years and uh my
 
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
mother worked there as well and in my
 
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
final two weeks of working there uh my
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
mother had been talked to a number of
 
00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
times by the manager nice guy decent guy
 
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
not a great manager he talked to her a
 
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
couple of times uh about my hair whether
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
or not I would be able to do it and I it
 
00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
just to be clear my hair was uh a little
 
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
different than it was right now less
 
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
long um uh my hair is well kept I like
 
00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
to think my hair is well kept now was
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
then I always kept it up kept it
 
00:55:19.309 --> 00:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
straight wasn't touching it um and I had
 
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
friends that worked there friends of
 
00:55:23.069 --> 00:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
mine that worked there that had that uh
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
that flop that some some of our boys
 
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
some of your sons might have it uh see
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
sort of Representative Kenny right there
 
00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
he kind of I'm sure he understands what
 
00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about although yours is
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
jelled up um but they were you know
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
touching their hair the whole time and
 
00:55:41.789 --> 00:55:41.799 align:start position:0%
and that wasn't a problem for for the
 
00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:44.680 align:start position:0%
manager or the staff but for some reason
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
my hair which was put up was and and my
 
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
mom was asked uh three or four times
 
00:55:51.789 --> 00:55:51.799 align:start position:0%
whether or not I'd be able to do
 
00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
something with my hair meaning cut it
 
00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:57.640 align:start position:0%
and she told them off and as a result
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
she on I think it was like a Thursday
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
that that week was told to go home early
 
00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:05.559 align:start position:0%
and then uh I was brought into the back
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
office at the end of my shift and told
 
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
that I didn't have enough spunk anymore
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
and uh anyone who has worked a service
 
00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
job knows that after two years of
 
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:19.240 align:start position:0%
working that job uh you might not be as
 
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic but you're still do I I was
 
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
I I considered myself a good worker and
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
I think the other people there did
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
as well I don't think that was the
 
00:56:29.829 --> 00:56:29.839 align:start position:0%
reason for it and my manager who fired
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
me told me something that I will never
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
forget um it was uh the most one of the
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
most condescending things that's ever
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
been told to me he said Jonah you're
 
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
great you're made for the White House
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
not the waterhous and uh I just you know
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
I think he was putting in an
 
00:56:50.029 --> 00:56:50.039 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable situation where he was
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
told that he had to get rid of me and so
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
he was trying to do that as best he
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
could but but this is is something that
 
00:56:58.589 --> 00:56:58.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of people go through in our state
 
00:57:00.309 --> 00:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
and I I spoke to a lot of people about
 
00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:01.720 align:start position:0%
this I have two people like I said
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
they're parking my car right now who are
 
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
coming one of them a loctician who does
 
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
my hair and the other uh someone who has
 
00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839 align:start position:0%
a lot of personal stories who they who
 
00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
can relay some of the stories of the
 
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
people in Manchester and and other
 
00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%
places here in our state that are facing
 
00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
this they're facing it in school they're
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
facing it at work and and and this is an
 
00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
issue which needs to be addressed so as
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
I'm open to working with the committee
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
in whatever way possible and I know that
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
representative Linda Harriet goth who
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
would have love to be here right now but
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
is working very hard uh on a on a
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
personal family stuff and and other
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
legislative business that has to do with
 
00:57:44.829 --> 00:57:44.839 align:start position:0%
criminal justice is going to have a
 
00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:47.240 align:start position:0%
number of people from NASA people who do
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
hair salon work and other folks who have
 
00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
personal stories to to send their
 
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
letters to the committee throughout the
 
00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:55.640 align:start position:0%
process of this week so I would just
 
00:57:58.829 --> 00:57:58.839 align:start position:0%
hope that uh there would be some way if
 
00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
there is some uh language concern here
 
00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
although I didn't necessarily see that
 
00:58:07.029 --> 00:58:07.039 align:start position:0%
in my read of the bill although freshman
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
so you know give me space to to make
 
00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
mistakes on that end uh I would be happy
 
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
to work to address those concerns in
 
00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
whatever way the committee sees fit and
 
00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
katat thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
you representative wheeler for coming in
 
00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
and introducing this bill and I'm so
 
00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
sorry that these things happen to
 
00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
you did you know that the Human Rights
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
Commission was available when this
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
happened to you and if so did you file a
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
complaint with them when this happened
 
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
no I don't think that uh uh I don't
 
00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
think there's a
 
00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:51.400 align:start position:0%
good I wasn't aware that that that they
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
were available and I I didn't know that
 
00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
there was a recourse to to be able to
 
00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
get this done I I was told that um there
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
was no recourse for me to address that
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
because there was no uh place in law for
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
for me in the Discrimination law to get
 
00:59:08.029 --> 00:59:08.039 align:start position:0%
that done if I wasn't aware of the Human
 
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission yes follow up yes
 
00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
um so with that in mind and the fact
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
that we're told from the director of The
 
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission that this is C
 
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
covered under current statute do you
 
00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:25.309 align:start position:0%
covered under current statute do you
think

00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:26.839 align:start position:0%
that the issue may be more of an
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
educational issue or maybe people need
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
to be made aware
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
that this law does exist and that there
 
00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:35.720 align:start position:0%
are protections against these things
 
00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
because if this is happening on a
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
regular basis and it's it it is included
 
00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
in law broadly to not not be allowed
 
00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:45.400 align:start position:0%
then it seems as if we need to get the
 
00:59:46.589 --> 00:59:46.599 align:start position:0%
word out there and the message out there
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
to stop it from happening well
 
00:59:50.349 --> 00:59:50.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely I mean I I I still think it
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
would be a good thing to to carve it out
 
00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
and make it specific um might be my
 
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
position on that but I think you know
 
00:59:58.750 --> 00:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
whatever happens it would be a good
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
thing to get education out there about
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
the law as it currently stands and what
 
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
recourse people can take on this thank
 
01:00:07.029 --> 01:00:07.039 align:start position:0%
you other questions for this we yes
 
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton please just to
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
be clear are you opposed to this bill as
 
01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
written and saying it needs an amendment
 
01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:17.720 align:start position:0%
for you to support it no I mean I I
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
would have to uh go back and see the
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
testimony of the humans right Human
 
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission um but uh I I I worked
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
decently hard on on this language um and
 
01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
I I confident in it um but I would have
 
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
to look at the testimony of the Human
 
01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:37.720 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission and see what they said
 
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
and and see what amendments could be
 
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
made from from what their perspective
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
was on the bill thank you other
 
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness you know I oh
 
01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:49.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes representative Landon
 
01:00:52.109 --> 01:00:52.119 align:start position:0%
please thank you for taking my question
 
01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
would this also include um
 
01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
uh coloring any coloring of the hair um
 
01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
with this you
 
01:01:04.349 --> 01:01:04.359 align:start position:0%
know this spill include anything about
 
01:01:07.109 --> 01:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
that well I believe the exact list uh
 
01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
protective hairstyles meaning hairstyles
 
01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
hair type braids locks tight coils curls
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
cornrow band knots afro afro twists and
 
01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
head wraps um I'm not sure if hair color
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
would be under hair type um but I feel
 
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
like that could be broadly defined
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
other yes representative Perez thank you
 
01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
question is this bill making it very
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
race specific and let me explain why I
 
01:01:40.829 --> 01:01:40.839 align:start position:0%
asked that I'm a product of the 60s
 
01:01:42.670 --> 01:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
everybody was judged by their hair if
 
01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
you had hair you were a hippie you know
 
01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
people were judged by their hair no
 
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
matter what their
 
01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
ethnicity is this meant specifically for
 
01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
people of
 
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
color and if it is I think we're leaving
 
01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
out another whole group that has
 
01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
discrimination perhaps against them
 
01:02:10.029 --> 01:02:10.039 align:start position:0%
because of their hair whether it be I
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
don't know I keep thinking back to the
 
01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
60s but um is it meant
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
specifically for people of color no I I
 
01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
think that you know hairstyles or hair
 
01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
types is broadly defined to uh any race
 
01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:26.119 align:start position:0%
whatsoever I think it's just talking
 
01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
about natural hairstyles you know so you
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
can't I can't discriminate you against
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
you if you have a a floppy hair or I
 
01:02:35.789 --> 01:02:35.799 align:start position:0%
can't discriminate you against against
 
01:02:38.349 --> 01:02:38.359 align:start position:0%
you if if you have uh uh braids or locks
 
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
or something along those lines and I
 
01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
think the concern is right now that um
 
01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
despite there being a broad def
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
definition of this in law that people
 
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
with braids locks sort of Afro style
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
types hair which you know not are not
 
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
always African people um that they're
 
01:02:59.470 --> 01:02:59.480 align:start position:0%
being discriminated against uh in the
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
workplace and at school and other places
 
01:03:05.309 --> 01:03:05.319 align:start position:0%
so I think that's why when hair styles
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
and hair types after that is uh laid out
 
01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
in the bill on line 10 it goes through
 
01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:13.720 align:start position:0%
braids locks tight corals Etc and I see
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
how that could be misconstrued as people
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
of color but I think it is sort of
 
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
broadly defined just uh humans in
 
01:03:23.789 --> 01:03:23.799 align:start position:0%

this Witness yes representative Manos
 
01:03:28.109 --> 01:03:28.119 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question one of the um uh
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
questions that the director of The Human
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission raised is facial hair
 
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
and beards and I just wondered if you um
 
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
had any perspective of on that in terms
 
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.430 align:start position:0%

um

01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:49.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
and facial hair and beards as in
 
01:03:54.589 --> 01:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
including facial hair and beards or just
 
01:03:54.599 --> 01:03:56.190 align:start position:0%
including facial hair and beards or just
discrimination

01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
discrimination um based on the fact that
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
men um have facial hair or beards for
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
examp she used the example of a seik um
 
01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
or for example an orthodox Jew other
 
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
situations where discrimination could
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
occur based on facial hair or beards I
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
think that that would be an appropriate
 
01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
Amendment for the legislation I think
 
01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
you know facial hair and beards
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes are you know as you just laid
 
01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
out in some cases religious and and you
 
01:04:26.269 --> 01:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
know spiritual in nature and so I think
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
it would be good to have that in the
 
01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:30.269 align:start position:0%
it would be good to have that in the
bill

01:04:30.269 --> 01:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:33.079 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes representative for thank
 
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
you I'm sorry thanks for taking my
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
question there are certain circumstances
 
01:04:44.309 --> 01:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
where um for reasons of um hygiene or
 
01:04:48.910 --> 01:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
reasons of um for medical reasons or
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
because of um sterilization and
 
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
cleanliness that hair can become an
 
01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:56.549 align:start position:0%
cleanliness that hair can become an
issue

01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:59.309 --> 01:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
um I became a nurse in the 60s you could
 
01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
not have your hair
 
01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:05.720 align:start position:0%
below your fa line because you could
 
01:05:09.789 --> 01:05:09.799 align:start position:0%
does this exempt those places from being
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
able to um say well you cannot have that
 
01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
particular style without perhaps
 
01:05:21.069 --> 01:05:21.079 align:start position:0%
covering it or doing this or that for
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
those particular types places I'm not
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
trying to be hard to get along but I I
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
see I see situations where um having to
 
01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
cover your is this going to stop people
 
01:05:32.319 --> 01:05:33.109 align:start position:0%
cover your is this going to stop people
from

01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
saying you're in an environment where we
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
need your head covered hair covered and
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
your facial hair covered in this
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
environment is this going to mean that
 
01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:47.839 align:start position:0%
businesses or institutions cannot say
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
that that's a concern no I don't I don't
 
01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
I don't think so I appreciate that
 
01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
concern and I I I think that there are
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
places in which it's simply the policy
 
01:05:59.029 --> 01:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
of the place and not discrimination you
 
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
know this applies to everybody and for
 
01:06:05.069 --> 01:06:05.079 align:start position:0%
you know safety standards for um like
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
you said sanitation cleanliness
 
01:06:09.269 --> 01:06:09.279 align:start position:0%
standards whether it's a a laboratory or
 
01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
or something along those lines you're
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
working with hazardous material or
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
something like that you know there there
 
01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.710 align:start position:0%
something like that you know there there
are

01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
uh concessions that you as an individual
 
01:06:21.549 --> 01:06:21.559 align:start position:0%
need to make to be able to work at those
 
01:06:23.710 --> 01:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
places and and you know whether that's a
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
Time constraint or you have to change
 
01:06:27.549 --> 01:06:27.559 align:start position:0%
your hair or what whatever that might be
 
01:06:30.029 --> 01:06:30.039 align:start position:0%
those concessions are agreed to at the
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
point of um employment exactly so I I
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
would that that I think it it doesn't
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
cover that and I think that's uh that's
 
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
clear in the
 
01:06:41.309 --> 01:06:41.319 align:start position:0%
bill other questions for this witness
 
01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton yeah thank you
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question let's go back to
 
01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
the restaurant where you were
 
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
working did you have to wear a uniform a
 
01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
cap were you in kitchen or serving uh
 
01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
what what was the environment like there
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
brought this on well I I mean we did
 
01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:02.200 align:start position:0%
have to wear black so that's technically
 
01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
a uniform we had to wear black shirt and
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
black pants um but we weren't forced to
 
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
wear a cap as I said there were other
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
people with uh longer hair much more
 
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
greasier than mine much much uh more in
 
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
their face than than mine was that uh
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%
did not also have to wear cap and we're
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
not we're not talked to in any way uh
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
whatsoever I spoke to them about this um
 
01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:29.480 align:start position:0%
I was a a bus boy and and a food Runner
 
01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
um so I was in the front of the house
 
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
sort of just just with people and and
 
01:07:38.109 --> 01:07:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:38.119 --> 01:07:39.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:43.269 --> 01:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
yes were were these other people with
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
longer or variant sty styles of hair uh
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
approached and talk talked to um as you
 
01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:52.029 align:start position:0%
approached and talk talked to um as you
were

01:07:52.029 --> 01:07:52.039 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
no thank you
 
01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
other questions for yes representative
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
trip thank you for taking my question uh
 
01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
I was just
 
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
wondering uh when you were
 
01:08:09.309 --> 01:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
hired uh did you have long hair like you
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
had when you were
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
dismissed well hair grows so I I didn't
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
have exactly the long as long hair as as
 
01:08:20.829 --> 01:08:20.839 align:start position:0%
uh as I did but it was long it was long
 
01:08:25.349 --> 01:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
you know follow so the the the reason I
 
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
asked that question is I was just
 
01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
wondering uh they did not make uh your
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
hair a condition of employment did they
 
01:08:38.669 --> 01:08:38.679 align:start position:0%
no okay and and it was clear that I had
 
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
hair that you know would have grown and
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
you it was uh an off afro a dreaded afro
 
01:08:47.309 --> 01:08:47.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know what it necessarily would
 
01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
have been but it was clear that it would
 
01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
have been you know if it was an issue at
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
the time it would have been an issue
 
01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
that could have been a condition of
 
01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:54.349 align:start position:0%
that could have been a condition of
employment

01:08:54.349 --> 01:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
employment
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
well thank you for answering my question
 
01:08:58.269 --> 01:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
witness so I guess I do have a just one
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
or two questions uh representative wheer
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
um I'm the you have in the the bill uses
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
in quotes the term protective hairstyles
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if I I'm not sure that
 
01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:18.799 align:start position:0%
I understand what that mean in other
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
words is the is
 
01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
that should I understand that to mean
 
01:09:28.349 --> 01:09:28.359 align:start position:0%
that the the hairstyles are protective
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
in the sense that because of the texture
 
01:09:35.950 --> 01:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
of uh certain individuals here they need
 
01:09:38.189 --> 01:09:38.199 align:start position:0%
to they need
 
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
to use these other things like uh braids
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
locks tight Co tight coils or curls
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
because of the texture I'm not sure I
 
01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
understand what the term protective uh
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
hairstyles means I think I think you do
 
01:09:57.550 --> 01:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
I think you've got it right um as I see
 
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
here in line 16 protective hairstyles
 
01:10:02.669 --> 01:10:02.679 align:start position:0%
means hairstyles are hair type including
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
braids locks tight coils curls cornrows
 
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
Bantu BRS afro twists and head wrap I
 
01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
think that that um I think you've got it
 
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
right in that protective hairstyles
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
means uh a hairstyle that is protective
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
of like you said the hair but there also
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
is a loctician here who would be able to
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
better answer that question than I think
 
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
any of us so
 
01:10:33.149 --> 01:10:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
um okay uh other
 
01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
much Mr chairman I and I just I really
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate this this is a an important
 
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
conversation that needs to be had you
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
know I think that as I laid out in my
 
01:10:48.669 --> 01:10:48.679 align:start position:0%
testimony that this is something that
 
01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
does happen here in New Hampshire
 
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
there's a parallel Bill to this in the
 
01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
Senate you know we see some of our bills
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
get copied by the Senate a number of
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
times sure but um I'm hoping through the
 
01:10:59.790 --> 01:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
process of working here in the committee
 
01:11:01.709 --> 01:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to run down to OS at any
 
01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
time before the executive session and
 
01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
get an amendment that works for this
 
01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
bill because uh you know the crown act I
 
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
think is an important piece of
 
01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
legislation to pass here in the
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%

01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%

um and urge the committee to P to ought
 
01:12:01.390 --> 01:12:01.400 align:start position:0%
to pass it um so I wanted to share a
 
01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
quick story with you all um I had the
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
pleasure of going to high school right
 
01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
here in conquer right up the road at
 
01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
Bishop Brady High School and I was the
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
one of the only students of color um in
 
01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
my 400 plus uh school and one of the
 
01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
things that I I dealt with almost on the
 
01:12:24.189 --> 01:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
daily if not weekly um was uh getting
 
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
reprimanded for the state of my hair and
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
I've had all sorts of hairstyles as you
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
can see my hair is currently locked um
 
01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
and but I've had braids I've had
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
cornrows I've worn my hair in wraps all
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
sorts of things um and I wanted to also
 
01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
address um the chairman your question
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
about protective hairstyles um
 
01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely because of the texture of our
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
hair um I often tell people that this is
 
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
what my hair naturally wants to do uh I
 
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time straightening my
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
hair trying in very many ways actually
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
make it look like many of y'all hair um
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
because that's what my peers look like
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
that was what was most acceptable um
 
01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
when I was growing up and I certainly
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
didn't want to stand out and I took me a
 
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
long time to learn how to take care of
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
my hair um but while I was doing that it
 
01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
was not only a matter of trying to keep
 
01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
my hair neat and healthy it was also in
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
order to ensure that I wouldn't
 
01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
constantly be getting in trouble for my
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
hair so I went to a school with young
 
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
people um who would go on vacation you
 
01:13:27.229 --> 01:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
know with their families during spring
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
break uh during summer break and would
 
01:13:32.629 --> 01:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
come back with very similar hairstyles
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
to me um they would come back with
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
cornrow they would come back with braids
 
01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
with beads in their hair and they would
 
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
get very much applauded they would get
 
01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
you know praised for that hair um but
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
when I would sport the same hair I would
 
01:13:49.870 --> 01:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
get a lot of scrutiny I would get
 
01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
penalized I would be asked to change it
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
I would be and it honestly it might not
 
01:13:57.149 --> 01:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
seem like a big deal especially if
 
01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
you're not used to having to put your
 
01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
hair like put so much attention to your
 
01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
hair um but it absolutely impacted my
 
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
quality of studies it impacted my
 
01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
comfort my ability to feel as if I
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
belonged in my school it absolutely
 
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
impacted uh my ability to focus on what
 
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
was important and I think that's exactly
 
01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
what this bill is about it's making it's
 
01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
sending a message to New Hampshire res
 
01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
presidents to sending a message that
 
01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
says very clearly that we don't Brook
 
01:14:29.149 --> 01:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
discrimination when it comes to
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
hairstyles and I certainly have heard
 
01:14:33.709 --> 01:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
through testimony from um um
 
01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler um and from the
 
01:14:37.709 --> 01:14:37.719 align:start position:0%
the committee that this might not be
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
needed and I think that that's wonderful
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
if the fact is that the New Hampshire
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
statutes and law already cover um
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination for hairstyles based
 
01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:49.400 align:start position:0%
on the type of hairstyles then I think
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely that needs to become known
 
01:14:53.709 --> 01:14:53.719 align:start position:0%
because I work with young people um and
 
01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
they still undergo the same issues and I
 
01:14:57.669 --> 01:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
live in Manchester I'm a Manchester
 
01:14:59.550 --> 01:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
resident and if some of you don't know
 
01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
Manchester has some of has one of the
 
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
most diverse School populations um in
 
01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
the state and so I think it is really
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
important to send a message um that
 
01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
would imp because this one impacts young
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
people it impacts people and residents
 
01:15:15.189 --> 01:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
of this great state to make it known and
 
01:15:17.470 --> 01:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
make it clear that yes absolutely their
 
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
are policies and rules in terms of how a
 
01:15:22.510 --> 01:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
hair should be kept in order to perform
 
01:15:24.629 --> 01:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
certain job duties but I think the
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
reality is again when you have hair that
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
looks like mine you spend a lot of time
 
01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
justifying the state of your hair the
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
look of your hair and that does directly
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
impact your productivity your focus and
 
01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
as well as your sense that you do in
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
fact belong in the state even if you
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
don't look like every other person um
 
01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
especially those who are uh penalizing
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
you for that hair so I'm happy to take
 
01:15:50.910 --> 01:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
any questions happy to take any
 
01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
Reflections um and that is that is it
 
01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
for me
 
01:15:59.910 --> 01:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
me question uh yes representative
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%

01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
do to your hair this time it was
 
01:16:30.149 --> 01:16:30.159 align:start position:0%

honestly primarily the administrators
and

01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:31.400 align:start position:0%

it's also allowing me to show the
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
workforce and people around that don't
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
understand that our hair is not not M
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
maintainable it's you haven't seen it m
 
01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
maintain or not maintained before so
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
we're educating the world on today my
 
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
hair is messed up so you can see it's
 
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
messed up but tomorrow when I come in
 
01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
after I came from Roots natural hair
 
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
shop it's been maintained so you can see
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
the difference so now when someone comes
 
01:20:50.189 --> 01:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
in not maintain we have the we have the
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
right to say something because we know
 
01:20:53.550 --> 01:20:53.560 align:start position:0%
it's not maintain maintain unlike
 
01:20:55.390 --> 01:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
someone that comes in with the afro
 
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
somebody will automatically say oh this
 
01:20:58.750 --> 01:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
is not maintained but actually this
 
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
person went to The Hair Shop Roots
 
01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
natural hair shop by the way to get it
 
01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
washed cut and trimmed and poofed out
 
01:21:06.990 --> 01:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
properly so that it's not shedding all
 
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
over the table it's not out of order of
 
01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
a uniform and it looks presentable all
 
01:21:15.629 --> 01:21:15.639 align:start position:0%
the way around um I love my job I help a
 
01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:17.560 align:start position:0%

01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
helping them allows them to come to work
 
01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
places like this place here and
 
01:21:27.149 --> 01:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
especially like for Jonah he's one of my
 
01:21:29.470 --> 01:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
clients where when he first started he
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't comfortable wearing his locks
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
until I showed him look this is a nice
 
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
protective style where it looks
 
01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
professional so when you sit up here and
 
01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
present your bills and stuff you feel as
 
01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
powerful as you do with your hair so
 
01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:43.880 align:start position:0%

comes and it's uh combed well not Combs
 
01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
with palm roads and put back so that he
 
01:21:57.870 --> 01:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
looks professional at all times um also
 
01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:00.440 align:start position:0%

familiar with um railroad Factory um and
 
01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
Military environments safety is a big
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
issue and concern you've addressed that
 
01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
yes um because if you go into a machine
 
01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
shop and your your hair is like you were
 
01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
R for this morning that would be a
 
01:23:17.790 --> 01:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
safety right issue and violation for
 
01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
yourself In Harm's Way um as well as
 
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
problematic for the the business or or
 
01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:24.830 align:start position:0%
problematic for the the business or or
the

the
 
01:23:27.149 --> 01:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
organization um but it sounds like you
 
01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
you really are tuned into that safety
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%

goes I'm learning more ways to fit um
 
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
the workforce uh requirements because
 
01:23:44.189 --> 01:23:44.199 align:start position:0%
just like a electrician someone that has
 
01:23:46.669 --> 01:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
to get into a small compact space they
 
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
can't have their hair down or loose
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
because of it can get caught on
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
something or things like that and it's a
 
01:23:55.390 --> 01:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
health hazard for them to get dust and
 
01:23:57.629 --> 01:23:57.639 align:start position:0%
insulation in their hair so a lot of my
 
01:23:59.350 --> 01:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
clients we pull it back which is a
 
01:24:01.709 --> 01:24:01.719 align:start position:0%
protective style like cornrows or a
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
barrel twist to keep it pulled back so
 
01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
that these things don't get in the way
 
01:24:07.870 --> 01:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
and they they're not getting unhealthy
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
either so thank you you're welcome other
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative tur yeah thanks
 
01:24:16.629 --> 01:24:16.639 align:start position:0%
um uh at the outset I don't know if you
 
01:24:18.149 --> 01:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
are in the room but the the question
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
came up from our Human Rights Commission
 
01:24:21.950 --> 01:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
about whether this is is actually
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
covered and I guess I asked this
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
question because it sounds like from the
 
01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
other testimony we had you may come
 
01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
across lots of people who have
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
experienced this type of of uh workplace
 
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
or School push back um curious if you
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
the the idea of a Human Rights
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
Commission or or these sort of behaviors
 
01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
being subject to the human rights
 
01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
commission's purview had ever had ever
 
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
come up and and if um if that is is an
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity if not to to spread that
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
that message that was Wonder well I have
 
01:24:59.070 --> 01:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
had um some of the clients come to me
 
01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
and say you know well mostly from the
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
high schoolers that um you know they
 
01:25:05.149 --> 01:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
can't play the sport because their hair
 
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
is pulled down a certain way and I know
 
01:25:09.189 --> 01:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
that's coming from the higher ups and
 
01:25:11.310 --> 01:25:11.320 align:start position:0%
not just the the kids yourself um I
 
01:25:13.470 --> 01:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
never really had adults come to me and
 
01:25:15.070 --> 01:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
say the human rights services are
 
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
somebody in human services um complain
 
01:25:20.229 --> 01:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
and it's been a while too because uh
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
every day is changing so um but uh we I
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
think that just comes from us now having
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
certain bills passed and allowing things
 
01:25:32.189 --> 01:25:32.199 align:start position:0%
to like such as myself and natural hair
 
01:25:35.109 --> 01:25:35.119 align:start position:0%
styles I help pass uh House Bill 82 into
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
law so that I could perform uh hair
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
service to these people so that you know
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
these questions won't come up in the
 
01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
human rights um
 
01:25:46.109 --> 01:25:46.119 align:start position:0%
Department I don't know if I answer that
 
01:25:49.629 --> 01:25:49.639 align:start position:0%

01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:53.310 align:start position:0%
MOS thank you Mr chair thank you for
taking

01:25:53.310 --> 01:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
taking
 
01:25:55.629 --> 01:25:55.639 align:start position:0%
good morning um I wanted to ask you you
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
were using the term protective hairstyle
 
01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
yes and I I'm not familiar with that and
 
01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
what it means so I was just wondering if
 
01:26:04.229 --> 01:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
you could explain that okay a protective
 
01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
hairstyle is a style that is performed
 
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
on someone that wear their hair in a
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
natural state that where you don't have
 
01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
to touch it and it's uh put away so such
 
01:26:18.669 --> 01:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
as um example as my King's hair here
 
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
it's that's a protective stuff from him
 
01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
not keeping it down we don't have to
 
01:26:23.790 --> 01:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
retwisted every day he doesn't have to
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
wash it um brazer is another protective
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
style where it's pulled back and and
 
01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
pushed away for a while so you're not
 
01:26:32.830 --> 01:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
putting any heat you're not putting the
 
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
comb through it you're not well you do
 
01:26:37.229 --> 01:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
put products but not as much um just to
 
01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
give your hair a break and leave it
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
alone so for someone like yourself to
 
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
have your hair out today your protective
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
style I would choose as a pullback
 
01:26:48.270 --> 01:26:48.280 align:start position:0%
ponytail where we pull it back put in a
 
01:26:49.870 --> 01:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
bun and you'll leave your hair like that
 
01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
for like a week or so just so that
 
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
you're not combing putting stress on
 
01:26:56.109 --> 01:26:56.119 align:start position:0%
your scalp or your your hair shaft so
 
01:26:57.629 --> 01:26:57.639 align:start position:0%
that it's not shedding all over the
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
place and becoming a
 
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
problem you're welcome other questions
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%

support of the crown act um I've
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
throughout my life I've grew up between
 
01:27:58.990 --> 01:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
New York and Florida and I've always had
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
locks um this is this is
 
01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
my fourth set of locks throughout my
 
01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:08.639 align:start position:0%
lifetime I'm couple of times I was
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
forced to cut them because the back when
 
01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
I was uh when I first started the
 
01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
workforce um I'll be 42 in May um I know
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
I don't look it I know I don't look
 
01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
it and um so I came up um when I'm my
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
first job was a Denny in Florida and I
 
01:28:27.199 --> 01:28:28.070 align:start position:0%
first job was a Denny in Florida and I
was

01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
16 and um I had locks and the guy he
 
01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
said I love my personality he thinks I
 
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
fit the position very well um I just
 
01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
have to cut my hair in order to get the
 
01:28:42.159 --> 01:28:43.669 align:start position:0%
have to cut my hair in order to get the
job

01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
um eventually I was forced to I was uh I
 
01:28:49.149 --> 01:28:49.159 align:start position:0%
was forced to because if I didn't get
 
01:28:53.109 --> 01:28:53.119 align:start position:0%
the job then uh I would get locked up so
 
01:28:57.109 --> 01:28:57.119 align:start position:0%
I eventually had to cut my hair and
 
01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
um it devastated me I was I was I was
 
01:29:02.669 --> 01:29:02.679 align:start position:0%
pretty mad about it I end up quitting
 
01:29:05.070 --> 01:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
the job two weeks later which made it
 
01:29:06.750 --> 01:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
which made me even more upset but
 
01:29:09.189 --> 01:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
growing up these are the things that
 
01:29:12.189 --> 01:29:12.199 align:start position:0%
that um me and people like me had to
 
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
face you know I mean I remember reading
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
applications where it says if you have
 
01:29:18.830 --> 01:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
cornrows this these These are hairstyles
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
that are prohibited but like uh my Queen
 
01:29:24.510 --> 01:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
was saying earlier these are the
 
01:29:26.830 --> 01:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
protective styles that we need for our
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
hair to grow and be healthy you know and
 
01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
um so without being able to do that the
 
01:29:35.950 --> 01:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
only options we have is what we call a
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
Caesar cut a low cut fade or blow out
 
01:29:43.109 --> 01:29:43.119 align:start position:0%
you know and um that's not the look that
 
01:29:44.830 --> 01:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
we all want to have and that's not a
 
01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
look that that we all feel confident
 
01:29:52.270 --> 01:29:52.280 align:start position:0%
with you know so um I I do see um a lot
 
01:29:55.709 --> 01:29:55.719 align:start position:0%
of change since I was 16 but I feel like
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
we still we still got some ways to go
 
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
and um with this Crown act being passed
 
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
um that we're we're one more step
 
01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
towards uh
 
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
uh the true Solutions and and and and
 
01:30:14.430 --> 01:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
freedoms that that humans us as humans
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
should have period where everyone is is
 
01:30:26.350 --> 01:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
um everyone is is is is is considered
 
01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
and and being thought of um in the
 
01:30:32.350 --> 01:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
process of our
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
hair and so um that that's my time today
 
01:30:38.189 --> 01:30:38.199 align:start position:0%
if there's any questions I'll be more
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
than happy to answer representative
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
question I think it's absolutely
 
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
fabulous that there is an opportunity to
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
be able to do what you need to do for
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
your comfort for your hair for your
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
health of your hair I am sure that or I
 
01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
guess that it's probably not
 
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
affordable for the majority of young
 
01:31:10.750 --> 01:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
people and I just wonder do you
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
feel I I see this more protecting the
 
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
people who can't don't have the
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do what you all are doing
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
see it more as protecting the young
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
people who may be of color or
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
whatever who can't afford to go and do
 
01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
what they need to do exactly to maintain
 
01:31:38.109 --> 01:31:38.119 align:start position:0%
the health of their own hair what are
 
01:31:39.390 --> 01:31:39.400 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
that um yeah there's there's there's
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
quite a few people who um you know
 
01:31:51.189 --> 01:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
parents either are absent or um just
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
can't afford
 
01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
to to to to pay for the protective
 
01:31:59.470 --> 01:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
styles um we we see it more and more
 
01:32:01.830 --> 01:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
every day me and my queen like she's
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
phenomenal she she she does a lot of
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
um uh um I put this on the record but
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
you know when when when some when we see
 
01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
certain certain ones um that we know
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
they need it and they can't afford it we
 
01:32:22.109 --> 01:32:22.119 align:start position:0%
uh we figure something out you know we
 
01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
we we we make it happen because it's
 
01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's not the child's fault you know
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
um and sometimes it's not even the
 
01:32:31.629 --> 01:32:31.639 align:start position:0%
parents fault they only can afford what
 
01:32:35.310 --> 01:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
they can afford you know so um we uh or
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes we still do the uh my queen
 
01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:38.470 align:start position:0%
sometimes we still do the uh my queen
loves

01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
loves
 
01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
bartering and so you know we do a
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
service for a service you know um so we
 
01:32:47.070 --> 01:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
we do whatever we can to help those who
 
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
can't afford it to afford it you know um
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
and sometimes we just Do It free you
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
know and um just to look out for for the
 
01:32:58.510 --> 01:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
kids and some adults some adults
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
actually call and access also like you
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
know I would love this style but I just
 
01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
don't have the money for it right now
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
but my hair is like this and so my queen
 
01:33:08.669 --> 01:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
of talk to him and they'll figure
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
something out um I do wish we were able
 
01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
and and had some type of program
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
available that that to where um we'll be
 
01:33:22.990 --> 01:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
able to help more especially of our
 
01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
youth um we're out of Manchester so I I
 
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
wish there was something where we were
 
01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
able to um to to have some type of
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
program where we could bring the kids in
 
01:33:35.229 --> 01:33:35.239 align:start position:0%
and and they'll be able to get their
 
01:33:38.189 --> 01:33:38.199 align:start position:0%
hair um you know washed cleaned and and
 
01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
um done up in in some sort of protective
 
01:33:43.709 --> 01:33:43.719 align:start position:0%
style you know um without the cost
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
assist right I mean right now with with
 
01:33:50.669 --> 01:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
the demand um we we wouldn't be able to
 
01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
to uh um not say we wouldn't be able to
 
01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
pay our bills but we wouldn't have the
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
time cuz it's only my queen I don't do
 
01:34:03.109 --> 01:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
hair and so uh it's only my queen as The
 
01:34:06.390 --> 01:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
Stylist so and these protective styles
 
01:34:09.070 --> 01:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
some of these styles are anywhere from 2
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
to 10 hours um of sit time so we
 
01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to do so many because
 
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
we only we're we're Limited in um in
 
01:34:22.629 --> 01:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
Staffing and resources
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
but I would definitely love um if there
 
01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
was something there representative
 
01:34:31.629 --> 01:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
trip chair thank you for taking my
 
01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
question uh you like a couple of the
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
other people that have testified have
 
01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
have used the the phrase Crown act does
 
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
that mean
 
01:34:45.149 --> 01:34:45.159 align:start position:0%
something yes so the um we've been
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
fighting for this around the United
 
01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
States as the bipar community for some
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
years now and so the original the
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
original um bill that's what we called
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
it the crown act the crown of your head
 
01:34:58.709 --> 01:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
um and so uh instead of I think this is
 
01:35:03.629 --> 01:35:03.639 align:start position:0%
11 HB 1169 is the bill um we just we
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
just can we we just always put it
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
together with the crown act it's it's a
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
um another form of the crown act in the
 
01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire follow up uh so I
 
01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0%
imagine that the crown Act is a is a act
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
that is was enacted in another state yes
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
so there's there's uh we still got a
 
01:35:28.109 --> 01:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
couple of states for fighting yeah two
 
01:35:30.750 --> 01:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
other states 22 22 other states I'm
 
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:34.679 align:start position:0%
sorry so we still have we we we uh we
 
01:35:37.790 --> 01:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
still have some um um some ground to
 
01:35:41.790 --> 01:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
cover and and hopefully uh after today
 
01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire be uh be on that list with
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
the uh um 2022 other states that already
 
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
passed this Bill thank you thank you
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%

01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
we appreciate your testimony today
 
01:36:04.189 --> 01:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
because it uh informs us of things that
 
01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
we didn't know and it's quite helpful
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
and uh I appreciate you're doing that
 
01:36:11.629 --> 01:36:11.639 align:start position:0%
one question I had you mentioned your
 
01:36:14.830 --> 01:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
experience in Florida at age 16 what was
 
01:36:17.790 --> 01:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
that job I missed that oh Denny's it was
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
a Denny's restaurant okay thank you and
 
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
there was another um there's another
 
01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
young man I can't remember his name but
 
01:36:28.270 --> 01:36:28.280 align:start position:0%
it was big on the news um he was
 
01:36:30.629 --> 01:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
wrestling and he was wrestling um one of
 
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
his white uh peers um in a tournament
 
01:36:38.590 --> 01:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
and he was beating this guy and then the
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
referee stood him up and brought him to
 
01:36:44.109 --> 01:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
the sideline and said he had to cut his
 
01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
locks off cuz they were giving him some
 
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
type of advantage and he had to cut his
 
01:36:51.310 --> 01:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
locks off where he forfeits the match
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
and this was a championship this was a
 
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
high school championship match and
 
01:36:58.990 --> 01:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
eventually um you can you can watch this
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
video he's crying the whole time but he
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
cuts his locks because I mean he's
 
01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
worked his behind off to get to this
 
01:37:08.229 --> 01:37:08.239 align:start position:0%
level and to this stage at a state
 
01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
championship wrestling match and he had
 
01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
to cut his his his locks off on the side
 
01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
on the sideline U while everybody's
 
01:37:19.470 --> 01:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
watching him on the stadium um and he go
 
01:37:22.669 --> 01:37:22.679 align:start position:0%
he went on to win to win the match but
 
01:37:24.189 --> 01:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
um in my
 
01:37:26.830 --> 01:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
opinion uh uh he
 
01:37:30.189 --> 01:37:30.199 align:start position:0%
lost um because in the end he had to he
 
01:37:32.189 --> 01:37:32.199 align:start position:0%
he he had to cut his strength off his
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
hair you know um and we just don't feel
 
01:37:38.189 --> 01:37:38.199 align:start position:0%
like if that was anybody outside of the
 
01:37:40.270 --> 01:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
bipac community that that would have
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
happened and so this bill is like so
 
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
important this is real important to us
 
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
cuz I love my hair like with a passion
 
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
and and and my queen takes care care of
 
01:37:55.709 --> 01:37:55.719 align:start position:0%
my hair so um and I I can't see myself
 
01:37:57.910 --> 01:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
without locks you know um I'm actually
 
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
running to be a State Rep this year and
 
01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
I couldn't I I couldn't imagine them
 
01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
telling me in order to be a State Rep I
 
01:38:08.589 --> 01:38:08.599 align:start position:0%

01:38:24.189 --> 01:38:24.199 align:start position:0%
inhumane um um to to to discrimin
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
discriminate against someone for the
 
01:38:29.790 --> 01:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
style and texture of their hair and
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%

the town of Hollis and I'm here to

introduce hb1 1220 dfn this bill would
 
01:40:17.070 --> 01:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
remove the requirement for municipal
 
01:40:19.870 --> 01:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
clerks to requ request race and An
 
01:40:21.669 --> 01:40:21.679 align:start position:0%
ancestry information of couples wishing
 
01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
to be married in New
 
01:40:25.149 --> 01:40:25.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh before we get into the
 
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
details I'd like to lay out some of the
 
01:40:28.830 --> 01:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
context for how this bill came into
 
01:40:30.910 --> 01:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
being sponsors of this bill were
 
01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:34.639 align:start position:0%
contacted by assistant AG Shan lock um
 
01:40:36.189 --> 01:40:36.199 align:start position:0%
who is here and will speak in Greater
 
01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:38.719 align:start position:0%
detail about the history he indicated to
 
01:40:41.229 --> 01:40:41.239 align:start position:0%
us that in 2020 Governor sonunu voiced
 
01:40:43.470 --> 01:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
support for a bill that would remove
 
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
this requirement from marriage license
 
01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
applications the bill he referenced was
 
01:40:53.709 --> 01:40:53.719 align:start position:0%
HB 1644 from the 20 18 to 2020 session
 
01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
it sought to remove the collection of
 
01:40:56.910 --> 01:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
race data from marriage license
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
applications as well as other
 
01:40:58.639 --> 01:40:59.830 align:start position:0%
applications as well as other
governmental

01:40:59.830 --> 01:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
governmental
 
01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
forms that Bill had much more expansive
 
01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:04.159 align:start position:0%
reach and we're just talking about
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
marriage today and for the record the
 
01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
statute in question for hb1 1220 is RSA
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
5c section 41 paragraph 3 with RSA 5c
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
being the chapter um of the rsas on
 
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
Vital Records
 
01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
so there there are several reasons that
 
01:41:25.709 --> 01:41:25.719 align:start position:0%
support removing this data collection
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
requirement in marriage license
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
applications uh first this requirement
 
01:41:32.270 --> 01:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
has what I believe to be a chilling
 
01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:34.719 align:start position:0%
effect on joining the institution of
 
01:41:38.149 --> 01:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
marriage and uh prer perhaps for those
 
01:41:40.270 --> 01:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
families that are many generations
 
01:41:43.790 --> 01:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
removed from their immigrant ancestors
 
01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:46.360 align:start position:0%
sharing race and ancestral information
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
may not appear to be a strong reason to
 
01:41:51.950 --> 01:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
not apply for a marriage license
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
um but for those Americans that either
 
01:41:56.109 --> 01:41:56.119 align:start position:0%
know their immigrant family members or
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
are um immigrants themselves this is not
 
01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
a completely in inconsequential
 
01:42:04.430 --> 01:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
question and recent efforts in other
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
states to remove these types of data
 
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
retention policies on these grounds have
 
01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:09.070 align:start position:0%
retention policies on these grounds have
been

01:42:09.070 --> 01:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:42:11.470 --> 01:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
successful um again attorney lock should
 
01:42:13.229 --> 01:42:13.239 align:start position:0%
be able to go into greater detail on
 
01:42:13.239 --> 01:42:14.350 align:start position:0%
be able to go into greater detail on
that

01:42:14.350 --> 01:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
point uh secondly the data being
 
01:42:17.790 --> 01:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
collected is
 
01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
ineffective it's incomplete and not
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
necessar not necessarily representative
 
01:42:26.430 --> 01:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
of current reality and as a related
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
matter um race data is collected by the
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
national census so this data is sitting
 
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
around with no real purpose which brings
 
01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
me to my third point and that's the fact
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
that we must be cautious with the type
 
01:42:40.350 --> 01:42:40.360 align:start position:0%
of data our state government collects
 
01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
and holds uh I think the importance of
 
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
data privacy is becoming more and more
 
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
common knowledge and even incomplete and
 
01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
unorganized data can be mined for not so
 
01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:51.910 align:start position:0%
unorganized data can be mined for not so
innocuous

01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
innocuous
 
01:42:54.109 --> 01:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
purposes so I thank you for your time
 
01:42:54.119 --> 01:42:55.070 align:start position:0%
purposes so I thank you for your time
and

01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
consideration um I request that the
 
01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
committee give a recommendation of ought
 
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
to pass and be happy to answer any
 
01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this witness
 
01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you thanks
 
01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I have to ask why
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
problem um I'll first say that I was
 
01:43:18.430 --> 01:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
approached or the sponsors were
 
01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
approached by um assist an attorney
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
general lock to put this bill forward he
 
01:43:26.189 --> 01:43:26.199 align:start position:0%
had the language ready to go and he
 
01:43:28.709 --> 01:43:28.719 align:start position:0%
identified it as being an issue that
 
01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
could be a problem in our state because
 
01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
um like I said earlier it's been an
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
issue in other states and there have
 
01:43:37.790 --> 01:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
been uh efforts to have that removed in
 
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
other states so this is kind of getting
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
ahead of the situation and and that's
 
01:43:44.229 --> 01:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding of it and it
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
what's what's also interesting is that
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
in this conversation
 
01:43:52.950 --> 01:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
is I don't I don't know if if any of the
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
sponsors have their marriage application
 
01:43:58.470 --> 01:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so we don't actually
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
have a whole lot of um upfront knowledge
 
01:44:03.870 --> 01:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
like my marriage license is from
 
01:44:06.030 --> 01:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so I I had it's not
 
01:44:07.550 --> 01:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
something that I I don't think any of
 
01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
the sponsors had had real life knowledge
 
01:44:12.990 --> 01:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
of but I I could certainly see why C
 
01:44:14.709 --> 01:44:14.719 align:start position:0%
certain people would feel this
 
01:44:14.719 --> 01:44:16.910 align:start position:0%
certain people would feel this
way

01:44:16.910 --> 01:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
yes do you know if it is required
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
on the marriage certificate to state
 
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
that or can you leave it blank and I
 
01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.270 align:start position:0%
that or can you leave it blank and I
asked

01:44:28.270 --> 01:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
asked
 
01:44:31.390 --> 01:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
because my parents came here from Italy
 
01:44:34.270 --> 01:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't say I'm
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
Italian you know I I'm a white American
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
so do you is it required that you fill
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
that out on your marriage
 
01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
yes other
 
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative trip thank you for
 
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I suspect that
 
01:44:59.149 --> 01:44:59.159 align:start position:0%
maybe this will be answered later but uh
 
01:45:00.430 --> 01:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:45:04.270 --> 01:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
know uh what
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
this uh race and anesty information is
 
01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
used for or is it just collected and
 
01:45:13.629 --> 01:45:13.639 align:start position:0%
sits in the
 
01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
drawer I think it's um your your second
 
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
point it's and and that's kind of why it
 
01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
needs to it needs to be taken care of um
 
01:45:27.550 --> 01:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
I I personally my my final Point um on
 
01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
Dat of retention if it's not being used
 
01:45:32.669 --> 01:45:32.679 align:start position:0%
somewhere it really shouldn't be
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
collected thank you yeah other questions
 
01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
for this witness representative Staples
 
01:45:40.990 --> 01:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you or the uh
 
01:45:46.510 --> 01:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General or um any
 
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
other research show that there were
 
01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
problems of license denial um due to Ras
 
01:45:53.679 --> 01:45:54.790 align:start position:0%
problems of license denial um due to Ras
and

01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
ancestry um thank you for that question
 
01:46:00.350 --> 01:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if there's any
 
01:46:04.350 --> 01:46:04.360 align:start position:0%
data but I think the success
 
01:46:07.709 --> 01:46:07.719 align:start position:0%
of the the push to get rid of this
 
01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
requirement in other states kind of
 
01:46:11.870 --> 01:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
indicates that there is a
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
problem um and I think AG lock or
 
01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
assistant AG lock will be able to go
 
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
into that in Greater detail thank you
 
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness seeing
 
01:46:26.430 --> 01:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much representative
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to call on Representative
 
01:46:42.910 --> 01:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
please it's still good morning uh
 
01:46:46.990 --> 01:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
committee members this is my second time
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
this morning testifying it's a pleasure
 
01:46:50.790 --> 01:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
to be here uh thank you for hearing my
 
01:46:52.550 --> 01:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
testimony I I am a co-sponsor on this
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
Bill I'm here to lend my support uh to
 
01:46:57.709 --> 01:46:57.719 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:47:02.669 --> 01:47:02.679 align:start position:0%
um I think it goes towards the idea that
 
01:47:06.350 --> 01:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
we strive to be a colorblind society and
 
01:47:07.950 --> 01:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
that you know we see each other as
 
01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
individuals not of members of a group
 
01:47:13.550 --> 01:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
and that that is the the basis of my
 
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
support for this that I think it's it's
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
maybe an obsolete data point that we're
 
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
collecting um many people like to use uh
 
01:47:27.149 --> 01:47:27.159 align:start position:0%
ancestry.com to uh track their ancestral
 
01:47:29.629 --> 01:47:29.639 align:start position:0%
Roots um we have immigration records
 
01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
that track where your ancestors Came
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
From Italy or Germany or some other
 
01:47:38.109 --> 01:47:38.119 align:start position:0%
place um and so that data is is readily
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
available and tracked in large systems
 
01:47:44.669 --> 01:47:44.679 align:start position:0%
like with ancestry.com so I I see this
 
01:47:46.189 --> 01:47:46.199 align:start position:0%
data point as
 
01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
superflous and uh I think I support uh
 
01:47:51.310 --> 01:47:51.320 align:start position:0%
remove moving it simplifying the
 
01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:52.550 align:start position:0%
remove moving it simplifying the
marriage

01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
marriage
 
01:47:55.149 --> 01:47:55.159 align:start position:0%
license and happy to take any
 
01:47:58.589 --> 01:47:58.599 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this witness see
 
01:48:01.629 --> 01:48:01.639 align:start position:0%
representative gon thank you Mr it just
 
01:48:03.550 --> 01:48:03.560 align:start position:0%
occurred to me to ask a question about
 
01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
this the immediately following the uh
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
the race and
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
ancestry question is their level of
 
01:48:15.430 --> 01:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
Education what would be the purpose in
 
01:48:16.870 --> 01:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
collecting that data as well you talking
 
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
about Superfluous information what's the
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
reason for collecting their level of
 
01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
Education as well yeah so the the bill
 
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't touch on that point um but I I
 
01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
share your question I don't know why
 
01:48:30.229 --> 01:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
that's uh collected either um maybe to
 
01:48:31.310 --> 01:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
01:48:33.390 --> 01:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
that I I don't know what the what the
 
01:48:35.550 --> 01:48:35.560 align:start position:0%
reasoning was behind it I I won't even
 
01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
guess representative trip thank you
 
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh since you brought up
 
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
ancestry.com uh I I find that
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
interesting interesting because uh I've
 
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
never done it but my kids have and they
 
01:48:58.189 --> 01:48:58.199 align:start position:0%
found out that they're uh
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh their ancestry is uh from multiple
 
01:49:06.310 --> 01:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
places multiple being probably about
 
01:49:09.390 --> 01:49:09.400 align:start position:0%
20 uh I don't know how the marriage
 
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
license works but uh is there just a
 
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
checklist of uh things you can put
 
01:49:21.189 --> 01:49:21.199 align:start position:0%
down um the right behind me can answer
 
01:49:22.510 --> 01:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
that question a little better there may
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
be a checkbox with a a line that you can
 
01:49:26.750 --> 01:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
fill in for other I don't know the
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
answer I guess the the other question I
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
would ask is there is there a penalty
 
01:49:33.669 --> 01:49:33.679 align:start position:0%
for falsifying that I doubt it that
 
01:49:36.709 --> 01:49:36.719 align:start position:0%
there is but again I'll defer to experts
 
01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
behind me so this is kind of like your
 
01:49:40.669 --> 01:49:40.679 align:start position:0%
Facebook birthday everybody knows it's a
 
01:49:44.589 --> 01:49:44.599 align:start position:0%
lie but uh oh I I don't use Facebook
 
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
so smart
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
man questions for this
 
01:49:49.119 --> 01:49:50.709 align:start position:0%
man questions for this
sness

01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
sness

01:49:54.750 --> 01:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
representative next I'm going to call on
 
01:50:11.830 --> 01:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
please good morning everyone chairman
 
01:50:15.870 --> 01:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
Lynn members of the House Judiciary
 
01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
Committee my name is Sean Lock I'm a
 
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
senior Assistant Attorney General and I
 
01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
direct the Civil Rights unit at the new
 
01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:22.719 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office I am here on
 
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
behalf of the Attorney General to
 
01:50:25.870 --> 01:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
testify in support of House Bill 1220
 
01:50:28.189 --> 01:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
which is a bill that we requested I'm
 
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
going to kind of have three things I
 
01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
want to cover in this testimony first
 
01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
the background of how did this request
 
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
came to pass history of this particular
 
01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
provision uh RSA 5 c41 and then the
 
01:50:40.669 --> 01:50:40.679 align:start position:0%
legal issues that have Arisen I know
 
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
there have been questions asked I will
 
01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
do my best to answer those questions as
 
01:50:47.550 --> 01:50:47.560 align:start position:0%
well uh so starting with the history in
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
February of 2020 governor sununu and
 
01:50:51.149 --> 01:50:51.159 align:start position:0%
attorney General McDonald had received
 
01:50:54.030 --> 01:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
notice from Advocates that RSA 5 c41
 
01:50:55.629 --> 01:50:55.639 align:start position:0%
requires people seeking a marriage
 
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
license to provide information about
 
01:50:59.669 --> 01:50:59.679 align:start position:0%
their race and ancestry and that such
 
01:51:02.350 --> 01:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
requirements across the country are a
 
01:51:04.069 --> 01:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
vestage of laws that were designed to
 
01:51:06.109 --> 01:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
prohibit interracial marriages or to
 
01:51:09.069 --> 01:51:09.079 align:start position:0%
limit interracial marriages that some
 
01:51:12.390 --> 01:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
courts have had deemed constitutionally
 
01:51:14.270 --> 01:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
suspect that those requirements remain
 
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:51:19.229 --> 01:51:19.239 align:start position:0%
law uh I worked with then Governor's
 
01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
legal council John forel reviewed this
 
01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
and we consulted and agreed that the
 
01:51:23.790 --> 01:51:23.800 align:start position:0%
best course of action would be to remove
 
01:51:25.229 --> 01:51:25.239 align:start position:0%
the requirements which led to Governor
 
01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
cunu requesting of then speaker
 
01:51:30.589 --> 01:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
shirtliff and president Susi to use
 
01:51:32.990 --> 01:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1644 as a vehicle to enact
 
01:51:35.310 --> 01:51:35.320 align:start position:0%
those changes unfortunately that
 
01:51:37.550 --> 01:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
occurred on March 9th and about less
 
01:51:39.910 --> 01:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
than 10 days later the covid-19 pandemic
 
01:51:42.350 --> 01:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
began the state of emergency began and
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
along with many other pieces of
 
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
legislation that that did not go
 
01:51:49.069 --> 01:51:49.079 align:start position:0%
forward in April of 2023 we were
 
01:51:51.589 --> 01:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
contacted again by these Advocates about
 
01:51:52.830 --> 01:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
these changes and realizing that they
 
01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
had not they had been lost in Thea chaos
 
01:51:56.990 --> 01:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
of covid we offered to pursue a fix for
 
01:51:59.350 --> 01:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
this issue this afforded me time to do
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
the research and ensure that we were not
 
01:52:03.069 --> 01:52:03.079 align:start position:0%
creating there were no conflicting
 
01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
issues with respect to this data that's
 
01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
being collected so the history of this
 
01:52:12.750 --> 01:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
language is it first appears in 1858 it
 
01:52:14.510 --> 01:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
was first codified in
 
01:52:18.189 --> 01:52:18.199 align:start position:0%
1858 uh shortly after the requirement
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
for receiving a marriage certificate or
 
01:52:21.870 --> 01:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
marriage license shifted from a
 
01:52:23.709 --> 01:52:23.719 align:start position:0%
requirement that individuals have to
 
01:52:25.870 --> 01:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
publish in local papers their request
 
01:52:27.310 --> 01:52:27.320 align:start position:0%
that the idea that they are seeking to
 
01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
be married and provide opportunity for
 
01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
members of the public to object to the
 
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
marriage in 1854 was changed where you
 
01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
go to the town clerk's office and get
 
01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
something similar to the process as it
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
exists today four years later the
 
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
requirement that people provide their
 
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
color or ancestry data uh was in
 
01:52:45.629 --> 01:52:45.639 align:start position:0%
codified into the statute and the
 
01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
legislative record at that time you know
 
01:52:49.350 --> 01:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
we I certainly couldn't find access to
 
01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
it to see what was said other than the
 
01:52:53.069 --> 01:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
house Jour House of senent journals
 
01:52:54.870 --> 01:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
which did not provide a lot of
 
01:52:57.390 --> 01:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
information but the political current at
 
01:53:00.589 --> 01:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
the time in New England was dominated by
 
01:53:02.069 --> 01:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
what was called the no- Nothing party
 
01:53:03.390 --> 01:53:03.400 align:start position:0%
which was an anti-catholic
 
01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:04.910 align:start position:0%
which was an anti-catholic
anti-immigrant

01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
anti-immigrant
 
01:53:08.189 --> 01:53:08.199 align:start position:0%
um party and so certainly there it
 
01:53:10.030 --> 01:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
certainly creates a cloud as to why this
 
01:53:11.629 --> 01:53:11.639 align:start position:0%
requirement suddenly came into law when
 
01:53:14.270 --> 01:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
it hadn't been when we shifted from a
 
01:53:15.870 --> 01:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
published notification to the town
 
01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:18.069 align:start position:0%
published notification to the town
clerk's

01:53:18.069 --> 01:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
clerk's
 
01:53:21.390 --> 01:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
office over the years and decades this
 
01:53:22.589 --> 01:53:22.599 align:start position:0%
law had been shifted around and
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:30.390 --> 01:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
c41 in preparing this legislation um and
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
making this request I did consult with
 
01:53:33.589 --> 01:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
the division of Vital Records as well as
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
01:53:36.510 --> 01:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
Services to learn if it had any mo there
 
01:53:38.910 --> 01:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
there's any modern reason any modern use
 
01:53:41.310 --> 01:53:41.320 align:start position:0%
for this particular data and it was
 
01:53:42.430 --> 01:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
informed by the division of Vital
 
01:53:44.350 --> 01:53:44.360 align:start position:0%
Records that although they collect this
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
data you the federal government decades
 
01:53:48.790 --> 01:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
ago used to collect this data it has not
 
01:53:51.669 --> 01:53:51.679 align:start position:0%
since the 199 90 s um so essentially
 
01:53:52.990 --> 01:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
what this data does it's it's
 
01:53:54.550 --> 01:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
statistical data that's kept it's
 
01:53:56.069 --> 01:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
accessible to the public but that's its
 
01:53:59.310 --> 01:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
only use it's not used for any sort of
 
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
um other
 
01:54:03.669 --> 01:54:03.679 align:start position:0%
purpose which brings me to kind of the
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
legal questions here so where these
 
01:54:07.470 --> 01:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
requirements have been challenged in
 
01:54:09.430 --> 01:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
courts it's implicated both the equal
 
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
protection Clause as well as the
 
01:54:12.830 --> 01:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
fundamental right to marriage which has
 
01:54:14.750 --> 01:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
been recognized by multiple courts or
 
01:54:16.069 --> 01:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
the US Supreme Court multiple times
 
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
going back to the decision in loving
 
01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:18.669 align:start position:0%
going back to the decision in loving
View

01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
View
 
01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
Virginia it warrants strict scrutiny
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
which means that there needs to be a
 
01:54:24.750 --> 01:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
compelling State interest for for
 
01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
requiring the provision of this data in
 
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
order to receive a marriage
 
01:54:31.069 --> 01:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
license unlike states where this has
 
01:54:33.870 --> 01:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
been challenged where there is a much
 
01:54:36.430 --> 01:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
stronger link between the concepts of
 
01:54:38.069 --> 01:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
racial Integrity or prohibiting
 
01:54:38.079 --> 01:54:39.390 align:start position:0%
racial Integrity or prohibiting
interracial

01:54:39.390 --> 01:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
interracial
 
01:54:41.470 --> 01:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
marriage and these this these
 
01:54:42.550 --> 01:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
requirements that is not necess
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
president in New Hampshire New Hampshire
 
01:54:44.790 --> 01:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
never had a law that prohibited
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
interracial marriage and and so that
 
01:54:51.149 --> 01:54:51.159 align:start position:0%
link isn't as clearly cut but it still
 
01:54:54.069 --> 01:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
distills down to even absent that link
 
01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
the state interest may be limited
 
01:54:57.229 --> 01:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
because all this data is collected for
 
01:54:58.870 --> 01:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
it to simply be available for the public
 
01:55:00.910 --> 01:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
to look up on the division of Vital
 
01:55:03.390 --> 01:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
Records website it's not information
 
01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
that's used for health information
 
01:55:08.430 --> 01:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
Health kind of Distributing resources or
 
01:55:10.750 --> 01:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
for any other state purpose that I am
 
01:55:12.990 --> 01:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
aware of and so that is why you know and
 
01:55:15.550 --> 01:55:15.560 align:start position:0%
I contacted the sponsors for this bill
 
01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
um asking them to introduce it because
 
01:55:18.589 --> 01:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
last year they had been the sponsors on
 
01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
a bill that codified the loving standard
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
that that prohib that recognizes in
 
01:55:24.669 --> 01:55:24.679 align:start position:0%
state law the right to interracial
 
01:55:26.350 --> 01:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
marriage so I thought they would be a
 
01:55:28.189 --> 01:55:28.199 align:start position:0%
good vehicle to start this conversation
 
01:55:29.709 --> 01:55:29.719 align:start position:0%
having done that work in the previous
 
01:55:31.750 --> 01:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
year but the Attorney General kind of
 
01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:33.679 align:start position:0%
with that background asked that this
 
01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
committee abandon this remnant of kind
 
01:55:39.069 --> 01:55:39.079 align:start position:0%
of a a a previous time and vote ought to
 
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
pass on House Bill 1220 and I'm happy to
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
take any questions and I was just to the
 
01:55:44.750 --> 01:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
most recent question pulling up the
 
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
worksheet for how this data gets
 
01:55:49.109 --> 01:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
reported as part of the the licensing
 
01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
requirement here so I can hopefully
 
01:55:54.030 --> 01:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
answer some questions about that as well
 
01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:04.229 --> 01:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
K thank you chairman and thank you for
 
01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question just for the record
 
01:56:09.589 --> 01:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
purposes when you had initially talked
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
about the bill and the pandemic you had
 
01:56:13.310 --> 01:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
referenced February 2021 did you mean
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
February of 2020 yes that's what I meant
 
01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
sorry thank
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
you so can can I ask I don't see any
 
01:56:20.589 --> 01:56:20.599 align:start position:0%
other question can I question what would
 
01:56:22.390 --> 01:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
you say I mean it seemed that
 
01:56:26.109 --> 01:56:26.119 align:start position:0%
representative uh Ammon had a good
 
01:56:29.149 --> 01:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
point just as race and ancestry would
 
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
seem to me to have nothing to do with
 
01:56:33.790 --> 01:56:33.800 align:start position:0%
you know the state would seem to have no
 
01:56:35.950 --> 01:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
interest for marriage purposes and
 
01:56:38.069 --> 01:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
knowing that what about level of
 
01:56:39.470 --> 01:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
Education why would they have any
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
interest in that for marriage purposes I
 
01:56:43.390 --> 01:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
would share the concern I didn't neily
 
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
the inquiry that how it came to us was
 
01:56:46.550 --> 01:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
about the race and ancestry data so I
 
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
didn't ask about the education
 
01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
requirement but I would share that same
 
01:56:50.790 --> 01:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
concern con ER and when representative
 
01:56:52.629 --> 01:56:52.639 align:start position:0%
Aon brought it up I also shared the
 
01:56:54.430 --> 01:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
concern but wanted to at least keep the
 
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
bill for now clean and neat to the
 
01:56:58.390 --> 01:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
specific issues that were presented to
 
01:57:00.990 --> 01:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
us um but I I don't you know I I don't
 
01:57:02.430 --> 01:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
know that there is a reason we were to
 
01:57:05.629 --> 01:57:05.639 align:start position:0%
do an amendment to that also there would
 
01:57:07.550 --> 01:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
be no problem as far as you could see
 
01:57:11.109 --> 01:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
right all right representative Perez
 
01:57:12.510 --> 01:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my question
 
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
lots of questions s
 
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
sorry having been a health professional
 
01:57:20.470 --> 01:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
for 42 years I think my ANC IND is
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
extremely important um um I think years
 
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
down the road um I mean I happen to know
 
01:57:33.229 --> 01:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
where my parents came from in Italy but
 
01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
years down if that is not public record
 
01:57:40.149 --> 01:57:40.159 align:start position:0%
through a marriage certificate or
 
01:57:44.669 --> 01:57:44.679 align:start position:0%
nowhere people may not know um there are
 
01:57:47.830 --> 01:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
certain no matter what I eat I have a
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
fabulous HDL I'm called an olive oil
 
01:57:54.589 --> 01:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
Italian I only know that from my
 
01:57:57.709 --> 01:57:57.719 align:start position:0%
ancestry that's very important and I'm
 
01:58:01.709 --> 01:58:01.719 align:start position:0%
in a study now because of that um I just
 
01:58:05.470 --> 01:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
don't see if we don't have a
 
01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
problem here in New Hampshire where it
 
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
has never been a
 
01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
problem why to pick and choose to
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
eliminate this when that
 
01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
information may be necessary for a
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
you know something a catastrophic
 
01:58:25.270 --> 01:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
illness that has come about down the
 
01:58:28.750 --> 01:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
road so I guess I'm not con it's the you
 
01:58:32.030 --> 01:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
know if it ain't broke don't fix it you
 
01:58:34.589 --> 01:58:34.599 align:start position:0%
say we do not discriminate we never have
 
01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
discriminated in the state of New
 
01:58:36.719 --> 01:58:38.350 align:start position:0%
discriminated in the state of New
Hampshire

01:58:38.350 --> 01:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
um what do you say to Generations down
 
01:58:44.510 --> 01:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
the road who want to know the ancestry
 
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
of their great great grandparents well
 
01:58:48.470 --> 01:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
tough we didn't ask for it anymore well
 
01:58:50.149 --> 01:58:50.159 align:start position:0%
so I think there's several answers to
 
01:58:52.430 --> 01:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
that question the first is even though
 
01:58:54.270 --> 01:58:54.280 align:start position:0%
there was no codification of a
 
01:58:55.629 --> 01:58:55.639 align:start position:0%
Prohibition on interracial marriage it
 
01:58:56.830 --> 01:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that this requirement
 
01:58:58.870 --> 01:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that same taint or Paul
 
01:59:00.910 --> 01:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
kind of over it and you know you still
 
01:59:02.430 --> 01:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
have to go to the town clerk and present
 
01:59:05.069 --> 01:59:05.079 align:start position:0%
this data and it could lead to again I I
 
01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not that much of a
 
01:59:08.069 --> 01:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
historian to know what happened in the
 
01:59:10.470 --> 01:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
1850s and 60s but doesn't mean that
 
01:59:12.270 --> 01:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
people historically weren't refused
 
01:59:14.229 --> 01:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
licenses because they came or it didn't
 
01:59:16.910 --> 01:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
create problems going forward that it I
 
01:59:18.270 --> 01:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
you know I don't imagine it's a problem
 
01:59:19.950 --> 01:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
in the present day in the same way it
 
01:59:22.589 --> 01:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
may have been historically but to the
 
01:59:24.750 --> 01:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
the point about using this as a a tool
 
01:59:27.390 --> 01:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
to track your own race and ancestry data
 
01:59:28.910 --> 01:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
you still have to provide information
 
01:59:30.629 --> 01:59:30.639 align:start position:0%
about your F your family history so you
 
01:59:32.030 --> 01:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
have to provide information about who
 
01:59:35.390 --> 01:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
your parents were um and both both
 
01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
individuals getting married and so that
 
01:59:38.189 --> 01:59:38.199 align:start position:0%
information is still something that can
 
01:59:40.149 --> 01:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
be used to trace the information back if
 
01:59:42.189 --> 01:59:42.199 align:start position:0%
you're trying to identify where your
 
01:59:44.229 --> 01:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
ancestors may have come to how they
 
01:59:45.950 --> 01:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
originally came to the United States
 
01:59:47.790 --> 01:59:47.800 align:start position:0%
where they came from you could use that
 
01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
information that knowledge just like
 
01:59:51.149 --> 01:59:51.159 align:start position:0%
anyone would you know I know my parents'
 
01:59:52.870 --> 01:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
names I can go look for their birth
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%
records figure out who their parents
 
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
were and that's usually how the the
 
01:59:58.069 --> 01:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
genealogy process works um it's not
 
02:00:00.390 --> 02:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily you know I could put and I
 
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
in the worksheet itself it just asks for
 
02:00:04.350 --> 02:00:04.360 align:start position:0%
a ra it's a fill in it's a a person can
 
02:00:06.189 --> 02:00:06.199 align:start position:0%
fill in you know it's not a checkbox
 
02:00:07.870 --> 02:00:07.880 align:start position:0%
it's a put what how you would
 
02:00:10.149 --> 02:00:10.159 align:start position:0%
self-describe your race or ancestry but
 
02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
I couldn't go look up your marriage
 
02:00:15.510 --> 02:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
license in a public record somewhere and
 
02:00:17.229 --> 02:00:17.239 align:start position:0%
find that information because it's the
 
02:00:18.669 --> 02:00:18.679 align:start position:0%
the worksheet itself is done it's
 
02:00:20.830 --> 02:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
collected by the clerk's office before
 
02:00:22.950 --> 02:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
they issue you the marriage license and
 
02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
then when the person is married it gets
 
02:00:26.310 --> 02:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
sent to vital records as and compiled
 
02:00:28.709 --> 02:00:28.719 align:start position:0%
into data that is publicly accessible
 
02:00:31.109 --> 02:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
but only in a statistical sense so it
 
02:00:34.510 --> 02:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
will say you know 1,000 people who
 
02:00:36.510 --> 02:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
identify as black you know received
 
02:00:38.270 --> 02:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
marriage licenses in this previous year
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's not to the point of this particular
 
02:00:44.189 --> 02:00:44.199 align:start position:0%
person identifies as this race and
 
02:00:45.790 --> 02:00:45.800 align:start position:0%
received a marriage license this year so
 
02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
it's doesn't for those research purposes
 
02:00:50.510 --> 02:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
it is isn't necessarily useful data in
 
02:00:53.229 --> 02:00:53.239 align:start position:0%
that regard as opposed to um birth
 
02:00:55.830 --> 02:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
records which would still still require
 
02:00:57.550 --> 02:00:57.560 align:start position:0%
provision of race data adoption records
 
02:00:59.430 --> 02:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
still require provision of race data and
 
02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
family familial data so there's still
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
other vital records that may collect
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
this data that was part of the issue in
 
02:01:07.350 --> 02:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1644 from what I recall and
 
02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
why um the governor when he in his
 
02:01:11.390 --> 02:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
letter asked for and I can provide a
 
02:01:14.669 --> 02:01:14.679 align:start position:0%
copy of the letter for the committee um
 
02:01:16.470 --> 02:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
to save this one piece with marriage
 
02:01:17.709 --> 02:01:17.719 align:start position:0%
licenses because there were concerns
 
02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
about other types of vital records birth
 
02:01:22.229 --> 02:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
records death records adoption records
 
02:01:24.030 --> 02:01:24.040 align:start position:0%
and the requirements under state and
 
02:01:26.709 --> 02:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
federal law to ensure that Vital Records
 
02:01:28.990 --> 02:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
isn't compliance with
 
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
those yes and I understand you can go
 
02:01:36.109 --> 02:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
back but when my mother came here her
 
02:01:37.709 --> 02:01:37.719 align:start position:0%
last name was changed because they wrote
 
02:01:40.470 --> 02:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
it wrong coming off the
 
02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:42.550 align:start position:0%
it wrong coming off the
boat

02:01:42.550 --> 02:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
boat
 
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
so tracing things is not as clean as you
 
02:01:50.189 --> 02:01:50.199 align:start position:0%
think it might be whereas if when she
 
02:01:53.109 --> 02:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
had to have her marriage license she
 
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
said her ancestry
 
02:01:58.270 --> 02:01:58.280 align:start position:0%
was you know a
 
02:02:01.910 --> 02:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
brutes you could trace it so I I
 
02:02:03.750 --> 02:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
understand in a perfect world that that
 
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
would work but names are dramatically
 
02:02:09.229 --> 02:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
have been changed and people can change
 
02:02:11.109 --> 02:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
their names and people can change their
 
02:02:13.510 --> 02:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
names to change
 
02:02:17.069 --> 02:02:17.079 align:start position:0%
their possible notif you of notifying
 
02:02:18.589 --> 02:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
take the I and the O off and I'm not
 
02:02:22.629 --> 02:02:22.639 align:start position:0%
aent anymore so um I just I understand
 
02:02:24.510 --> 02:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
where you're coming from but again I
 
02:02:27.950 --> 02:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
still just cannot see where this is in
 
02:02:30.390 --> 02:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
the best interests of future generations
 
02:02:32.069 --> 02:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
and I would just to quickly respond to
 
02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
that I appreciate that concern but I
 
02:02:36.069 --> 02:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
also re this is a question of whether or
 
02:02:37.990 --> 02:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
not it's of a compelling State interest
 
02:02:39.910 --> 02:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
to collect that data so there's a
 
02:02:41.910 --> 02:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
question of I want to do genealogical
 
02:02:44.510 --> 02:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
research versus you know why is the
 
02:02:46.709 --> 02:02:46.719 align:start position:0%
state collecting this data because I
 
02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
don't know that it's going to be a
 
02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
compelling justification to say so other
 
02:02:52.350 --> 02:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
people can so someone Generations in the
 
02:02:53.870 --> 02:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
line might be able to do Gene
 
02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:57.229 align:start position:0%
line might be able to do Gene
genealogical

02:02:57.229 --> 02:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:59.870 --> 02:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
research other questions for this
 
02:03:02.830 --> 02:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
witness representative Manos thank you
 
02:03:04.430 --> 02:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
02:03:07.510 --> 02:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
question is there a technical definition
 
02:03:11.350 --> 02:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
of An ancestry and if so what what is it
 
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh not in the statute let me see I will
 
02:03:16.870 --> 02:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
look at the worksheet and see what it so
 
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
for ancestry it does it it lists as
 
02:03:22.589 --> 02:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
examples English French Puerto Rican Etc
 
02:03:24.510 --> 02:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
and it's open to that person to specify
 
02:03:28.229 --> 02:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
is yeah so then there isn't even
 
02:03:34.149 --> 02:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily consistency between how
 
02:03:36.750 --> 02:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
similarly situated people W would answer
 
02:03:39.069 --> 02:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
the same question correct and that's
 
02:03:40.589 --> 02:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
something that was identified in the
 
02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
court that has most recently addressed
 
02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
this particular issue is that even where
 
02:03:46.149 --> 02:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
the data is collected it's not
 
02:03:48.109 --> 02:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
consistent so how reliable is this data
 
02:03:50.870 --> 02:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
if it has any purpose at
 
02:03:55.109 --> 02:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
all representative uh trip Mr chair
 
02:03:57.030 --> 02:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
question uh are there any other
 
02:04:04.350 --> 02:04:04.360 align:start position:0%
documents like uh birth certificates or
 
02:04:07.390 --> 02:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
whatever where race and an trusty uh
 
02:04:09.669 --> 02:04:09.679 align:start position:0%
information is collected yes so my
 
02:04:10.950 --> 02:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
understanding is birth
 
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
certificates um adoption records and
 
02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
death certificates do still collect race
 
02:04:16.870 --> 02:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
and an or at least race data I don't
 
02:04:18.350 --> 02:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
know about ancestry off the top of my
 
02:04:20.149 --> 02:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
head but those do and like I said that
 
02:04:23.549 --> 02:04:23.559 align:start position:0%
was part of the codification that was
 
02:04:24.709 --> 02:04:24.719 align:start position:0%
being prop or the changes that were
 
02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
being proposed in House Bill
 
02:04:29.189 --> 02:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
1644 and like I said with the I don't
 
02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
remember which exact set of Records
 
02:04:32.790 --> 02:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
became the problem but some of them
 
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
there was concerns raised by vital
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
records and the Health and Human
 
02:04:37.069 --> 02:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
Services about removing that because
 
02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
there are requirements under federal law
 
02:04:40.430 --> 02:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
to collect some of that information I
 
02:04:41.990 --> 02:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
know specifically with respect to
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
adoption records there are a lot of
 
02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
federal laws related to Native American
 
02:04:47.229 --> 02:04:47.239 align:start position:0%
Adoptions that if you were to remove
 
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
that requirement could create problems
 
02:04:52.069 --> 02:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
in conflict with um Federal the federal
 
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
law government's ability to kind of
 
02:04:55.350 --> 02:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
ensure that those laws are being
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
followed thank
 
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
you other questions for this witness
 
02:05:02.549 --> 02:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
02:05:05.350 --> 02:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
you all lot uh next I'm going to call on
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:19.870 --> 02:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
please good morning my name is Kristen
 
02:05:21.870 --> 02:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
kenniston I'm the state registar and
 
02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
director of Vital Records um so I'm
 
02:05:25.510 --> 02:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
hoping I'll be able to answer some of
 
02:05:27.030 --> 02:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
the questions for you that I've heard
 
02:05:29.629 --> 02:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
earlier what I have coming around right
 
02:05:32.470 --> 02:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
now is a handout and it has the marriage
 
02:05:34.430 --> 02:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
intention worksheets for you all to look
 
02:05:37.470 --> 02:05:37.480 align:start position:0%
at it also shows you a test sample of
 
02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
what a marriage license would look like
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's created after the couple has
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
filled out a marriage intention
 
02:05:45.589 --> 02:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
worksheet and then there is a certified
 
02:05:47.109 --> 02:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
copy for you to look at of what a
 
02:05:50.149 --> 02:05:50.159 align:start position:0%
marriage license looks like after so um
 
02:05:52.510 --> 02:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
we'll start with the marriage worksheets
 
02:05:55.109 --> 02:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
it's a two-page document on the back is
 
02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
where the statistical information is
 
02:05:59.830 --> 02:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
being collected so um as it's been
 
02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
pointed out already that the statistical
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
component as far as race and ancestry
 
02:06:09.350 --> 02:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
goes there's no check boxes it's it's
 
02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
all entirely self-reliant so it depends
 
02:06:16.189 --> 02:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
on what you want to put down um and then
 
02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
there's the educational piece which is
 
02:06:23.229 --> 02:06:23.239 align:start position:0%
um to standard education of um I can't
 
02:06:25.270 --> 02:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
even talk right now I'm sorry the United
 
02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
States education system so that it goes
 
02:06:31.149 --> 02:06:31.159 align:start position:0%
through college so when a couple gets
 
02:06:32.390 --> 02:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
married they need to go to the town
 
02:06:33.910 --> 02:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
clerk's office or the city clerk's
 
02:06:35.629 --> 02:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
office in the state of New Hampshire to
 
02:06:37.109 --> 02:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
apply for their marriage license they
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
bring with them their photo ID $50 and
 
02:06:42.030 --> 02:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
then they have to show some proof of
 
02:06:43.870 --> 02:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
that they're free to marry so either
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
they would bring their divorce decree
 
02:06:47.629 --> 02:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
with them or maybe a copy of a death
 
02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:49.679 align:start position:0%
certificate for a previous a spouse they
 
02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
fill out that information on the
 
02:06:53.589 --> 02:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
worksheet they sign it the clerk then
 
02:06:55.510 --> 02:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
goes to the computer and enters that
 
02:06:58.510 --> 02:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
marriage license into our neverin system
 
02:07:01.109 --> 02:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
so the neverin system is our electronic
 
02:07:02.830 --> 02:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
database that we use for all of our
 
02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:03.629 align:start position:0%
database that we use for all of our
Vital

02:07:03.629 --> 02:07:03.639 align:start position:0%
Vital
 
02:07:05.990 --> 02:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
Records the system will then generate
 
02:07:07.549 --> 02:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
off the marriage license which you'll
 
02:07:10.950 --> 02:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
see on page two of your handout and you
 
02:07:12.669 --> 02:07:12.679 align:start position:0%
can see if you look down at the very
 
02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
bottom of that that the statistical
 
02:07:16.990 --> 02:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
information does not appear anywhere on
 
02:07:19.109 --> 02:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
there so it never shows up anywhere on
 
02:07:21.629 --> 02:07:21.639 align:start position:0%
the marriage license at all and then
 
02:07:23.390 --> 02:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
when you get to the point after the um
 
02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
ceremony has been completed by the
 
02:07:28.270 --> 02:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
officient and it's signed off on and
 
02:07:30.270 --> 02:07:30.280 align:start position:0%
returned to the clerk they'll put that
 
02:07:31.950 --> 02:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
into our neverend system to finish it
 
02:07:33.870 --> 02:07:33.880 align:start position:0%
off it becomes a filed record and then
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
the couple can buy a certified copy of
 
02:07:38.030 --> 02:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
the record so the last page is just a
 
02:07:39.950 --> 02:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
sample of what shows up on a certified
 
02:07:41.390 --> 02:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
copy and again you'll see that the
 
02:07:43.109 --> 02:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
statistical information does not show
 
02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
anywhere on there so currently the
 
02:07:47.189 --> 02:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
reason that we are collecting the
 
02:07:49.229 --> 02:07:49.239 align:start position:0%
statistical information just to back up
 
02:07:50.549 --> 02:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony you've already
 
02:07:52.510 --> 02:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
heard from today is because it's a
 
02:07:56.030 --> 02:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
national standard so um somewhere in the
 
02:07:58.830 --> 02:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
1950s the marriage licenses started to
 
02:08:02.390 --> 02:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
be um looked at and a National Standard
 
02:08:04.030 --> 02:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
was set for that so it's twofold for
 
02:08:05.709 --> 02:08:05.719 align:start position:0%
that purposes one is from the record
 
02:08:08.470 --> 02:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
side of things where when you get
 
02:08:09.990 --> 02:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
married in one state you're collecting
 
02:08:11.709 --> 02:08:11.719 align:start position:0%
the same information so that if you took
 
02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:13.320 align:start position:0%
that marriage license to another state
 
02:08:14.709 --> 02:08:14.719 align:start position:0%
you can still conduct your business
 
02:08:16.470 --> 02:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
there they'll still accept it because
 
02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's a standard form it's still
 
02:08:20.030 --> 02:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
collecting all the same information that
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
other states are collecting from a
 
02:08:24.709 --> 02:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
statistical standpoint the information
 
02:08:26.750 --> 02:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
it needs to be obviously consistent
 
02:08:28.229 --> 02:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
whenever you're looking at Public Health
 
02:08:30.149 --> 02:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
you always want to look at the same data
 
02:08:32.709 --> 02:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
set um and it just helps with the data
 
02:08:36.069 --> 02:08:36.079 align:start position:0%
quality so that's a reason why it had to
 
02:08:37.870 --> 02:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
be consistent in all the other states so
 
02:08:39.189 --> 02:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of the other states are also
 
02:08:41.750 --> 02:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
collecting this data at this time as
 
02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
well I would say that the statistical
 
02:08:45.950 --> 02:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
data that's being collected though is
 
02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
not being used um we do not report any
 
02:08:50.510 --> 02:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
of this information to the federal
 
02:08:52.830 --> 02:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
government anymore they had a program
 
02:08:54.109 --> 02:08:54.119 align:start position:0%
that used to actually use the
 
02:08:55.750 --> 02:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
statistical information that ended in
 
02:08:58.790 --> 02:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
the 199s so I believe in 1995 was like
 
02:09:01.069 --> 02:09:01.079 align:start position:0%
the last time we actually give gave this
 
02:09:02.709 --> 02:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
information to the federal government
 
02:09:06.390 --> 02:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
for their use and also our New Hampshire
 
02:09:08.229 --> 02:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
no longer uses this information I did
 
02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
confirm that with them they don't touch
 
02:09:14.629 --> 02:09:14.639 align:start position:0%
any of the statistical piece so to Echo
 
02:09:16.149 --> 02:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
what you are hearing today this
 
02:09:18.470 --> 02:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
information is simply being collected
 
02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
and it's it's just collecting uh
 
02:09:23.549 --> 02:09:23.559 align:start position:0%
metaphorical dust in our database and
 
02:09:25.549 --> 02:09:25.559 align:start position:0%
there's no reason for us to collect it
 
02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
so just another component so you
 
02:09:29.870 --> 02:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
understand too we collect the data at
 
02:09:31.350 --> 02:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
Vital Records we actually don't use it
 
02:09:33.750 --> 02:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
we are not doing statistic work with it
 
02:09:35.669 --> 02:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
so we have no use for it federal
 
02:09:37.990 --> 02:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
government has no use for it and our New
 
02:09:39.310 --> 02:09:39.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Health and Human
 
02:09:41.270 --> 02:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
Services does not
 
02:09:43.830 --> 02:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
either um so just going back to the
 
02:09:46.750 --> 02:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
standardized forms so even though R RSA
 
02:09:48.990 --> 02:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
5 C5 says that we follow follow national
 
02:09:50.709 --> 02:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
standards on all of our records the
 
02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
national standards for our Vital Records
 
02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
for marriage licenses hasn't been
 
02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:56.069 align:start position:0%
for marriage licenses hasn't been
updated

02:09:56.069 --> 02:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
updated
 
02:09:59.750 --> 02:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
since 1989 so we are still following
 
02:10:02.510 --> 02:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
these old guidelines um that we don't
 
02:10:06.390 --> 02:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
really need to anymore RSA 5c4 says that
 
02:10:08.270 --> 02:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be collecting any data that
 
02:10:11.629 --> 02:10:11.639 align:start position:0%
we really don't need so I am not opposed
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
to this coming out if if you'd see fit
 
02:10:16.589 --> 02:10:16.599 align:start position:0%
in removing it I would actually even go
 
02:10:18.750 --> 02:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
one step further and ask that you do
 
02:10:20.510 --> 02:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
also remove the educational piece
 
02:10:21.629 --> 02:10:21.639 align:start position:0%
because that's sitting there and we're
 
02:10:23.549 --> 02:10:23.559 align:start position:0%
not doing anything with it either to
 
02:10:24.910 --> 02:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
answer a question that was brought up
 
02:10:27.510 --> 02:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
earlier about education at one time
 
02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
occupation used to be um something that
 
02:10:31.149 --> 02:10:31.159 align:start position:0%
they sought and then somewhere along the
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
line the federal government realized
 
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
that wasn't a really great indicator of
 
02:10:36.390 --> 02:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic backgrounds so they did
 
02:10:38.589 --> 02:10:38.599 align:start position:0%
change that piece to being education
 
02:10:39.709 --> 02:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
because they thought that that was a
 
02:10:41.229 --> 02:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
better way of actually being able to
 
02:10:44.189 --> 02:10:44.199 align:start position:0%
interpret that data so that's why that's
 
02:10:47.229 --> 02:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
on there but again it's not being
 
02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
used right um the only other final thing
 
02:10:53.470 --> 02:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
that I would say is fiscal impacts
 
02:10:56.109 --> 02:10:56.119 align:start position:0%
relatively small I think we said $10,000
 
02:10:57.589 --> 02:10:57.599 align:start position:0%
in working with our software company on
 
02:10:58.830 --> 02:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
some other things I might put that
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
closer to 20,000 but still not a huge
 
02:11:03.270 --> 02:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact we'd have to redo our
 
02:11:06.750 --> 02:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
forms which again aren't a big deal um
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
and the 60 days though for I think it
 
02:11:10.990 --> 02:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
was an effective date of 60 days I might
 
02:11:12.750 --> 02:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
respectfully request that's 90 just to
 
02:11:14.430 --> 02:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
give us a little extra time to get our
 
02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
forms changed and to make our software
 
02:11:19.310 --> 02:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
changes should you choose to pass this
 
02:11:20.990 --> 02:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
and I can take any questions questions
 
02:11:22.910 --> 02:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
for this
 
02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:25.350 align:start position:0%
for this
witness

02:11:25.350 --> 02:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
witness
 
02:11:27.109 --> 02:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:11:28.990 --> 02:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question would
 
02:11:31.589 --> 02:11:31.599 align:start position:0%
you mind repeating which uh statue you
 
02:11:34.270 --> 02:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
stated um states that you shouldn't be
 
02:11:35.350 --> 02:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
collecting information if you aren't
 
02:11:37.790 --> 02:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
going to be using it RSA 5c4 and that
 
02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
was my loose interpretation of that I
 
02:11:41.109 --> 02:11:41.119 align:start position:0%
have it here if you want me to pass it
 
02:11:42.430 --> 02:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
over need to look at okay that's okay
 
02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:44.390 align:start position:0%
over need to look at okay that's okay
thank

02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:11:47.709 --> 02:11:47.719 align:start position:0%
you other questions for this witness
 
02:11:56.629 --> 02:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:00.549 --> 02:12:00.559 align:start position:0%
much just making a note on
 
02:12:04.109 --> 02:12:04.119 align:start position:0%
something all right um I don't have any
 
02:12:06.549 --> 02:12:06.559 align:start position:0%
other uh Pink cards is there anyone else
 
02:12:13.669 --> 02:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:16.830 --> 02:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
2020 I should note uh for the record
 
02:12:18.750 --> 02:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
that there were four people uh
 
02:12:21.669 --> 02:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill three people
 
02:12:25.470 --> 02:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
opposed um and that's it I don't U see
 
02:12:26.830 --> 02:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else so I'm going to close the
 
02:12:30.910 --> 02:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on uh House Bill
 
02:12:35.390 --> 02:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
2020 and um what time is
 
02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
it we have three minutes for the next
 
02:12:42.069 --> 02:12:42.079 align:start position:0%

pleased to bring this bill before you
 
02:17:13.230 --> 02:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
again uh as all of you who are not new
 
02:17:16.349 --> 02:17:16.359 align:start position:0%
to this committee this year know this
 
02:17:21.509 --> 02:17:21.519 align:start position:0%
bill was for you um last term uh last
 
02:17:26.070 --> 02:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
year and uh it was amended uh at at our
 
02:17:29.910 --> 02:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
request as well uh and so the bill as
 
02:17:33.790 --> 02:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
I'm bringing it to you uh is the amended
 
02:17:37.270 --> 02:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
version since we are we were totally on
 
02:17:40.230 --> 02:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
board with the uh with the amendment
 
02:17:44.190 --> 02:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
that is that is Incorporated in was
 
02:17:46.830 --> 02:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
incorporated in the bill last year so
 
02:17:49.150 --> 02:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
can I just add can I just ask just uh I
 
02:17:50.709 --> 02:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
don't mean to interrupt your represent
 
02:17:53.349 --> 02:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
but is this is is the
 
02:17:56.910 --> 02:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
1245 that we have before us now it is
 
02:18:00.389 --> 02:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
the same bill as amended that was that
 
02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
this committee passed and then the Full
 
02:18:04.629 --> 02:18:04.639 align:start position:0%
House passed last year that is my
 
02:18:07.629 --> 02:18:07.639 align:start position:0%
understanding Mr chairman because we
 
02:18:10.230 --> 02:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
were totally on board with the idea of
 
02:18:14.429 --> 02:18:14.439 align:start position:0%
the amendment we we we endorsed it fully
 
02:18:16.549 --> 02:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
um and I said there's no sense going
 
02:18:19.389 --> 02:18:19.399 align:start position:0%
back to the original Bill and and having
 
02:18:21.469 --> 02:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
you have to amend it all over again that
 
02:18:23.709 --> 02:18:23.719 align:start position:0%
made no sense um
 
02:18:28.190 --> 02:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
so I am but I have uh several uh people
 
02:18:30.309 --> 02:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
here who are extremely knowledgeable
 
02:18:32.750 --> 02:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
about this issue and they will be
 
02:18:32.760 --> 02:18:34.309 align:start position:0%
about this issue and they will be
testifying

02:18:34.309 --> 02:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
02:18:38.150 --> 02:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
momentarily um but
 
02:18:41.150 --> 02:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh this may seem like a small bill but
 
02:18:43.950 --> 02:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
to the people uh in this in this
 
02:18:48.309 --> 02:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
category this is a very important issue
 
02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
um and I appreciate the hard work that
 
02:18:52.429 --> 02:18:52.439 align:start position:0%
the committee did last year on getting
 
02:18:56.469 --> 02:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
it to this point um and uh so I'm not
 
02:18:58.429 --> 02:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
going to take questions on the subject
 
02:19:00.709 --> 02:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
because the attorneys and so forth who
 
02:19:04.349 --> 02:19:04.359 align:start position:0%
are here and uh to to present the facts
 
02:19:06.830 --> 02:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
and and discuss the issue with you they
 
02:19:09.190 --> 02:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
are the people you should be hearing
 
02:19:12.150 --> 02:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
from and talking to but I'm I appreciate
 
02:19:15.469 --> 02:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
the work that was done last year it it
 
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
it came out of the committee I think
 
02:19:20.750 --> 02:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
unanimous ly uh otpa and went through
 
02:19:22.230 --> 02:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
the house I'm not sure whether it was on
 
02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar but you yourself
 
02:19:27.629 --> 02:19:27.639 align:start position:0%
were there in the Senate after the bill
 
02:19:29.589 --> 02:19:29.599 align:start position:0%
passed and testified in the Senate and
 
02:19:31.990 --> 02:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
so forth and unfortunately the bill was
 
02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
not understood properly by uh by some
 
02:19:37.589 --> 02:19:37.599 align:start position:0%
members of the senate committee and thus
 
02:19:40.469 --> 02:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
it was it but this is an important issue
 
02:19:43.790 --> 02:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
so I recommend it to your to your
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
attention and to your competent
 
02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:47.990 align:start position:0%
attention and to your competent
assessment

02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:48.000 align:start position:0%

themselves um more often than not the
 
02:21:19.590 --> 02:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
orders that um come out of
 
02:21:22.389 --> 02:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
um the C the guard the probate Courts
 
02:21:25.030 --> 02:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
for guardianships do include language
 
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
that um suggest that the W should not
 
02:21:33.030 --> 02:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
have access to their records and so we
 
02:21:36.070 --> 02:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
think that that is more of um an
 
02:21:38.030 --> 02:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunate oversight and so we would
 
02:21:41.469 --> 02:21:41.479 align:start position:0%
like to correct the issue both for
 
02:21:43.429 --> 02:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
existing guardianships and for
 
02:21:46.389 --> 02:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
guardianships going forward so the first
 
02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
section of this bill um does talk about
 
02:21:55.230 --> 02:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
um uh how we address new guardianships
 
02:21:57.429 --> 02:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
and saying that we would like the court
 
02:22:04.469 --> 02:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
to find um that there is a reason to uh
 
02:22:06.270 --> 02:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
include in the order that the person
 
02:22:07.790 --> 02:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
should have their right to access
 
02:22:12.630 --> 02:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
records um um basically withheld and a
 
02:22:14.469 --> 02:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
finding that the person can no longer
 
02:22:16.389 --> 02:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
access their their medical or personal
 
02:22:16.399 --> 02:22:17.750 align:start position:0%
access their their medical or personal
records

02:22:17.750 --> 02:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
records
 
02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
and later on in the bill we talk about
 
02:22:22.670 --> 02:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
how we want somebody who's already under
 
02:22:25.710 --> 02:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
guardianship to who has an order that
 
02:22:27.270 --> 02:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
that might suggest that they shouldn't
 
02:22:29.110 --> 02:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
have access to their records or that
 
02:22:31.309 --> 02:22:31.319 align:start position:0%
it's unclear whether they should have
 
02:22:33.389 --> 02:22:33.399 align:start position:0%
access to their records that there's an
 
02:22:35.309 --> 02:22:35.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them to approach the
 
02:22:38.990 --> 02:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
court to find a way to obtain access to
 
02:22:40.990 --> 02:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
their records and this can occur in many
 
02:22:44.030 --> 02:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
different circumstances either when
 
02:22:46.389 --> 02:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
somebody is trying to remove or change
 
02:22:48.510 --> 02:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
their their guard Guardian whether
 
02:22:50.349 --> 02:22:50.359 align:start position:0%
they're trying to terminate their
 
02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
guardianship due to various reasons or
 
02:22:57.190 --> 02:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
whether um they want to just amend the
 
02:22:59.309 --> 02:22:59.319 align:start position:0%
terms of their guardianship that in
 
02:23:01.070 --> 02:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
order to do a lot of those things they
 
02:23:03.550 --> 02:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
need access to their own records so they
 
02:23:05.710 --> 02:23:05.720 align:start position:0%
understand what their personal assets
 
02:23:07.670 --> 02:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
are what their medical records might
 
02:23:11.070 --> 02:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
State and so this gives them an Avenue
 
02:23:13.469 --> 02:23:13.479 align:start position:0%
to approach the court approach their
 
02:23:17.469 --> 02:23:17.479 align:start position:0%
Guardian for um for access to those
 
02:23:21.710 --> 02:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
personal records what we see uh what I
 
02:23:28.150 --> 02:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
tend to see myself um is that um a lot
 
02:23:30.190 --> 02:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
of the wards
 
02:23:33.670 --> 02:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
here um under guardianship feel that
 
02:23:35.469 --> 02:23:35.479 align:start position:0%
they have no right to access their
 
02:23:37.590 --> 02:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
records the Guardians do tend to tell
 
02:23:39.349 --> 02:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
them that they have no right to access
 
02:23:41.790 --> 02:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
their records uh and they don't really
 
02:23:43.950 --> 02:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
know how to move forward with that issue
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
and present it before the court
 
02:23:49.990 --> 02:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily so they more or less just
 
02:23:53.389 --> 02:23:53.399 align:start position:0%
agree and never access their own records
 
02:23:56.790 --> 02:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
we want this to be um clear um in both
 
02:24:01.309 --> 02:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
the Court's orders going forward um that
 
02:24:03.030 --> 02:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
they do have a right to access their
 
02:24:05.469 --> 02:24:05.479 align:start position:0%
records unless there is a good medical
 
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
reason for them not to access their
 
02:24:11.309 --> 02:24:11.319 align:start position:0%
records um or second that there is a way
 
02:24:14.469 --> 02:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
for them to to petition the court
 
02:24:17.230 --> 02:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
um in the you know for existing Guardian
 
02:24:19.790 --> 02:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
ships for them to to now seek permission
 
02:24:22.349 --> 02:24:22.359 align:start position:0%
from the court to access the records so
 
02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
essentially this is just allowing any
 
02:24:28.389 --> 02:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
person under a guardianship to obtain
 
02:24:30.389 --> 02:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
access to their records unless there is
 
02:24:34.349 --> 02:24:34.359 align:start position:0%
a good finding legal reason um found by
 
02:24:36.790 --> 02:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
the court for the person not to have
 
02:24:39.550 --> 02:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
access to those records all right thank
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
you Mr Rosenberg welcome I I apologize
 
02:24:45.309 --> 02:24:45.319 align:start position:0%
for being late I'm Karen Rosenberg the
 
02:24:47.830 --> 02:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
policy director of the disability rights
 
02:24:49.870 --> 02:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
I thought I could run faster than I can
 
02:24:51.990 --> 02:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
these days so I was trying to get some
 
02:24:54.550 --> 02:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
information for the sponsor but I think
 
02:24:57.389 --> 02:24:57.399 align:start position:0%
he probably so you know it m Rosenberg
 
02:24:59.750 --> 02:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
since I know you were very intimately
 
02:25:01.389 --> 02:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
involved in last year's Bill I just
 
02:25:03.429 --> 02:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
wanted I wanted to sort of ask the the
 
02:25:05.870 --> 02:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
same question to you that I asked uh to
 
02:25:08.309 --> 02:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
to representative Schmidt this bill that
 
02:25:11.230 --> 02:25:11.240 align:start position:0%
we have now before us is the exact bill
 
02:25:13.269 --> 02:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
that was passed by this committee and
 
02:25:15.510 --> 02:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
the whole house last year exactly the
 
02:25:16.510 --> 02:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
only thing that's different is the
 
02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
number everything else is exactly the
 
02:25:21.269 --> 02:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
same I so I I I didn't mean to interrupt
 
02:25:23.389 --> 02:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
you my my sense is at least I hope this
 
02:25:24.910 --> 02:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
is the case that you're preaching to the
 
02:25:27.670 --> 02:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
choir here um but please if there you
 
02:25:30.110 --> 02:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
know tell us I hope so too and I just
 
02:25:32.550 --> 02:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
think if anyone has any questions about
 
02:25:34.670 --> 02:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
the bill or concerns that have Arisen
 
02:25:37.070 --> 02:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
since last section that attorney Tasker
 
02:25:39.910 --> 02:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy to address
 
02:25:42.110 --> 02:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
them speaking for myself the only
 
02:25:44.190 --> 02:25:44.200 align:start position:0%
question that I had having testified
 
02:25:46.630 --> 02:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
before the other body the only question
 
02:25:48.349 --> 02:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
that I have which you are not in a
 
02:25:50.309 --> 02:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
position to answer
 
02:25:54.230 --> 02:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
is what what the problem was I just
 
02:25:56.710 --> 02:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
don't understand what this seemed like
 
02:25:58.510 --> 02:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
seems like a perfectly reasonable bill
 
02:26:00.070 --> 02:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
and I just don't understand what the
 
02:26:02.030 --> 02:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
problem was well of course we agree with
 
02:26:03.550 --> 02:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
you that it's perfectly reasonable and
 
02:26:05.550 --> 02:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
hope you will continue supporting it and
 
02:26:07.630 --> 02:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
I think we'll just have to do some more
 
02:26:10.230 --> 02:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
work and make sure that folks in the
 
02:26:12.590 --> 02:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
other body really understand what we're
 
02:26:16.269 --> 02:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish here and why so
 
02:26:18.790 --> 02:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
we'll do our fast great are there yes
 
02:26:22.110 --> 02:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
representative tur uh yeah just just one
 
02:26:24.550 --> 02:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
quick question and uh this may be more
 
02:26:29.190 --> 02:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
to our chair than to our our uh uh uh
 
02:26:31.670 --> 02:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
person giving testimony um this has the
 
02:26:34.309 --> 02:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
language in it the court shall issue an
 
02:26:36.830 --> 02:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
order um I just wanted to make sure as
 
02:26:38.190 --> 02:26:38.200 align:start position:0%
we're as we're going forward with that
 
02:26:41.110 --> 02:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
language that we it's it's acceptable
 
02:26:45.389 --> 02:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
for legislation to say the court shall
 
02:26:47.670 --> 02:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
issue an order yeah yes I think that I
 
02:26:49.510 --> 02:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
think yes I think that's I think I don't
 
02:26:51.870 --> 02:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
see any problem with
 
02:26:55.349 --> 02:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
that all right um any other questions
 
02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
for either of these
 
02:26:59.990 --> 02:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
Witnesses great thank you very much
 
02:27:01.910 --> 02:27:01.920 align:start position:0%

microphone oh yeah thank you red means
 
02:27:28.389 --> 02:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
on apparently not stop good morning Mr
 
02:27:30.070 --> 02:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee my
 
02:27:33.469 --> 02:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
name is Lisa Brit solski Stevens and I'm
 
02:27:35.710 --> 02:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
the incoming chief executive officer at
 
02:27:38.349 --> 02:27:38.359 align:start position:0%
the office of public Guardian um I feel
 
02:27:39.990 --> 02:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit like I've dropped into the
 
02:27:43.070 --> 02:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
Fifth Act of a play so please forgive me
 
02:27:46.269 --> 02:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
um I have been at OPG now for two months
 
02:27:49.790 --> 02:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
um and this bill came to my attention um
 
02:27:52.110 --> 02:27:52.120 align:start position:0%
we do have concerns I don't think they
 
02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:53.030 align:start position:0%
we do have concerns I don't think they
are

02:27:53.030 --> 02:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
insurmountable um I did reach out to
 
02:27:56.870 --> 02:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt who I have known
 
02:28:00.030 --> 02:28:00.040 align:start position:0%
for many years to understand um the
 
02:28:01.830 --> 02:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
origin and the intention and
 
02:28:04.429 --> 02:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I think January being what
 
02:28:06.950 --> 02:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
January is at the lob he was not able to
 
02:28:10.150 --> 02:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
get back to me um the Office of Public
 
02:28:12.429 --> 02:28:12.439 align:start position:0%
Guardian uh has guardianship over about
 
02:28:14.870 --> 02:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
1,200 Granite sters so we are the
 
02:28:17.710 --> 02:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
biggest game in town as it relates to
 
02:28:19.710 --> 02:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
the performance of Guardianship Services
 
02:28:21.630 --> 02:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
over adults in New
 
02:28:25.030 --> 02:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so our initial concerns
 
02:28:28.230 --> 02:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
are how this would increase our current
 
02:28:30.429 --> 02:28:30.439 align:start position:0%
workflow and how we would account for
 
02:28:32.750 --> 02:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
that with our funders who are primarily
 
02:28:33.870 --> 02:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
Services and the Department of
 
02:28:38.990 --> 02:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
Corrections um we also want to raise a
 
02:28:41.309 --> 02:28:41.319 align:start position:0%
concern um that there is a big
 
02:28:44.030 --> 02:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
difference between allowing one of our
 
02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
clients or Wards as they are referred
 
02:28:50.830 --> 02:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
ref to in the statute um to access their
 
02:28:53.710 --> 02:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
records as distinguished from being able
 
02:28:55.990 --> 02:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
to authorize the release of their
 
02:28:57.990 --> 02:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
records um and very different
 
02:29:00.550 --> 02:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
consideration should be applied in
 
02:29:02.710 --> 02:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
whether we are allowing access to that
 
02:29:05.269 --> 02:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
record or in fact saying that the award
 
02:29:07.110 --> 02:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
should that the award has the authority
 
02:29:10.230 --> 02:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
to release those records frequently the
 
02:29:13.710 --> 02:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
content of those records can be very
 
02:29:17.070 --> 02:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
disturbing for the ward um and and we
 
02:29:19.309 --> 02:29:19.319 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we have a enough
 
02:29:21.950 --> 02:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
protective measure in distinguishing
 
02:29:25.349 --> 02:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
between access and authority to release
 
02:29:27.590 --> 02:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
um I would look forward to the
 
02:29:30.710 --> 02:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to connect with Karen and
 
02:29:33.309 --> 02:29:33.319 align:start position:0%
her colleague from the DRC again I feel
 
02:29:34.950 --> 02:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
like I've dropped into the Fifth Act of
 
02:29:37.550 --> 02:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
an ongoing play um but we did feel at
 
02:29:40.309 --> 02:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
OPG it was important to show up today
 
02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
and be heard okay questions for this
 
02:29:45.870 --> 02:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
witness representative Alexander um
 
02:29:47.190 --> 02:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:29:49.990 --> 02:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
my question I guess I don't
 
02:29:53.429 --> 02:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
understand I I'm trying to understand in
 
02:29:53.439 --> 02:29:54.630 align:start position:0%
understand I I'm trying to understand in
what

02:29:54.630 --> 02:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:29:56.630 --> 02:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
situation like you don't have to give me
 
02:29:58.309 --> 02:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
a specific but in what situation would
 
02:29:59.870 --> 02:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
it not be in the best interest of the
 
02:30:03.469 --> 02:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
ward to have control over their own
 
02:30:07.950 --> 02:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
records an adult Ward absolutely um
 
02:30:10.110 --> 02:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
again sometimes the content of those
 
02:30:14.630 --> 02:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
records can be very disturbing it might
 
02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
recount trauma um and and things that
 
02:30:21.070 --> 02:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
that individual has spent perhaps most
 
02:30:24.510 --> 02:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
of their life trying to adjust to and be
 
02:30:28.110 --> 02:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
able to be as independent as possible
 
02:30:32.510 --> 02:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
despite the sequele of that trauma um
 
02:30:34.830 --> 02:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
again there we feel like there is a very
 
02:30:36.990 --> 02:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
important distinction between having
 
02:30:39.670 --> 02:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
access to that record and then being
 
02:30:42.710 --> 02:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
able to authorize the release of that
 
02:30:45.750 --> 02:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
record so if I could just if I could
 
02:30:47.230 --> 02:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
just follow up what's the difference
 
02:30:48.469 --> 02:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
between the access and the release
 
02:30:49.830 --> 02:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
because it's still giving the trauma to
 
02:30:51.550 --> 02:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
the person that it's their own
 
02:30:53.150 --> 02:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
information so I
 
02:30:55.429 --> 02:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
guess yes you are coming into the Fifth
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
Act I feel like we've already looked
 
02:31:00.309 --> 02:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
into this kind of thing and I I guess
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering what more are you
 
02:31:05.030 --> 02:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
contributing that would make me pause on
 
02:31:07.590 --> 02:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
a bill that we've already passed and we
 
02:31:09.630 --> 02:31:09.640 align:start position:0%
think that somebody's information should
 
02:31:11.790 --> 02:31:11.800 align:start position:0%
be their own information to send out I
 
02:31:13.590 --> 02:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
guess I'm like give me something more to
 
02:31:16.190 --> 02:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
go on you're right I'm flat footed I
 
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
I've been at OPG now since the middle of
 
02:31:20.230 --> 02:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
November I'm surprised that nobody in
 
02:31:22.950 --> 02:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
the office had been engaged prior to now
 
02:31:26.230 --> 02:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to rectify that um the first
 
02:31:27.790 --> 02:31:27.800 align:start position:0%
thing that comes to mind though about
 
02:31:30.269 --> 02:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
the release is could that be being done
 
02:31:32.550 --> 02:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
in a retaliatory way because somebody
 
02:31:34.550 --> 02:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
has been named in those records as the
 
02:31:38.550 --> 02:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:43.070 --> 02:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:45.990 --> 02:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
Smith congratulations on your new job
 
02:31:48.429 --> 02:31:48.439 align:start position:0%
and welcome to the Judiciary Committee
 
02:31:51.429 --> 02:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
you certainly have had a long history of
 
02:31:55.630 --> 02:31:55.640 align:start position:0%
being involved in issues that are of our
 
02:31:58.150 --> 02:31:58.160 align:start position:0%
concern to all of us and that we
 
02:32:00.750 --> 02:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
share and I don't want to put you on the
 
02:32:04.830 --> 02:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
spot but I've put myself on the spot
 
02:32:07.750 --> 02:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
well a phrase comes to mind and I'm
 
02:32:10.830 --> 02:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
not you know I'm not a lawyer I don't
 
02:32:13.110 --> 02:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
play one on
 
02:32:16.550 --> 02:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
TV um but the phrase that comes to mind
 
02:32:19.150 --> 02:32:19.160 align:start position:0%
is not a phrase that I find attractive
 
02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
and it is in local
 
02:32:24.550 --> 02:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
parenes it is the assumption that
 
02:32:24.560 --> 02:32:25.590 align:start position:0%
parenes it is the assumption that
someone

02:32:25.590 --> 02:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
someone
 
02:32:25.600 --> 02:32:27.110 align:start position:0%
someone
else

02:32:27.110 --> 02:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
else
 
02:32:31.710 --> 02:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
has more power more right more
 
02:32:35.670 --> 02:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
authority to make decisions for me than
 
02:32:35.680 --> 02:32:36.670 align:start position:0%
authority to make decisions for me than
do

02:32:36.670 --> 02:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
I and do I or I do well I think either
 
02:32:44.269 --> 02:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
way is grammatically correct
 
02:32:47.070 --> 02:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:32:50.550 --> 02:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
I just wonder if this might be a
 
02:32:50.560 --> 02:32:53.550 align:start position:0%
I just wonder if this might be a
situation

02:32:53.550 --> 02:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:32:56.790 --> 02:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
where you H it might be possible that
 
02:33:00.070 --> 02:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
you haven't had a Time sufficient to be
 
02:33:03.190 --> 02:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
grounded in the history of this and why
 
02:33:05.590 --> 02:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
after a lot of research and a lot of
 
02:33:09.750 --> 02:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
time the decision was made to to support
 
02:33:12.630 --> 02:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
this I I think the the tail end of your
 
02:33:16.349 --> 02:33:16.359 align:start position:0%
commentary is spoton again I I rais this
 
02:33:19.070 --> 02:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
with the leadership team at OPG and they
 
02:33:21.110 --> 02:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
had not previously been engaged and that
 
02:33:23.790 --> 02:33:23.800 align:start position:0%
was a little bit of a surprise to me um
 
02:33:25.990 --> 02:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
we certainly are grateful for the
 
02:33:27.469 --> 02:33:27.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to participate in the
 
02:33:30.469 --> 02:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
conversation now um in terms of your
 
02:33:32.349 --> 02:33:32.359 align:start position:0%
introductory comment representative
 
02:33:35.349 --> 02:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
Smith I I couldn't agree more and I
 
02:33:39.150 --> 02:33:39.160 align:start position:0%
think that the the Guardians at OPG have
 
02:33:42.110 --> 02:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
probably the deepest understanding of
 
02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
the balance and a tremendous commitment
 
02:33:49.030 --> 02:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
to ensuring the ongoing Integrity of
 
02:33:52.550 --> 02:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
every ward in our charge um I'm sure it
 
02:33:54.550 --> 02:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
is no surprise to the committee that the
 
02:33:57.389 --> 02:33:57.399 align:start position:0%
burden of proof in determining that
 
02:33:59.790 --> 02:33:59.800 align:start position:0%
somebody is incapacitated to the degree
 
02:34:02.590 --> 02:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
that they cannot make those decisions
 
02:34:04.150 --> 02:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
that burden of proof though it is a
 
02:34:06.190 --> 02:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
civil proceeding is beyond a reasonable
 
02:34:09.070 --> 02:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
doubt and I think that is precisely at
 
02:34:11.910 --> 02:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
the ju toos of what you are describing
 
02:34:14.190 --> 02:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
that nobody would be under guardianship
 
02:34:16.389 --> 02:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
unless it had been demonstrated Beyond
 
02:34:18.510 --> 02:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable doubt that that was in their
 
02:34:20.230 --> 02:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
best interest and that they could do
 
02:34:24.550 --> 02:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
harm to themselves or to others um I I
 
02:34:27.349 --> 02:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
hope that's um responsive to to your
 
02:34:30.469 --> 02:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
question other questions so you know the
 
02:34:32.710 --> 02:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
thing I guess as I'm looking at this uh
 
02:34:37.269 --> 02:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
and it um the language that um that this
 
02:34:42.150 --> 02:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
bill changes um it it talks about to
 
02:34:44.590 --> 02:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
have access to or to Grant
 
02:34:47.710 --> 02:34:47.720 align:start position:0%
release um in section four and then if
 
02:34:50.870 --> 02:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
you go over to um
 
02:34:54.230 --> 02:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm sorry that was section one uh
 
02:34:57.910 --> 02:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh Roman numeral 4 on page uh one of the
 
02:35:00.429 --> 02:35:00.439 align:start position:0%
bill and then if you go over to section
 
02:35:04.030 --> 02:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
four of the bill it also talks about
 
02:35:04.040 --> 02:35:06.230 align:start position:0%
four of the bill it also talks about
um

02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:09.790 --> 02:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
uh the that the ward May uh the ward May
 
02:35:11.830 --> 02:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
request authority to access and Grant
 
02:35:14.590 --> 02:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
release to of his or her confidential
 
02:35:16.710 --> 02:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
records I don't see any in either of
 
02:35:18.309 --> 02:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
those sections that would that would
 
02:35:21.030 --> 02:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
prevent a court other words if there was
 
02:35:24.070 --> 02:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
a if you had a situation where you were
 
02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
saying to the court well we don't have
 
02:35:28.510 --> 02:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
any problem with the the release of the
 
02:35:32.510 --> 02:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
records of the Guardian to of the uh uh
 
02:35:34.630 --> 02:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
of the ward to the ward but we don't
 
02:35:36.469 --> 02:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
think the ward should be able to further
 
02:35:38.630 --> 02:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
release them uh there would I don't see
 
02:35:40.230 --> 02:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
anything in this would prevent you from
 
02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
making that argument to the court and if
 
02:35:44.190 --> 02:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
the court agreed with you they could do
 
02:35:47.309 --> 02:35:47.319 align:start position:0%
that I I mean I tend to share
 
02:35:49.349 --> 02:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
representative I think what the
 
02:35:51.110 --> 02:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
sentiment of Representative Smith and
 
02:35:53.309 --> 02:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander that would
 
02:35:56.309 --> 02:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
strike me that would be a it would be an
 
02:35:59.110 --> 02:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
unusual situation I would think where a
 
02:36:02.630 --> 02:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
court would say you can see the records
 
02:36:05.710 --> 02:36:05.720 align:start position:0%
Ward but you can't pass them on to
 
02:36:08.030 --> 02:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
somebody else maybe that would exist but
 
02:36:10.590 --> 02:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
I'd be that would seem to me to be
 
02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:11.670 align:start position:0%
I'd be that would seem to me to be
pretty

02:36:11.670 --> 02:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
02:36:14.550 --> 02:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
unusual and I think perhaps illustrates
 
02:36:16.030 --> 02:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
why it would have been so important for
 
02:36:18.030 --> 02:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
OPG to be a more meaningful part of the
 
02:36:20.429 --> 02:36:20.439 align:start position:0%
dialogue and I would enjoy the
 
02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be involved in the go
 
02:36:25.429 --> 02:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
forward ours is not to say this should
 
02:36:27.510 --> 02:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
not pass ours is to say we think we
 
02:36:30.990 --> 02:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
should be involved in readed in okay all
 
02:36:34.550 --> 02:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
right other yes representative Smith um
 
02:36:37.030 --> 02:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
I I don't think you'll be able to answer
 
02:36:41.429 --> 02:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
this but perhaps um one of our previous
 
02:36:45.349 --> 02:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
Witnesses could was there a specific
 
02:36:45.359 --> 02:36:46.950 align:start position:0%
Witnesses could was there a specific
action

02:36:46.950 --> 02:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
action
 
02:36:51.269 --> 02:36:51.279 align:start position:0%
ever taken to make sure that the Office
 
02:36:55.950 --> 02:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
of Public Guardian was not involved in
 
02:36:58.990 --> 02:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
everything leading up to the
 
02:37:03.190 --> 02:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
initial preparation of the
 
02:37:07.349 --> 02:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
bill last year and that then went
 
02:37:10.110 --> 02:37:10.120 align:start position:0%
publicly through the house through the
 
02:37:13.750 --> 02:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
committee the house and to the Senate I
 
02:37:17.230 --> 02:37:17.240 align:start position:0%
guess I'm not sure no one in the office
 
02:37:20.309 --> 02:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
of public Guardian saw fit to say hey we
 
02:37:22.309 --> 02:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
might have a
 
02:37:25.429 --> 02:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
problem I can't speak for my current
 
02:37:29.070 --> 02:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
colleagues I can say that as the newest
 
02:37:32.110 --> 02:37:32.120 align:start position:0%
member of the executive team and because
 
02:37:35.790 --> 02:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps of my long history of walking
 
02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
these halls I as a matter of custom
 
02:37:42.710 --> 02:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
review the lsrs and review the bills and
 
02:37:47.750 --> 02:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
I said guys what do you think about this
 
02:37:50.190 --> 02:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
um I would like to give them all space
 
02:37:51.910 --> 02:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
and grace and the benefit of the doubt
 
02:37:55.110 --> 02:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
that um this might be something new to
 
02:37:55.120 --> 02:37:57.269 align:start position:0%
that um this might be something new to
their

02:37:57.269 --> 02:37:57.279 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:38:00.710 --> 02:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
calendar I'm sure you'll be adding some
 
02:38:02.590 --> 02:38:02.600 align:start position:0%
valuable strength to the work of the
 
02:38:05.510 --> 02:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
office you're very kind thank you uh yes
 
02:38:05.520 --> 02:38:07.070 align:start position:0%
office you're very kind thank you uh yes
representative

02:38:07.070 --> 02:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:38:10.070 --> 02:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
Lonzo um thank you for uh taking my
 
02:38:14.269 --> 02:38:14.279 align:start position:0%
question so in thinking about when um a
 
02:38:17.750 --> 02:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
person who is in capacitate and is not
 
02:38:20.670 --> 02:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
um is seeking to get their records um
 
02:38:23.030 --> 02:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
first of all would it be the guardian's
 
02:38:26.510 --> 02:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
um position to actually uh review those
 
02:38:30.269 --> 02:38:30.279 align:start position:0%
records with that person um to go over
 
02:38:33.070 --> 02:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
those records um and especially if
 
02:38:34.830 --> 02:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
somebody really wants to know what
 
02:38:37.150 --> 02:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
they're you know they're seeking their
 
02:38:39.150 --> 02:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
records They want to know exactly what's
 
02:38:44.070 --> 02:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
going on um it's the guardian Guardians
 
02:38:47.630 --> 02:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
P um is they are for that person um and
 
02:38:49.230 --> 02:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
they should be allowed
 
02:38:54.230 --> 02:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
to um should they not be allowed to um
 
02:38:56.750 --> 02:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
sit down with that guardian and and
 
02:38:59.790 --> 02:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
review their records with
 
02:39:02.349 --> 02:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
them I think it's important to clarify
 
02:39:04.830 --> 02:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
that a guardian is not part of the Care
 
02:39:07.750 --> 02:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
team for any of these individuals they
 
02:39:11.750 --> 02:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
represent largely a legal status um and
 
02:39:14.150 --> 02:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure all of you can appreciate
 
02:39:17.070 --> 02:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
not all people under guardianship want
 
02:39:22.070 --> 02:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
to be under guardianship so they have um
 
02:39:25.469 --> 02:39:25.479 align:start position:0%
an appropriately distanced relationship
 
02:39:26.870 --> 02:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
there is information that they
 
02:39:30.070 --> 02:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely share um and then there are
 
02:39:32.950 --> 02:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
also people under guardianship who have
 
02:39:35.550 --> 02:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
very strong ties to their guardian and
 
02:39:37.110 --> 02:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
work very
 
02:39:40.030 --> 02:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
collaboratively um but I can't say that
 
02:39:42.750 --> 02:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
be customary to sort of have that
 
02:39:49.830 --> 02:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
caregiver kind of relationship I think
 
02:39:51.550 --> 02:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
it would be more likely that the
 
02:39:55.429 --> 02:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
guardian would Express concern about
 
02:39:57.389 --> 02:39:57.399 align:start position:0%
what that person might see in their
 
02:39:59.349 --> 02:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
record and encourage them to work
 
02:40:03.550 --> 02:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:07.309 --> 02:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
team other questions for this witness
 
02:40:10.030 --> 02:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
right you know ma'am I just want to just
 
02:40:13.429 --> 02:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
want to um say and I I I please
 
02:40:16.590 --> 02:40:16.600 align:start position:0%
understand we um this is in no way meant
 
02:40:18.910 --> 02:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
as a you know in any kind of criticism
 
02:40:21.469 --> 02:40:21.479 align:start position:0%
of view um but in light of the history
 
02:40:24.550 --> 02:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
of this bill um we we may I'm not sure
 
02:40:26.349 --> 02:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
if we're going to but you I just want to
 
02:40:28.469 --> 02:40:28.479 align:start position:0%
let you know that we may decide if the
 
02:40:30.830 --> 02:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
ranking member and myself agree that we
 
02:40:33.030 --> 02:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
would exec this bill today given its
 
02:40:35.309 --> 02:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
given its history and what I would say
 
02:40:37.469 --> 02:40:37.479 align:start position:0%
is to the extent that there you know
 
02:40:40.670 --> 02:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
that there are concerns that you would
 
02:40:43.349 --> 02:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
like to you know bring forward um
 
02:40:45.110 --> 02:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
obviously the fact that we execute and
 
02:40:46.870 --> 02:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
even pass it in the house doesn't mean
 
02:40:48.550 --> 02:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
that it's becomes the law it's got to go
 
02:40:50.710 --> 02:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
to the other body um and so you will
 
02:40:51.630 --> 02:40:51.640 align:start position:0%
have an
 
02:40:53.790 --> 02:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh you know to raise the
 
02:40:56.790 --> 02:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
concerns uh there and I would also
 
02:40:58.990 --> 02:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
suggest I think you know there are
 
02:41:00.550 --> 02:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
you've you've heard there are several
 
02:41:03.190 --> 02:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
witnesses here um who have testified I'm
 
02:41:04.750 --> 02:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
sure would be happy to meet with you and
 
02:41:07.590 --> 02:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
talk with you about this and so um but I
 
02:41:10.190 --> 02:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
do think you know we've got a very busy
 
02:41:12.910 --> 02:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
House schedule um and to the extent that
 
02:41:14.670 --> 02:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
we can exec things particularly things
 
02:41:16.910 --> 02:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
that we've already sort of done the
 
02:41:19.750 --> 02:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
dance before it it's in our interest to
 
02:41:21.150 --> 02:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
move forward so I just want to let you
 
02:41:22.950 --> 02:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
know that and it certainly mean no
 
02:41:25.110 --> 02:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
disrespect to you in any way thank you
 
02:41:27.230 --> 02:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
so much I appreciate that thank you very
 
02:41:31.469 --> 02:41:31.479 align:start position:0%
much right is there anyone else um here
 
02:41:35.190 --> 02:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
who wishes to testify on House Bill
 
02:41:41.190 --> 02:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:45.830 --> 02:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
a yes so we have uh among the people who
 
02:41:48.110 --> 02:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
just signed in we have three supporting
 
02:41:49.510 --> 02:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
and zero
 
02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:56.710 align:start position:0%
and zero
opposed

02:41:56.710 --> 02:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:00.990 --> 02:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
um sure come on up representative yala
 
02:42:02.990 --> 02:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to get to you I
 
02:42:06.750 --> 02:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:10.349 --> 02:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
right I'll be quick um I just as far as
 
02:42:12.710 --> 02:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
the issue that was raised about possible
 
02:42:16.269 --> 02:42:16.279 align:start position:0%
harm to the ward the bill as written
 
02:42:18.309 --> 02:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
actually provides guard rails that I
 
02:42:21.630 --> 02:42:21.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to call your attention to so if
 
02:42:23.309 --> 02:42:23.319 align:start position:0%
there's not a
 
02:42:26.469 --> 02:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
determination that on this issue about
 
02:42:29.070 --> 02:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
whether the ward can have access to
 
02:42:31.590 --> 02:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
their records and they request access
 
02:42:33.190 --> 02:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
from their Guardian if the guardian
 
02:42:35.429 --> 02:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
feels that it would be harmful the
 
02:42:37.550 --> 02:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
guardian can then petition the court for
 
02:42:41.469 --> 02:42:41.479 align:start position:0%
an order and similarly um if the ward is
 
02:42:43.550 --> 02:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
Seeking a modification or they're
 
02:42:45.469 --> 02:42:45.479 align:start position:0%
seeking to change Guardians and their
 
02:42:47.870 --> 02:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
asking for permission um they petition
 
02:42:49.429 --> 02:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
the court themselves for permission to
 
02:42:51.790 --> 02:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
see their records the court then would
 
02:42:54.150 --> 02:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to determine
 
02:42:56.309 --> 02:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
whether providing such access would be
 
02:42:58.830 --> 02:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
harmful and the guardian would have the
 
02:43:01.150 --> 02:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to weigh in on that so I
 
02:43:03.510 --> 02:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to put your minds at ease
 
02:43:05.590 --> 02:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
about this there are some guard rails to
 
02:43:07.910 --> 02:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
protect people if it would be harmful
 
02:43:09.309 --> 02:43:09.319 align:start position:0%
and just because someone's under
 
02:43:11.230 --> 02:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
guardianship doesn't automatically mean
 
02:43:13.190 --> 02:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
that they are stripped of all of their
 
02:43:15.750 --> 02:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
rights that an adult would enjoy courts
 
02:43:18.870 --> 02:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
are required under law to consider
 
02:43:21.070 --> 02:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
specifically which rights they're taking
 
02:43:23.510 --> 02:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
away and why and affirming that the
 
02:43:25.630 --> 02:43:25.640 align:start position:0%
person due to their incapacity is unable
 
02:43:27.429 --> 02:43:27.439 align:start position:0%
to exercise those
 
02:43:29.990 --> 02:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
rights questions for this
 
02:43:32.550 --> 02:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
witness oh yes representative
 
02:43:36.150 --> 02:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
Smith I don't want to delay it um if if
 
02:43:38.230 --> 02:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
you are under guardianship are you
 
02:43:40.870 --> 02:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
permitted to vote unless the court says
 
02:43:43.670 --> 02:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
you're not yes you are permitted to
 
02:43:46.670 --> 02:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
vote other question for this witness
 
02:43:48.389 --> 02:43:48.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for having
 
02:43:51.389 --> 02:43:51.399 align:start position:0%
me again anyone else who wishes to
 
02:43:54.190 --> 02:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill
 
02:43:56.670 --> 02:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
1245 seeing none I'm going to close the

you about this today and especially
 
02:45:13.309 --> 02:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
because um this
 
02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
bill is really a right to know bill um
 
02:45:22.110 --> 02:45:22.120 align:start position:0%
and you guys have a lot of expertise in
 
02:45:24.670 --> 02:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
that area that that will be able to be
 
02:45:26.870 --> 02:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
brought to bear on this
 
02:45:32.830 --> 02:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
issue um I uh the Genesis of this this
 
02:45:38.150 --> 02:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
bill goes back a number of years um and
 
02:45:42.710 --> 02:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
I have been working with uh with my
 
02:45:45.750 --> 02:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
municipality and uh
 
02:45:48.990 --> 02:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
the municipal and County government uh
 
02:45:53.110 --> 02:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
or Municipal Association sorry uh
 
02:45:56.750 --> 02:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
regarding right to know and why um
 
02:45:59.590 --> 02:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
there's not more
 
02:46:03.710 --> 02:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
uh access to the right to know documents
 
02:46:07.269 --> 02:46:07.279 align:start position:0%
I definitely um you know at my
 
02:46:09.510 --> 02:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
municipality a lot of those records are
 
02:46:12.630 --> 02:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
just stored in boxes up in some filing
 
02:46:16.190 --> 02:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
cabinet and um if you're asking about
 
02:46:18.710 --> 02:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
something that wasn't in the last six
 
02:46:20.389 --> 02:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
months or something they're going to be
 
02:46:23.150 --> 02:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
like uh that's going to be hard to find
 
02:46:25.309 --> 02:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere you know especially if there
 
02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
was some turnover in the office and the
 
02:46:29.429 --> 02:46:29.439 align:start position:0%
person um currently in that office
 
02:46:32.070 --> 02:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't the person that filed that that
 
02:46:36.190 --> 02:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
document um there is some concern about
 
02:46:39.870 --> 02:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
that and some hesitation and um that can
 
02:46:42.630 --> 02:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
create one kind of a chilling effect on
 
02:46:44.790 --> 02:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
the person requesting it that that it's
 
02:46:46.389 --> 02:46:46.399 align:start position:0%
going to be a burden on their town which
 
02:46:50.110 --> 02:46:50.120 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to impose necessarily
 
02:46:56.269 --> 02:46:56.279 align:start position:0%
and also from the uh from the town uh
 
02:46:58.750 --> 02:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
just uh feeling overwhelmed that they
 
02:47:02.309 --> 02:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
have many things to do and that uh that
 
02:47:04.670 --> 02:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a burden on them every
 
02:47:07.389 --> 02:47:07.399 align:start position:0%
time there's a right to no request um
 
02:47:11.429 --> 02:47:11.439 align:start position:0%
and I think that one option that would
 
02:47:14.429 --> 02:47:14.439 align:start position:0%
be uh a win-win win for everyone
 
02:47:18.389 --> 02:47:18.399 align:start position:0%
involved is to have those records online
 
02:47:21.190 --> 02:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
and um a lot of municipalities are
 
02:47:23.510 --> 02:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
starting to do that with their current
 
02:47:27.030 --> 02:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
records um however there's space
 
02:47:28.590 --> 02:47:28.600 align:start position:0%
constraints on their website and they
 
02:47:30.750 --> 02:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
may pull them down if they feel like
 
02:47:33.070 --> 02:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
they're you know old and people are not
 
02:47:36.429 --> 02:47:36.439 align:start position:0%
regularly using them uh and so to cut
 
02:47:38.790 --> 02:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
down cost they may limit to only the you
 
02:47:41.030 --> 02:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
know current stuff uh within the last
 
02:47:42.429 --> 02:47:42.439 align:start position:0%
six months or a year or something like
 
02:47:45.190 --> 02:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
that on their website and then there's
 
02:47:49.389 --> 02:47:49.399 align:start position:0%
uh and so this bill is here to kind of
 
02:47:53.990 --> 02:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
create a central repository at the State
 
02:47:57.630 --> 02:47:57.640 align:start position:0%
uh for those right to know documents if
 
02:48:00.230 --> 02:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
the municipality chooses to upload them
 
02:48:03.550 --> 02:48:03.560 align:start position:0%
to that um it's completely opt in it's
 
02:48:05.349 --> 02:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
completely at the discretion of the
 
02:48:08.150 --> 02:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
municipality how much or how little they
 
02:48:11.110 --> 02:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
want to um take advantage of this option
 
02:48:15.030 --> 02:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
that the state would give them um there
 
02:48:18.389 --> 02:48:18.399 align:start position:0%
is uh the the website would be housed at
 
02:48:21.429 --> 02:48:21.439 align:start position:0%
the office of the um
 
02:48:25.630 --> 02:48:25.640 align:start position:0%
archist and uh they have the expertise
 
02:48:27.950 --> 02:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
and have already done some due diligence
 
02:48:30.510 --> 02:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
around this and what technology that
 
02:48:33.309 --> 02:48:33.319 align:start position:0%
they would like to use or um
 
02:48:34.950 --> 02:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
specifically technology that has been
 
02:48:36.990 --> 02:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
used around the country for this exact
 
02:48:41.670 --> 02:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
purpose and have um uh High degree of
 
02:48:43.469 --> 02:48:43.479 align:start position:0%
certainty that the records will be kept
 
02:48:45.389 --> 02:48:45.399 align:start position:0%
and maintained and stuff like that
 
02:48:51.190 --> 02:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
and also they are very uh happy to be
 
02:48:54.150 --> 02:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
able to use this uh local record or
 
02:48:57.550 --> 02:48:57.560 align:start position:0%
local government records manager for
 
02:49:00.389 --> 02:49:00.399 align:start position:0%
training and and helping
 
02:49:03.070 --> 02:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities fulfill their their
 
02:49:05.110 --> 02:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
obligations to retain these records and
 
02:49:07.790 --> 02:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
keep them um currently that local
 
02:49:11.510 --> 02:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
records manager is in statute already um
 
02:49:13.550 --> 02:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
that position it's just never been
 
02:49:17.070 --> 02:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
funded and and um so that position is
 
02:49:19.309 --> 02:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
not filled and they have a limited
 
02:49:20.910 --> 02:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
capacity to be able to help
 
02:49:23.429 --> 02:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities right now this would
 
02:49:25.269 --> 02:49:25.279 align:start position:0%
essentially allow them to hire that
 
02:49:28.349 --> 02:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
person and provide even in addition to
 
02:49:31.030 --> 02:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
the website more uh services to the
 
02:49:33.750 --> 02:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
communities about how to um preserve
 
02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:34.910 align:start position:0%
communities about how to um preserve
these

02:49:34.910 --> 02:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:49:38.510 --> 02:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
records um the win and so the win for
 
02:49:41.269 --> 02:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
the public is the access to those
 
02:49:43.349 --> 02:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
records all the time without even having
 
02:49:44.950 --> 02:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
to do a right to no request they can
 
02:49:47.510 --> 02:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
just go on the website and start pulling
 
02:49:49.670 --> 02:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
down stuff I did that this weekend with
 
02:49:52.389 --> 02:49:52.399 align:start position:0%
this the website uh one of the websites
 
02:49:54.269 --> 02:49:54.279 align:start position:0%
that I I emailed the committee about on
 
02:49:56.750 --> 02:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
Sunday with Texas I watched some video
 
02:50:01.229 --> 02:50:01.239 align:start position:0%
about uh their their drought in the 80s
 
02:50:03.389 --> 02:50:03.399 align:start position:0%
or something like that and being able to
 
02:50:05.389 --> 02:50:05.399 align:start position:0%
do that on that website without a right
 
02:50:09.590 --> 02:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
right to no request or anything um is is
 
02:50:12.469 --> 02:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the public and and that
 
02:50:14.750 --> 02:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
transparency that we're looking for that
 
02:50:18.150 --> 02:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
is guaranteed in the Constitution um
 
02:50:21.190 --> 02:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
very happy that that will be be
 
02:50:23.710 --> 02:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
addressed by this um as far as the
 
02:50:27.269 --> 02:50:27.279 align:start position:0%
public is concerned the state has that
 
02:50:30.150 --> 02:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
ability to help the the municipality get
 
02:50:32.190 --> 02:50:32.200 align:start position:0%
these records out and then specifically
 
02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:33.030 align:start position:0%
these records out and then specifically
the

02:50:33.030 --> 02:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:50:36.670 --> 02:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
municipality to the extent that they um
 
02:50:39.630 --> 02:50:39.640 align:start position:0%
that they abide by the the guidance from
 
02:50:41.670 --> 02:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
the archist and upload this these
 
02:50:45.349 --> 02:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
documents to the the website under this
 
02:50:48.190 --> 02:50:48.200 align:start position:0%
bill they would be uh relieved of the
 
02:50:51.469 --> 02:50:51.479 align:start position:0%
responsibility to fill those 91a
 
02:50:54.710 --> 02:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
requests in physical form um they would
 
02:50:57.150 --> 02:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
just be providing the website address
 
02:50:59.349 --> 02:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
for um those any records that they
 
02:51:02.150 --> 02:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
uploaded to the website um instead of
 
02:51:04.389 --> 02:51:04.399 align:start position:0%
you know filing going through all of
 
02:51:07.269 --> 02:51:07.279 align:start position:0%
those records um saving the municipality
 
02:51:09.790 --> 02:51:09.800 align:start position:0%
time and money and incentivizing the
 
02:51:13.150 --> 02:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
municip municipality to do um and upload
 
02:51:15.830 --> 02:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
more so that every document that they
 
02:51:18.750 --> 02:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
upload they reduce that that liability
 
02:51:20.950 --> 02:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh for potential right to know uh
 
02:51:26.630 --> 02:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:31.110 --> 02:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
I uh so I did want to I did excuse me I
 
02:51:34.510 --> 02:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
did want to bring the the committee's
 
02:51:37.630 --> 02:51:37.640 align:start position:0%
attention to um RSA
 
02:51:41.229 --> 02:51:41.239 align:start position:0%
33a already allows for municipalities to
 
02:51:43.550 --> 02:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
store records digitally entirely
 
02:51:43.560 --> 02:51:45.110 align:start position:0%
store records digitally entirely
digitally

02:51:45.110 --> 02:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
digitally
 
02:51:49.790 --> 02:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
they but most municipalities don't do
 
02:51:52.830 --> 02:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
that and one of the questions was why
 
02:51:56.389 --> 02:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
and part of uh that law requires that
 
02:51:59.590 --> 02:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
they be be accessible um and so even if
 
02:52:02.830 --> 02:52:02.840 align:start position:0%
they store them as PDFs or whatever um
 
02:52:04.269 --> 02:52:04.279 align:start position:0%
um it's in the law that they have to
 
02:52:07.229 --> 02:52:07.239 align:start position:0%
store it as pdfa or or other things that
 
02:52:11.830 --> 02:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
were were granted by uh by the archist
 
02:52:14.229 --> 02:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
or the Secretary of State um why aren't
 
02:52:16.990 --> 02:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
they doing that and I believe that that
 
02:52:19.750 --> 02:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
the accessibility option is kind of an
 
02:52:21.870 --> 02:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
unknown right now they have paper they
 
02:52:24.670 --> 02:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
know how to get it and and the
 
02:52:28.710 --> 02:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
accessibility has kind of a well uh Worn
 
02:52:31.389 --> 02:52:31.399 align:start position:0%
Path but the accessibility for these
 
02:52:33.349 --> 02:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
electronic documents is kind of an
 
02:52:36.510 --> 02:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
unknown Wild West um because no one
 
02:52:38.670 --> 02:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
really has has paved the path for them
 
02:52:40.950 --> 02:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
and I think that th this will pave the
 
02:52:43.670 --> 02:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
path for them if the state um pavs that
 
02:52:45.670 --> 02:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
path to that accessibility and then
 
02:52:48.670 --> 02:52:48.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities will be um much more
 
02:52:51.269 --> 02:52:51.279 align:start position:0%
encouraged to to utilize that option so
 
02:52:52.870 --> 02:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm happy to answer any
 
02:52:55.910 --> 02:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this witness uh
 
02:52:57.910 --> 02:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you thanks
 
02:52:59.550 --> 02:52:59.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I have two quick
 
02:53:01.389 --> 02:53:01.399 align:start position:0%
questions so it would be the
 
02:53:04.349 --> 02:53:04.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the municipality to
 
02:53:07.550 --> 02:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
upload these documents correct thank you
 
02:53:10.630 --> 02:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
for the for the question um yes it would
 
02:53:13.110 --> 02:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
be the the the guidance would be issued
 
02:53:14.670 --> 02:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
from the state archist and would be
 
02:53:17.110 --> 02:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
trained on how to do it um they could
 
02:53:20.630 --> 02:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
also hire a third party to do that if um
 
02:53:23.269 --> 02:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
the example I was thinking of for for my
 
02:53:25.830 --> 02:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
town I went personally and scanned
 
02:53:28.670 --> 02:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
essentially all of their documents um
 
02:53:30.510 --> 02:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
and so I know the amount of work that it
 
02:53:33.269 --> 02:53:33.279 align:start position:0%
would take kind of to how much we're
 
02:53:35.950 --> 02:53:35.960 align:start position:0%
talking about and I also considered um
 
02:53:38.550 --> 02:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
the possibility of putting a warrant
 
02:53:40.229 --> 02:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
article or something on the on the
 
02:53:42.469 --> 02:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
ballot to say hey we're going to raise
 
02:53:44.830 --> 02:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
uh $25,000 to essentially do our
 
02:53:47.150 --> 02:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
backstock of stuff and hire someone
 
02:53:49.429 --> 02:53:49.439 align:start position:0%
contract them to scan it and upload it
 
02:53:52.790 --> 02:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
to the website um that is another way it
 
02:53:54.349 --> 02:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily have to be the
 
02:53:57.110 --> 02:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
current staff um and give the option to
 
02:53:58.710 --> 02:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers if they want to do that or
 
02:54:01.750 --> 02:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
not right my second question thank
 
02:54:04.510 --> 02:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
you a concern about who picks and
 
02:54:07.590 --> 02:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
chooses what they decide to
 
02:54:12.389 --> 02:54:12.399 align:start position:0%
upload thank you for uh the question the
 
02:54:16.110 --> 02:54:16.120 align:start position:0%
the qu the the question of who decides
 
02:54:17.870 --> 02:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
is up to the municipality the
 
02:54:22.550 --> 02:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
municipality can choose um either um by
 
02:54:25.990 --> 02:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
board or or they can have uh you know
 
02:54:28.349 --> 02:54:28.359 align:start position:0%
the Selectmen put some guidance
 
02:54:30.349 --> 02:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
documents and and kind of put it out to
 
02:54:34.110 --> 02:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
all the the people that they want to um
 
02:54:38.030 --> 02:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
you know have this board or the entire
 
02:54:40.110 --> 02:54:40.120 align:start position:0%
uh amount of documents that are
 
02:54:42.229 --> 02:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
currently being generated uploaded I I
 
02:54:45.389 --> 02:54:45.399 align:start position:0%
think that um
 
02:54:47.590 --> 02:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
the the amount of effort is going to be
 
02:54:49.790 --> 02:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
for the current documents to upload to
 
02:54:52.309 --> 02:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
the website um many municipalities are
 
02:54:53.830 --> 02:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
already doing it to their own website
 
02:54:56.910 --> 02:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
and so I I think that uh it would
 
02:54:59.910 --> 02:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
probably be just instead of or on top of
 
02:55:03.510 --> 02:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
that and so not any additional real work
 
02:55:05.349 --> 02:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
by those
 
02:55:08.550 --> 02:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities other representative
 
02:55:11.030 --> 02:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
Andrews thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:55:11.040 --> 02:55:12.830 align:start position:0%
Andrews thank you Mr chair thank you for
taking

02:55:12.830 --> 02:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
taking
 
02:55:16.550 --> 02:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
my sorry about that and a couple of them
 
02:55:19.790 --> 02:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
what is a person going to do that
 
02:55:23.070 --> 02:55:23.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't have internet and we have a many
 
02:55:25.590 --> 02:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
people in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:55:29.510 --> 02:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
that do not have any internet access so
 
02:55:31.830 --> 02:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question um
 
02:55:37.670 --> 02:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
I am going to uh direct you to page two
 
02:55:40.870 --> 02:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh lines two and three of the amendment
 
02:55:44.710 --> 02:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
specifically um essentially what what
 
02:55:48.429 --> 02:55:48.439 align:start position:0%
what we are going to
 
02:55:52.269 --> 02:55:52.279 align:start position:0%
um have is is that not only are you
 
02:55:54.269 --> 02:55:54.279 align:start position:0%
following the guidance of the the
 
02:55:56.990 --> 02:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
municipa or the state archist on how to
 
02:55:59.429 --> 02:55:59.439 align:start position:0%
upload it but you also if you're going
 
02:56:02.550 --> 02:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
to not keep those records at your your
 
02:56:04.950 --> 02:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
municipality anymore you need to be able
 
02:56:10.030 --> 02:56:10.040 align:start position:0%
to give access to uh the website for
 
02:56:12.870 --> 02:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
costree access to the website um in the
 
02:56:15.389 --> 02:56:15.399 align:start position:0%
municipality so if they were able you
 
02:56:18.269 --> 02:56:18.279 align:start position:0%
know to go to the library or go to the
 
02:56:21.950 --> 02:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
town hall to be able to fulfill that um
 
02:56:24.630 --> 02:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
that copy uh or be able to get that
 
02:56:27.750 --> 02:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
record in a c costree way to them um
 
02:56:30.150 --> 02:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
then that would fulfill that
 
02:56:32.670 --> 02:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility however um that's kind of
 
02:56:34.830 --> 02:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
at a town by Town basis if they don't if
 
02:56:36.990 --> 02:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
they don't wish to do that then then
 
02:56:39.110 --> 02:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
they would still just have to go to the
 
02:56:40.830 --> 02:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
uh the town office for that right to no
 
02:56:42.510 --> 02:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
request as they do
 
02:56:44.670 --> 02:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
today okay second
 
02:56:48.590 --> 02:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
question uh there's 234 municipalities
 
02:56:49.950 --> 02:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
in the state of New
 
02:56:53.870 --> 02:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire let's say even half of them
 
02:56:57.590 --> 02:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
even some of your big cities MH did this
 
02:56:59.550 --> 02:56:59.560 align:start position:0%
it says in here it's only going to cost
 
02:57:02.670 --> 02:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
about 150,000 for the state to set this
 
02:57:05.950 --> 02:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
up I don't believe it's an accurate
 
02:57:12.990 --> 02:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
figure thank you for the statement
 
02:57:17.309 --> 02:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
um however um the the figure came from
 
02:57:20.469 --> 02:57:20.479 align:start position:0%
the state archist um uh about the
 
02:57:25.150 --> 02:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
150,000 is one for uh about 100,000 for
 
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
the actual person to help train um uh
 
02:57:31.750 --> 02:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
the local records manager and then the
 
02:57:35.070 --> 02:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
50,000 is for the uh the actual website
 
02:57:38.150 --> 02:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
and uh in the email that I sent you this
 
02:57:43.990 --> 02:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
weekend they it included the uh the uh
 
02:57:46.349 --> 02:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
quote from the the place that she's
 
02:57:49.269 --> 02:57:49.279 align:start position:0%
planning to go and it came to
 
02:57:52.950 --> 02:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
$50,000 um so you know if it is widely
 
02:57:56.790 --> 02:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
adopted may we we have to you know buy
 
02:57:58.550 --> 02:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
another you know some more storage
 
02:58:01.590 --> 02:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
capacity or whatever yes but the storage
 
02:58:06.429 --> 02:58:06.439 align:start position:0%
capacity is is not that expensive the
 
02:58:08.870 --> 02:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you other questions
 
02:58:12.550 --> 02:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
for this representative tur um yeah
 
02:58:14.389 --> 02:58:14.399 align:start position:0%
thanks and thanks for taking question
 
02:58:16.469 --> 02:58:16.479 align:start position:0%
the question I'm going to preface it I
 
02:58:18.990 --> 02:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
guess uh with the idea that and and
 
02:58:20.429 --> 02:58:20.439 align:start position:0%
excuse me this is my first time working
 
02:58:23.550 --> 02:58:23.560 align:start position:0%
with a non-main Amendment
 
02:58:27.309 --> 02:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
um uh this is being amended to a bill
 
02:58:30.710 --> 02:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
that we have haven't uh finished working
 
02:58:32.229 --> 02:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
with yet and it's a bill that I
 
02:58:35.309 --> 02:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
particularly liked um I know there's
 
02:58:37.349 --> 02:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
another amendment potentially to be
 
02:58:39.710 --> 02:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
offered that would combine this with
 
02:58:42.590 --> 02:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
another bill uh and it's a bill that I
 
02:58:46.229 --> 02:58:46.239 align:start position:0%
don't par particularly like as much um
 
02:58:48.870 --> 02:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
so I guess my my going back and I know
 
02:58:50.550 --> 02:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
you have probably no say in exactly
 
02:58:52.349 --> 02:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
where this ended up
 
02:58:55.790 --> 02:58:55.800 align:start position:0%
um I guess could you explain what
 
02:58:57.349 --> 02:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
because we're looking at an amendment to
 
02:59:02.030 --> 02:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
your original Bill what it I assume um
 
02:59:05.670 --> 02:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
Maybe I'm Wrong um what does this do
 
02:59:08.110 --> 02:59:08.120 align:start position:0%
that needed to be changed or that's an
 
02:59:10.630 --> 02:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
amendment from what you originally
 
02:59:14.269 --> 02:59:14.279 align:start position:0%
introduced um thank you for the question
 
02:59:16.550 --> 02:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
um so this is an amendment to not my
 
02:59:18.910 --> 02:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
bill right this is not the bill is not
 
02:59:23.429 --> 02:59:23.439 align:start position:0%
mine uh the amendment um has language
 
02:59:27.670 --> 02:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
from my bill which is um HB
 
02:59:31.269 --> 02:59:31.279 align:start position:0%
1708 and the only difference between
 
02:59:35.150 --> 02:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
this amendment and my original bill was
 
02:59:38.830 --> 02:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
a drafting error in OSS where the um the
 
02:59:41.229 --> 02:59:41.239 align:start position:0%
on line 11 on page two there was an
 
02:59:44.030 --> 02:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation ending in 2024 and instead
 
02:59:47.269 --> 02:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
of 2025 that is the difference in the
 
02:59:51.110 --> 02:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
language between 1708 and the language
 
02:59:54.790 --> 02:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
that you have in front of you so so just
 
02:59:57.910 --> 02:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
quick followup if I may yes of course so
 
03:00:00.550 --> 03:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
the if this amendment was was not
 
03:00:02.469 --> 03:00:02.479 align:start position:0%
adopted and and we went back to the
 
03:00:04.229 --> 03:00:04.239 align:start position:0%
original bill that that it was added on
 
03:00:07.469 --> 03:00:07.479 align:start position:0%
to um what would be the implications of
 
03:00:09.910 --> 03:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
implementing um your would it become
 
03:00:12.510 --> 03:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
completely unworkable or it would just
 
03:00:15.790 --> 03:00:15.800 align:start position:0%
have the wrong sort of hor time
 
03:00:21.150 --> 03:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
Horizon thank you for the question um I
 
03:00:23.950 --> 03:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
guess if I could asked for clarification
 
03:00:27.150 --> 03:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
the um are you supposing both
 
03:00:27.160 --> 03:00:28.590 align:start position:0%
the um are you supposing both
legislations

03:00:28.590 --> 03:00:28.600 align:start position:0%
legislations
 
03:00:31.550 --> 03:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
passed with as as you see in front of
 
03:00:33.510 --> 03:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
you because I had an amendment in
 
03:00:36.590 --> 03:00:36.600 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County to fix the the uh
 
03:00:39.030 --> 03:00:39.040 align:start position:0%

um is it not
 
03:01:02.790 --> 03:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
true that this bill for reasons
 
03:01:09.590 --> 03:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
that are not my pay grade um went to
 
03:01:12.309 --> 03:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
Municipal the substance of this
 
03:01:16.070 --> 03:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
amendment went to mun ipal and
 
03:01:19.349 --> 03:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
County a committee that has a great deal
 
03:01:19.359 --> 03:01:20.269 align:start position:0%
County a committee that has a great deal
of

03:01:20.269 --> 03:01:20.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:01:22.229 --> 03:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility and
 
03:01:25.630 --> 03:01:25.640 align:start position:0%
experience but none dealing with issues
 
03:01:28.710 --> 03:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
related to right to
 
03:01:31.870 --> 03:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
know by the time the
 
03:01:31.880 --> 03:01:33.830 align:start position:0%
know by the time the
chair

03:01:33.830 --> 03:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:01:37.229 --> 03:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
realized that that did not belong that
 
03:01:40.030 --> 03:01:40.040 align:start position:0%
bill your bill did not belong in
 
03:01:42.750 --> 03:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County the chair had
 
03:01:45.349 --> 03:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
already scheduled a hearing and
 
03:01:49.190 --> 03:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
therefore the rules of the
 
03:01:54.309 --> 03:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
house required that the bill be acted on
 
03:01:57.110 --> 03:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
there it was too late for them to pick
 
03:02:00.670 --> 03:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
up the phone and say to the chair of
 
03:02:04.469 --> 03:02:04.479 align:start position:0%
Judiciary this is your court not ours
 
03:02:04.479 --> 03:02:06.030 align:start position:0%
Judiciary this is your court not ours
and

03:02:06.030 --> 03:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:02:08.750 --> 03:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
therefore the way to resolve that
 
03:02:11.469 --> 03:02:11.479 align:start position:0%
problem and to get this language before
 
03:02:13.910 --> 03:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
a committee that is familiar with to
 
03:02:16.190 --> 03:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
know that is dealing with these issues
 
03:02:17.389 --> 03:02:17.399 align:start position:0%
in other
 
03:02:21.590 --> 03:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
bills the decision was made to propose a
 
03:02:24.670 --> 03:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
non- gerine Amendment which in effect is
 
03:02:27.670 --> 03:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
your bill with a correction of the date
 
03:02:30.590 --> 03:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
for it to be attached
 
03:02:35.990 --> 03:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
to a bill already before this committee
 
03:02:39.950 --> 03:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
and that's how this poor little bill
 
03:02:42.950 --> 03:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
made its way from Municipal and County
 
03:02:45.790 --> 03:02:45.800 align:start position:0%
down the Hall to Judiciary is that a
 
03:02:48.870 --> 03:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
correct summation of how we got here
 
03:02:53.229 --> 03:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
today um that is a very very uh good
 
03:02:55.790 --> 03:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
summation yes there there are some
 
03:02:59.150 --> 03:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
language in here that um do historically
 
03:03:00.830 --> 03:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
go to Municipal and County like the
 
03:03:05.229 --> 03:03:05.239 align:start position:0%
records retention but that is really in
 
03:03:08.510 --> 03:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
service of the 91a kind of issue and
 
03:03:10.389 --> 03:03:10.399 align:start position:0%
this is more of a 91a issue than a
 
03:03:13.110 --> 03:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
records retention or or even a uh you
 
03:03:15.670 --> 03:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
know an estate archivist kind of bill so
 
03:03:17.389 --> 03:03:17.399 align:start position:0%
yes I do believe that this is the
 
03:03:19.830 --> 03:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
correct committee for this Bill thank
 
03:03:23.070 --> 03:03:23.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I don't know if that helps
 
03:03:26.870 --> 03:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
um our colleague or not
 
03:03:30.870 --> 03:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
but if it doesn't then he should proceed
 
03:03:34.590 --> 03:03:34.600 align:start position:0%
and if not I do have a question to ask
 
03:03:36.630 --> 03:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
sure and you know so you know and maybe
 
03:03:38.190 --> 03:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
if I could just add as F forther
 
03:03:41.950 --> 03:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
clarification I think I mean
 
03:03:45.190 --> 03:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
this the way this amendment is was
 
03:03:48.870 --> 03:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
proposed it it completely replaces
 
03:03:48.880 --> 03:03:51.389 align:start position:0%
proposed it it completely replaces
1696

03:03:51.389 --> 03:03:51.399 align:start position:0%
1696
 
03:03:57.070 --> 03:03:57.080 align:start position:0%
if if there was if there was a if if
 
03:04:00.190 --> 03:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
you preferred 169 I mean if you
 
03:04:04.070 --> 03:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
preferred 1696 other than as I had
 
03:04:05.870 --> 03:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
proposed in another amendment to combine
 
03:04:07.910 --> 03:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
it with 1069 there would be nothing that
 
03:04:11.070 --> 03:04:11.080 align:start position:0%
would prevent us
 
03:04:14.710 --> 03:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
from from from keeping
 
03:04:18.670 --> 03:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
1696 as it originally was and I guess
 
03:04:20.429 --> 03:04:20.439 align:start position:0%
we'd have to prepare another amendment
 
03:04:23.550 --> 03:04:23.560 align:start position:0%
to make this a you know another section
 
03:04:25.510 --> 03:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
of that but we could do that I don't
 
03:04:29.349 --> 03:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:32.590 --> 03:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
prohibitive yes representative Kat or
 
03:04:34.030 --> 03:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry did you want to can I just
 
03:04:35.990 --> 03:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
clarify that because I feel like so if
 
03:04:37.510 --> 03:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
we could take the
 
03:04:40.670 --> 03:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
nment as it is and then we could add the
 
03:04:43.630 --> 03:04:43.640 align:start position:0%
existing HB 1696 which is one one
 
03:04:45.510 --> 03:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
section that just says nothing in this
 
03:04:47.389 --> 03:04:47.399 align:start position:0%
section shall prevent the public body or
 
03:04:49.670 --> 03:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
agency from accepting a governmental
 
03:04:51.630 --> 03:04:51.640 align:start position:0%
record request by electronic means or
 
03:04:53.389 --> 03:04:53.399 align:start position:0%
from providing such records
 
03:04:55.229 --> 03:04:55.239 align:start position:0%
electronically without requiring the
 
03:04:56.550 --> 03:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
physical appearance of the citizen
 
03:04:58.590 --> 03:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
making the request so that sentence
 
03:04:59.870 --> 03:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
could just be
 
03:05:03.550 --> 03:05:03.560 align:start position:0%
added to the bottom of this non-gain
 
03:05:05.190 --> 03:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
amendment is that
 
03:05:07.469 --> 03:05:07.479 align:start position:0%
correct sure I think we can I mean I
 
03:05:11.309 --> 03:05:11.319 align:start position:0%
think we can I think we can sort of yeah
 
03:05:14.469 --> 03:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
I think we can do that for sure okay
 
03:05:17.150 --> 03:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
that would make me more comfortable just
 
03:05:19.550 --> 03:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
because I feel like this the original
 
03:05:22.590 --> 03:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
1696 has Merit and it's separate from
 
03:05:24.389 --> 03:05:24.399 align:start position:0%
the thing that it might otherwise get
 
03:05:24.399 --> 03:05:25.349 align:start position:0%
the thing that it might otherwise get
combined

03:05:25.349 --> 03:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
combined
 
03:05:25.359 --> 03:05:27.910 align:start position:0%
combined
with

03:05:27.910 --> 03:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:05:30.950 --> 03:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
okay sure so I mean I think the I guess
 
03:05:32.389 --> 03:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
to I think the answer to that question
 
03:05:35.389 --> 03:05:35.399 align:start position:0%
is we could we can do that I you know we
 
03:05:36.830 --> 03:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
and we certainly can discuss that when
 
03:05:40.269 --> 03:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
we exact when we exact this this when we
 
03:05:43.990 --> 03:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
exact 1696 and 1069 um we can certainly
 
03:05:46.830 --> 03:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
you know if that's the way that the
 
03:05:47.990 --> 03:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
committee feels we should go we can
 
03:05:52.990 --> 03:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
certainly do that other questions for um
 
03:05:55.309 --> 03:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
could in just in response to your
 
03:05:55.319 --> 03:05:56.550 align:start position:0%
could in just in response to your
comment

03:05:56.550 --> 03:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
comment
 
03:06:00.870 --> 03:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
um because it does not appear that the
 
03:06:04.510 --> 03:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
chair is planning to have a work session
 
03:06:08.190 --> 03:06:08.200 align:start position:0%
on this but instead seems to you know
 
03:06:10.190 --> 03:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
see us moving towards an executive
 
03:06:14.990 --> 03:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
session that would require in advance of
 
03:06:18.229 --> 03:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
the executive session
 
03:06:20.830 --> 03:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
that an amendment that someone else
 
03:06:22.790 --> 03:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
might think it
 
03:06:25.910 --> 03:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh to prepare before in fact
 
03:06:25.920 --> 03:06:27.150 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh to prepare before in fact
we

03:06:27.150 --> 03:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:06:30.630 --> 03:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
vote sure no that's ex that's so that
 
03:06:33.469 --> 03:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
would have to happen um I have a
 
03:06:36.389 --> 03:06:36.399 align:start position:0%
slightly different concern and it might
 
03:06:38.950 --> 03:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
just be because I'm sitting here and I'm
 
03:06:41.990 --> 03:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
not sitting on Municipal and County and
 
03:06:45.389 --> 03:06:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:49.269 --> 03:06:49.279 align:start position:0%
happens in what I hope is going to be
 
03:06:52.429 --> 03:06:52.439 align:start position:0%
less and less of a
 
03:07:00.030 --> 03:07:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:02.309 --> 03:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
municipality does
 
03:07:02.319 --> 03:07:04.110 align:start position:0%
municipality does
not

03:07:04.110 --> 03:07:04.120 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:07:07.389 --> 03:07:07.399 align:start position:0%
welcome the opportunity to
 
03:07:12.110 --> 03:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
share its work with the public is there
 
03:07:16.910 --> 03:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
anything in this bill or an
 
03:07:23.510 --> 03:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:26.190 --> 03:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
require communities
 
03:07:32.070 --> 03:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:35.389 --> 03:07:35.399 align:start position:0%
available thank you for the question um
 
03:07:38.670 --> 03:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
in working with nhma I'm sure that they
 
03:07:40.830 --> 03:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
would be hesitant to require any
 
03:07:44.030 --> 03:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
municipality to be part of
 
03:07:48.830 --> 03:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh to to be a part of this uh I I
 
03:07:51.790 --> 03:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
drafted it to be completely voluntary
 
03:07:56.030 --> 03:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
obviously um if they do not wish it to
 
03:07:58.309 --> 03:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
be accessible on the website they're
 
03:08:00.950 --> 03:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
still required to be accessible under
 
03:08:06.309 --> 03:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
91a the traditional way and so um I
 
03:08:11.269 --> 03:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
do think that that there still will be
 
03:08:14.349 --> 03:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
accessibility and I do believe that with
 
03:08:18.030 --> 03:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
the um the records manager and nhma um
 
03:08:21.469 --> 03:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
being able to help advertise this in
 
03:08:24.389 --> 03:08:24.399 align:start position:0%
their training courses which I believe
 
03:08:28.070 --> 03:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
that they you know they will be happy to
 
03:08:30.429 --> 03:08:30.439 align:start position:0%
do as far as this being a good option
 
03:08:32.150 --> 03:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
for municipalities especially when
 
03:08:34.309 --> 03:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
you're talking about uh you know case
 
03:08:36.870 --> 03:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
studies of municipalities having to
 
03:08:38.630 --> 03:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
fulfill right to no requests that cost
 
03:08:38.640 --> 03:08:39.429 align:start position:0%
fulfill right to no requests that cost
them

03:08:39.429 --> 03:08:39.439 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:08:43.070 --> 03:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
$60,000 or something like that they
 
03:08:45.150 --> 03:08:45.160 align:start position:0%
having that liability kind of hang over
 
03:08:48.429 --> 03:08:48.439 align:start position:0%
their head will be uh incentive enough
 
03:08:51.950 --> 03:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
but I think it uh a mandate from from
 
03:08:55.030 --> 03:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
this uh to to utilize this at this time
 
03:08:57.510 --> 03:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
is probably premature until it's been
 
03:08:59.190 --> 03:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
you know off the ground and been working
 
03:09:01.830 --> 03:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
for a long time and when we see the the
 
03:09:04.590 --> 03:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
benefits of it could you provide for the
 
03:09:07.870 --> 03:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
committee the case study that documents
 
03:09:10.950 --> 03:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
the costs that you just alluded
 
03:09:16.269 --> 03:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
to um you don't have answer I just I I I
 
03:09:19.469 --> 03:09:19.479 align:start position:0%
I I've made my point Thank you thank
 
03:09:22.710 --> 03:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
you other questions for this witness
 
03:09:24.110 --> 03:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
03:09:25.950 --> 03:09:25.960 align:start position:0%

chair I was planning on speaking but um
 
03:09:32.870 --> 03:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
you know the video I'm just a bill went
 
03:09:34.990 --> 03:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
through my head about the process of the
 
03:09:37.229 --> 03:09:37.239 align:start position:0%
bill from fourth grade and representive
 
03:09:38.950 --> 03:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
Smith did such she's been around a lot
 
03:09:40.349 --> 03:09:40.359 align:start position:0%
longer than me and she did such a great
 
03:09:43.110 --> 03:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
job explaining the way this happened end
 
03:09:44.309 --> 03:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
up in this committee so I'm all set
 
03:09:47.110 --> 03:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you great thank you then I'm going
 
03:09:49.790 --> 03:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
to call next on natch Grace please from
 
03:09:55.190 --> 03:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:58.309 --> 03:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
Association thank you Mr chair n Grace
 
03:09:59.550 --> 03:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Municipal
 
03:10:02.110 --> 03:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
Association we do support this
 
03:10:03.950 --> 03:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
legislation um this non Germain
 
03:10:06.870 --> 03:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment as it is um I want to first
 
03:10:08.870 --> 03:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank the sponsor for his multi-year
 
03:10:10.990 --> 03:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
partnership with us and obviously now
 
03:10:13.269 --> 03:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office to work on
 
03:10:14.710 --> 03:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh increasing accessibility and
 
03:10:16.990 --> 03:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
availability of public
 
03:10:19.110 --> 03:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
records um I think that's bring a very
 
03:10:21.790 --> 03:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
fruitful uh fruitful relationship and I
 
03:10:24.269 --> 03:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
hope that that continues in the future
 
03:10:26.950 --> 03:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
um in this particular Bill we're trying
 
03:10:29.870 --> 03:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
something new um and what we're trying
 
03:10:31.630 --> 03:10:31.640 align:start position:0%
new is we're funding a state position
 
03:10:35.070 --> 03:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
that already exists the um and that
 
03:10:38.750 --> 03:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
position will both be in charge of
 
03:10:43.309 --> 03:10:43.319 align:start position:0%
creating this um this uh Records
 
03:10:46.349 --> 03:10:46.359 align:start position:0%
repository um which is basically a a
 
03:10:48.269 --> 03:10:48.279 align:start position:0%
slightly more boring version of Netflix
 
03:10:52.830 --> 03:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
for municipal records um and uh and also
 
03:10:55.150 --> 03:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
assist municipalities with figuring out
 
03:10:58.790 --> 03:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
how to best uh use that repository to
 
03:11:00.710 --> 03:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
help everyone um have greater
 
03:11:03.150 --> 03:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
accessibility for records as part of
 
03:11:05.469 --> 03:11:05.479 align:start position:0%
this conversation of course everyone was
 
03:11:06.750 --> 03:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about not only the
 
03:11:08.429 --> 03:11:08.439 align:start position:0%
accessibility of Records but also the
 
03:11:11.469 --> 03:11:11.479 align:start position:0%
security of those records um recognizing
 
03:11:13.750 --> 03:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
that the bill provides that if a
 
03:11:17.670 --> 03:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
municipality does use um this option and
 
03:11:20.870 --> 03:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
does provide some sort of access at the
 
03:11:24.510 --> 03:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
local level um for citizens to access
 
03:11:26.750 --> 03:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
those records whether that's through the
 
03:11:28.309 --> 03:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
library a terminal at the library a
 
03:11:31.710 --> 03:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
terminal at um Town Hall we want to make
 
03:11:35.150 --> 03:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
sure that uh that if that's that's
 
03:11:36.670 --> 03:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
occurring and therefore they're allowed
 
03:11:40.590 --> 03:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
to um destroy the original records as is
 
03:11:43.750 --> 03:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
already allowed under 33a 3A a we wanted
 
03:11:45.550 --> 03:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this was a system that
 
03:11:47.990 --> 03:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
was Secure that we had faith in um and
 
03:11:49.309 --> 03:11:49.319 align:start position:0%
we believe the Secretary of State's
 
03:11:52.469 --> 03:11:52.479 align:start position:0%
office can provide that um as uh
 
03:11:55.630 --> 03:11:55.640 align:start position:0%
representative yella mentioned it is our
 
03:11:58.990 --> 03:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
first foray into doing this um it's
 
03:12:01.150 --> 03:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
going to take some time um and some
 
03:12:02.870 --> 03:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
effort for the Secretary of State's
 
03:12:05.349 --> 03:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
office to set it up to make it work well
 
03:12:08.389 --> 03:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
and to work with municipalities to uh to
 
03:12:13.030 --> 03:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
start um providing opportunities to uh
 
03:12:15.830 --> 03:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
upload records in this manner I imagine
 
03:12:17.790 --> 03:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
that probably the ones that will opt in
 
03:12:20.190 --> 03:12:20.200 align:start position:0%
will do something fairly simple like
 
03:12:22.710 --> 03:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
meeting minutes because everybody has
 
03:12:24.229 --> 03:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
meetings they all have meeting minutes
 
03:12:27.150 --> 03:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
they comply with the law now and they're
 
03:12:29.990 --> 03:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
used to that type of system and then
 
03:12:32.349 --> 03:12:32.359 align:start position:0%
obviously for municipalities like
 
03:12:36.110 --> 03:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
Fremont that have a large portion of
 
03:12:38.870 --> 03:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
their oldo records digitized through one
 
03:12:40.830 --> 03:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
way or another or looking at that in
 
03:12:42.950 --> 03:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
order to free up storage space uh in
 
03:12:46.349 --> 03:12:46.359 align:start position:0%
town hall or or where have you um
 
03:12:47.510 --> 03:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
obviously we're trying to make this as
 
03:12:49.710 --> 03:12:49.720 align:start position:0%
easy as possible as userfriendly as
 
03:12:52.190 --> 03:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
possible and there are a lot of small
 
03:12:54.150 --> 03:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
small questions out there that have to
 
03:12:56.150 --> 03:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
be answered with kind of the software
 
03:12:57.710 --> 03:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
development and how exactly that's going
 
03:13:02.150 --> 03:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
to work um so we're asking for a little
 
03:13:04.349 --> 03:13:04.359 align:start position:0%
leeway here um
 
03:13:07.830 --> 03:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
to perform this perform this experiment
 
03:13:09.150 --> 03:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
um and we think it's going to be
 
03:13:11.590 --> 03:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
successful based on uh the many
 
03:13:13.670 --> 03:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
conversations that we had with the
 
03:13:15.630 --> 03:13:15.640 align:start position:0%
sponsor um and with the Secretary of
 
03:13:17.830 --> 03:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
State's office uh so far about how this
 
03:13:19.389 --> 03:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
may function and I'm happy to answer any
 
03:13:21.389 --> 03:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee may have
 
03:13:22.469 --> 03:13:22.479 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness
 
03:13:22.479 --> 03:13:23.750 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness
representative

03:13:23.750 --> 03:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:13:26.030 --> 03:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
Andrews thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:13:27.950 --> 03:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
03:13:31.190 --> 03:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
question you just stated this is an
 
03:13:33.309 --> 03:13:33.319 align:start position:0%
experiment you mean to tell me we're
 
03:13:36.630 --> 03:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
going to pass a bill and spend money the
 
03:13:38.790 --> 03:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
towns may put all their records on and
 
03:13:41.550 --> 03:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
it may not work and that's going to be
 
03:13:41.560 --> 03:13:44.030 align:start position:0%
it may not work and that's going to be
okay

03:13:44.030 --> 03:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:13:49.590 --> 03:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
what I mean to say is that uh no one has
 
03:13:51.910 --> 03:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
done this before in our state um this is
 
03:13:54.990 --> 03:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
this is a new area um we've had success
 
03:13:57.229 --> 03:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
over the past several years helping
 
03:13:59.030 --> 03:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities work towards greater
 
03:14:01.269 --> 03:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
digitization of Records greater
 
03:14:03.030 --> 03:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
accessibility for the general public of
 
03:14:06.349 --> 03:14:06.359 align:start position:0%
records and we think this will work as
 
03:14:10.190 --> 03:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
well follow yeah follow up okay so
 
03:14:11.790 --> 03:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
you've been working with the
 
03:14:11.800 --> 03:14:14.349 align:start position:0%
you've been working with the
municipality

03:14:14.349 --> 03:14:14.359 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
03:14:17.510 --> 03:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
in putting their records together etc
 
03:14:21.790 --> 03:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
etc so they have their records then now
 
03:14:24.269 --> 03:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
why should would they want to even
 
03:14:28.110 --> 03:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
consider taking them to the state level
 
03:14:31.309 --> 03:14:31.319 align:start position:0%
to me putting their records at the state
 
03:14:33.910 --> 03:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
level is taking away the right we're
 
03:14:36.229 --> 03:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
just making a big conglomeration up here
 
03:14:40.070 --> 03:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's my thing and I'm not happy with
 
03:14:44.389 --> 03:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
it uh well thank you for the question
 
03:14:47.190 --> 03:14:47.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm not I'm not sure I understand
 
03:14:49.229 --> 03:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
what the question was but uh I would
 
03:14:51.070 --> 03:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
refer to the
 
03:14:53.590 --> 03:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
chair no I I didn't mean to stop you
 
03:14:55.710 --> 03:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
from you know responding I just was I'm
 
03:14:58.309 --> 03:14:58.319 align:start position:0%
not I'm not sure I understood what if
 
03:14:59.670 --> 03:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
there was a question as opposed to a
 
03:15:01.190 --> 03:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
comment which the representative's
 
03:15:03.590 --> 03:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
certainly entitled to
 
03:15:05.630 --> 03:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
make I will refer to the chair's
 
03:15:08.309 --> 03:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
interpretation of this of the uh the
 
03:15:10.510 --> 03:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
words used by the
 
03:15:12.550 --> 03:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
representative other question
 
03:15:15.269 --> 03:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
representative Smith yes thank you very
 
03:15:15.279 --> 03:15:18.110 align:start position:0%
representative Smith yes thank you very
much

03:15:18.110 --> 03:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:20.670 --> 03:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm very pleased to
 
03:15:22.670 --> 03:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
hear that
 
03:15:25.070 --> 03:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
the I've been a little confused about
 
03:15:27.269 --> 03:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
pronouns I mean when you say we I'm not
 
03:15:29.590 --> 03:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
sure whether you be the state or the
 
03:15:32.110 --> 03:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
municipal Association but I know you're
 
03:15:34.429 --> 03:15:34.439 align:start position:0%
speaking to the municipal Association
 
03:15:37.590 --> 03:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm pleased to hear you talk about
 
03:15:39.389 --> 03:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
how important you think it is for people
 
03:15:43.510 --> 03:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
to have access to records and including
 
03:15:43.520 --> 03:15:45.510 align:start position:0%
to have access to records and including
um

03:15:45.510 --> 03:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:50.670 --> 03:15:50.680 align:start position:0%
electronic records I'm not sure how that
 
03:15:53.790 --> 03:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
meshes with the information that was
 
03:15:56.590 --> 03:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
presented to this committee on the two
 
03:15:58.870 --> 03:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
other bills that are somewhat in the
 
03:16:03.349 --> 03:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
same Basket in which um we have copies
 
03:16:06.269 --> 03:16:06.279 align:start position:0%
for example of something that quotes the
 
03:16:09.830 --> 03:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
municipal Association saying to the town
 
03:16:15.990 --> 03:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
of new durm not Durham but new durm that
 
03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:18.429 align:start position:0%
of new durm not Durham but new durm that
um

03:16:18.429 --> 03:16:18.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:18.439 --> 03:16:20.910 align:start position:0%
um
paper

03:16:20.910 --> 03:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
paper
 
03:16:23.790 --> 03:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
copies can be required and can be
 
03:16:26.070 --> 03:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
charged for at at certain rates I'm not
 
03:16:29.469 --> 03:16:29.479 align:start position:0%
quoting I don't have it in front of me
 
03:16:32.990 --> 03:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
but I guess I need to know if it is in
 
03:16:38.150 --> 03:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
fact a statement of Municipal of um the
 
03:16:43.189 --> 03:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
organization's policy of encouraging
 
03:16:45.269 --> 03:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
all the municipalities that do all the
 
03:16:47.550 --> 03:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities Belong by the way yes
 
03:16:49.630 --> 03:16:49.640 align:start position:0%
they do ma'am okay um I thought so but I
 
03:16:52.070 --> 03:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
just wanted to check that to encourage
 
03:16:56.389 --> 03:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
them to move to electronic
 
03:16:58.469 --> 03:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping well it seems to me that
 
03:17:00.030 --> 03:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
the policy of the legislature has been
 
03:17:02.229 --> 03:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
to encourage electronic recordkeeping
 
03:17:04.349 --> 03:17:04.359 align:start position:0%
for instance there have been recent
 
03:17:06.710 --> 03:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
Provisions passed about um posting
 
03:17:10.710 --> 03:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
meeting minutes on the website um about
 
03:17:12.670 --> 03:17:12.680 align:start position:0%
um other Provisions related to to you
 
03:17:15.189 --> 03:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
know uh that type of
 
03:17:17.030 --> 03:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
accessibility um you know there was
 
03:17:19.110 --> 03:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
certainly an unfortunate
 
03:17:21.150 --> 03:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
miscommunication uh at one of our
 
03:17:23.389 --> 03:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
trainings um that I prefer not to speak
 
03:17:26.389 --> 03:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
about um that has since been corrected
 
03:17:26.399 --> 03:17:27.510 align:start position:0%
about um that has since been corrected
um

03:17:27.510 --> 03:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:30.590 --> 03:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
but what it it it appears that is the
 
03:17:32.950 --> 03:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
general direction that the legislature
 
03:17:34.910 --> 03:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
is moving in that society's moving in is
 
03:17:38.349 --> 03:17:38.359 align:start position:0%
is this type of of Records access and
 
03:17:42.150 --> 03:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
keeping um and certainly other leg
 
03:17:44.269 --> 03:17:44.279 align:start position:0%
legislation has been discussed about
 
03:17:47.750 --> 03:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
electronic records requests um and
 
03:17:51.510 --> 03:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
everything else and so what seems to
 
03:17:55.590 --> 03:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
make sense is to try to engage with the
 
03:17:57.710 --> 03:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
uh the stakeholders and discuss with
 
03:18:01.229 --> 03:18:01.239 align:start position:0%
them about you know what we can do to
 
03:18:03.030 --> 03:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
help um promote this type of
 
03:18:04.590 --> 03:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
accessibility and I'm certainly happy to
 
03:18:06.750 --> 03:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
share our policies on on the right to
 
03:18:10.150 --> 03:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
know um bill with the committee if
 
03:18:12.469 --> 03:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
that's helpful we have a very lengthy uh
 
03:18:14.830 --> 03:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
policy on that um and it does emphasize
 
03:18:16.510 --> 03:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
the importance of of providing
 
03:18:18.269 --> 03:18:18.279 align:start position:0%
accessibility to records and continuing
 
03:18:20.550 --> 03:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
to work with stakeholders to make sure
 
03:18:23.469 --> 03:18:23.479 align:start position:0%
that those are available um as openly as
 
03:18:26.670 --> 03:18:26.680 align:start position:0%
possible so my if I just be clear then
 
03:18:28.790 --> 03:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
my you my question isn't what the
 
03:18:30.590 --> 03:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
legislature wants or what the state
 
03:18:34.870 --> 03:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
wants my question is to you representing
 
03:18:38.150 --> 03:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
so adequately the the municipal
 
03:18:40.469 --> 03:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
Association is the municipal
 
03:18:42.910 --> 03:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
association's policy
 
03:18:45.910 --> 03:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
to encourage all
 
03:18:50.670 --> 03:18:50.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities to move towards
 
03:18:53.150 --> 03:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
electronic um
 
03:18:56.990 --> 03:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping our our policies to inform
 
03:18:58.950 --> 03:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities about what the law is and
 
03:19:02.110 --> 03:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
what their options are under that and to
 
03:19:03.950 --> 03:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
provide them as much guidance as we can
 
03:19:07.630 --> 03:19:07.640 align:start position:0%
as to the direction of the uh the state
 
03:19:11.670 --> 03:19:11.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so uh I I can't help
 
03:19:15.510 --> 03:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
um I I I can't help recalling the
 
03:19:17.469 --> 03:19:17.479 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard earlier in some of
 
03:19:21.910 --> 03:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
these right to know bills in which
 
03:19:25.630 --> 03:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
um if I understand correctly some
 
03:19:29.309 --> 03:19:29.319 align:start position:0%
official maybe even the council for the
 
03:19:31.750 --> 03:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
City of Rochester thought it appropriate
 
03:19:34.429 --> 03:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
to take the position that because
 
03:19:36.870 --> 03:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
somebody who runs a newspaper in
 
03:19:40.229 --> 03:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
Rochester but lives in Maine made the
 
03:19:42.389 --> 03:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
request that person would was not
 
03:19:45.150 --> 03:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
entitled to get the records because of
 
03:19:47.550 --> 03:19:47.560 align:start position:0%
an interpret of the the the provision
 
03:19:50.309 --> 03:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
that uses the term citizen of the
 
03:19:52.030 --> 03:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the word citizen is my
 
03:19:53.830 --> 03:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
understanding of the testimony that
 
03:19:56.429 --> 03:19:56.439 align:start position:0%
strikes me as incredible I understand
 
03:20:02.070 --> 03:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
the trial court um uh rejected that
 
03:20:04.229 --> 03:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
position out of hand but now apparently
 
03:20:05.670 --> 03:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
there's been an appeal to the Supreme
 
03:20:09.790 --> 03:20:09.800 align:start position:0%
Court it it it it's that is amazing that
 
03:20:11.389 --> 03:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
somebody could take that position I have
 
03:20:12.630 --> 03:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
to say
 
03:20:15.550 --> 03:20:15.560 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to any individual position
 
03:20:17.309 --> 03:20:17.319 align:start position:0%
any of my members may
 
03:20:19.990 --> 03:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
take other questions for this
 
03:20:22.349 --> 03:20:22.359 align:start position:0%
witness representative
 
03:20:25.189 --> 03:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
Andrew thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:20:28.950 --> 03:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question do you have data
 
03:20:32.349 --> 03:20:32.359 align:start position:0%
available of how many
 
03:20:35.510 --> 03:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities have their records
 
03:20:40.309 --> 03:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
electronically already and how many do
 
03:20:42.950 --> 03:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
everything manually
 
03:20:45.309 --> 03:20:45.319 align:start position:0%
I don't have specific data on that what
 
03:20:49.870 --> 03:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
I will say is most municipalities
 
03:20:52.550 --> 03:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
have some sort of cutof date where
 
03:20:54.910 --> 03:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
they've started transitioning um for the
 
03:20:56.590 --> 03:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
larger municipalities so if they've
 
03:20:58.870 --> 03:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
started taking minutes electronically
 
03:21:00.950 --> 03:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
and posting them to the website often
 
03:21:02.429 --> 03:21:02.439 align:start position:0%
times it'll be you know they started
 
03:21:04.189 --> 03:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
doing that in 2006 or whatever
 
03:21:06.269 --> 03:21:06.279 align:start position:0%
everything before then is paper they
 
03:21:07.590 --> 03:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
haven't necessarily gone back and
 
03:21:10.229 --> 03:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
digitized those some have um it's kind
 
03:21:12.830 --> 03:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
of all over the board at the moment
 
03:21:15.229 --> 03:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
as I think follow up yeah follow follow
 
03:21:17.150 --> 03:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
up one
 
03:21:17.160 --> 03:21:19.269 align:start position:0%
up one
more

03:21:19.269 --> 03:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:21:22.990 --> 03:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
um when a municipality if this went
 
03:21:25.630 --> 03:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
through and they went on to the
 
03:21:30.229 --> 03:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
state for their records how far back is
 
03:21:33.150 --> 03:21:33.160 align:start position:0%
a m municipality going to go I mean they
 
03:21:35.790 --> 03:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
may have been in existence for two two
 
03:21:38.510 --> 03:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
300 years and they may have records in
 
03:21:40.630 --> 03:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
their boxes are they going to have to
 
03:21:43.750 --> 03:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
put all that anding Bring It
 
03:21:48.429 --> 03:21:48.439 align:start position:0%
Forward um so the obviously they have to
 
03:21:51.710 --> 03:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
still comply with the provisions of 33
 
03:21:54.830 --> 03:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
a3a for what has to be kept as paper
 
03:21:57.349 --> 03:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
regardless whether you digitize it um
 
03:21:59.269 --> 03:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
but honestly I think that question is
 
03:22:01.550 --> 03:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
better for representative yella because
 
03:22:03.389 --> 03:22:03.399 align:start position:0%
I believe he's been one of the most
 
03:22:06.510 --> 03:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
zealous individuals in terms of scanning
 
03:22:08.189 --> 03:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
and digitizing records from his
 
03:22:09.750 --> 03:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
municipality and I don't know how far
 
03:22:11.510 --> 03:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
back he has gone but I'm guessing he
 
03:22:14.150 --> 03:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
probably has the record for that well if
 
03:22:16.630 --> 03:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
you know I isn't I'm wondering is
 
03:22:17.910 --> 03:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but wouldn't the
 
03:22:19.830 --> 03:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
short answer to the question be
 
03:22:21.790 --> 03:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities wouldn't h under this
 
03:22:24.469 --> 03:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
bill wouldn't have to go back it's
 
03:22:26.429 --> 03:22:26.439 align:start position:0%
completely up to them whether it's a COR
 
03:22:28.550 --> 03:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
correct whether it's a digitize any of
 
03:22:31.150 --> 03:22:31.160 align:start position:0%
them it would be a local option um and
 
03:22:33.510 --> 03:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
that's why I would imagine that what
 
03:22:36.030 --> 03:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
you'd see first is something like you
 
03:22:38.309 --> 03:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
know any municipality opting in would
 
03:22:40.189 --> 03:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
transition first to hey we're going to
 
03:22:42.590 --> 03:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
put all of our board's minutes up there
 
03:22:44.710 --> 03:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
that seems to be working well it seems
 
03:22:46.630 --> 03:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
to be useful we're getting feedback from
 
03:22:49.229 --> 03:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
the community what do we do next and
 
03:22:51.670 --> 03:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
kind of phase in and then as they look
 
03:22:54.189 --> 03:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
to do something like uh for example the
 
03:22:55.429 --> 03:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
police department I used to work at we
 
03:22:57.630 --> 03:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
had an entire records room if we were
 
03:22:59.189 --> 03:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
able to digitize that we could use that
 
03:23:01.269 --> 03:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
for some something El that space for
 
03:23:03.990 --> 03:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
something else um so as they look to you
 
03:23:06.590 --> 03:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
know repurpose rooms or whatever the
 
03:23:09.269 --> 03:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
whatever the policy is the local level
 
03:23:11.790 --> 03:23:11.800 align:start position:0%
um that would be when you'd see them dig
 
03:23:13.309 --> 03:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
tie some of those older
 
03:23:15.950 --> 03:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
records other questions for this
 
03:23:18.870 --> 03:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
03:23:20.870 --> 03:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
Ashley Miller please from the Secretary

03:23:35.950 --> 03:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
office good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
03:23:38.030 --> 03:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
03:23:39.830 --> 03:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
Ashley Miller I'm the New Hampshire
 
03:23:41.830 --> 03:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
State archist under the Secretary of
 
03:23:44.309 --> 03:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
State's office I support this
 
03:23:46.550 --> 03:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
legislation as the Director of archives
 
03:23:48.790 --> 03:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
and Records management for the state our
 
03:23:50.790 --> 03:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
division is often sought out by
 
03:23:52.750 --> 03:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities for answers to their
 
03:23:55.510 --> 03:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
records related questions as you know
 
03:23:57.790 --> 03:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is home to over 200
 
03:23:59.630 --> 03:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities each with their own
 
03:24:02.389 --> 03:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
unique records challenges a local
 
03:24:04.110 --> 03:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
government records manager plays a
 
03:24:06.510 --> 03:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
crucial role in ensuring efficient
 
03:24:08.870 --> 03:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping this role will allow us to
 
03:24:11.189 --> 03:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
reach every municipality to promote and
 
03:24:11.199 --> 03:24:12.229 align:start position:0%
reach every municipality to promote and
implement

03:24:12.229 --> 03:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
implement
 
03:24:14.750 --> 03:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
systematic organization preserve the
 
03:24:17.309 --> 03:24:17.319 align:start position:0%
historic records they do have and train
 
03:24:19.710 --> 03:24:19.720 align:start position:0%
them on digitization and metadata
 
03:24:22.070 --> 03:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
standards this not only streamlines our
 
03:24:24.750 --> 03:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping processes Statewide but it
 
03:24:26.990 --> 03:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
allows us for quick retrieval of
 
03:24:29.070 --> 03:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
information this bill does not create
 
03:24:30.910 --> 03:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
any new positions within the Secretary
 
03:24:33.269 --> 03:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
of State's office but it does fund a
 
03:24:35.110 --> 03:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
current position a position that's
 
03:24:37.790 --> 03:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
currently unfunded with the funding of
 
03:24:39.590 --> 03:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
this position we can better serve all of
 
03:24:41.790 --> 03:24:41.800 align:start position:0%
our municipalities by providing in
 
03:24:44.830 --> 03:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
Outreach training best practices and a
 
03:24:46.750 --> 03:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
convenient digital repository where
 
03:24:48.830 --> 03:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
their records can be both preserved and
 
03:24:51.469 --> 03:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
accessible to the public archives are
 
03:24:54.030 --> 03:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
arsenals of accountability we strive to
 
03:24:55.750 --> 03:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
preserve the historical record to
 
03:24:57.550 --> 03:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
promote government
 
03:25:00.150 --> 03:25:00.160 align:start position:0%
transparency increased access to records
 
03:25:01.950 --> 03:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
for the public allows citizens to
 
03:25:03.910 --> 03:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
monitor government activities and
 
03:25:05.830 --> 03:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
exercise their rights as informed
 
03:25:07.550 --> 03:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
participants in the
 
03:25:09.910 --> 03:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
Democracy archives play a pivotal role
 
03:25:12.309 --> 03:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
in cultivating and informed citiz R
 
03:25:13.830 --> 03:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
which is essential for the functioning
 
03:25:16.510 --> 03:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
of a healthy democracy this bill is a
 
03:25:19.510 --> 03:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
step toward access thank you to the
 
03:25:20.670 --> 03:25:20.680 align:start position:0%
committee for allowing me the
 
03:25:22.309 --> 03:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak and I'm happy to

know how many of our
 
03:25:40.110 --> 03:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities comply with the law and
 
03:25:45.670 --> 03:25:45.680 align:start position:0%

who reach out to me every day in terms
 
03:25:55.830 --> 03:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
of their records related questions
 
03:25:57.670 --> 03:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
whether it's retention whether it's
 
03:26:00.990 --> 03:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
access whether it's preservation but but

that will be here a little bit later
 
04:03:44.590 --> 04:03:44.600 align:start position:0%
will probably be falling asleep during
 
04:03:47.429 --> 04:03:47.439 align:start position:0%
the the after this is the worst slot to
 
04:03:50.510 --> 04:03:50.520 align:start position:0%

after lunch so I I appreciate your time
 
04:03:55.630 --> 04:03:55.640 align:start position:0%
and if your eyelids are still open when
 
04:03:58.790 --> 04:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
I'm done God bless
 
04:04:03.189 --> 04:04:03.199 align:start position:0%
you so the bill that is before you is
 
04:04:06.990 --> 04:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
designed to try to get ahead of if it's
 
04:04:09.229 --> 04:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
even possible now
 
04:04:11.630 --> 04:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
advancements in technology in the area
 
04:04:14.950 --> 04:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
of artificial intelligence artificial
 
04:04:18.750 --> 04:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
intelligence uh is not uh somebody who's
 
04:04:21.349 --> 04:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
not as smart as they appear such as
 
04:04:24.990 --> 04:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
me uh artificial intelligence is is a
 
04:04:29.189 --> 04:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
development in computer uh
 
04:04:33.550 --> 04:04:33.560 align:start position:0%
technology it is uh taken Mega leaps
 
04:04:36.070 --> 04:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
over the last few years be it Computing
 
04:04:39.830 --> 04:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
speed and capacity
 
04:04:43.429 --> 04:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
and it is branching out into areas of of
 
04:04:47.590 --> 04:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
video and audio robotics uh they're
 
04:04:51.189 --> 04:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
literally talking about AI replacing
 
04:04:53.990 --> 04:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
people in numerous
 
04:04:56.590 --> 04:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
Industries because it has the capacity
 
04:05:00.630 --> 04:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
or the capability of
 
04:05:04.269 --> 04:05:04.279 align:start position:0%
selflearning um it can uh if it's
 
04:05:07.389 --> 04:05:07.399 align:start position:0%
designed there are several uh different
 
04:05:10.389 --> 04:05:10.399 align:start position:0%
program or or applications out there
 
04:05:12.389 --> 04:05:12.399 align:start position:0%
that are being test driven for different
 
04:05:13.710 --> 04:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
uh different
 
04:05:16.349 --> 04:05:16.359 align:start position:0%
reasons but one of the things that one
 
04:05:18.870 --> 04:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
area where AI has been in use for quite
 
04:05:21.750 --> 04:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
some time and is is becoming very
 
04:05:25.070 --> 04:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
dangerous is in video and audio and
 
04:05:28.229 --> 04:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
they're called Deep fakes I can take
 
04:05:29.630 --> 04:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
your likeness and this has been around
 
04:05:31.590 --> 04:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
for for for several years now much more
 
04:05:35.110 --> 04:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
than audio but I can take your likeness
 
04:05:40.269 --> 04:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
and produce a video showing you doing
 
04:05:42.710 --> 04:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
something whatever it may be it could
 
04:05:42.720 --> 04:05:43.469 align:start position:0%
something whatever it may be it could
just

04:05:43.469 --> 04:05:43.479 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:05:47.630 --> 04:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
be something silly and innocent to
 
04:05:50.309 --> 04:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
something quite devious or
 
04:05:53.149 --> 04:05:53.159 align:start position:0%
illegal it's not you actually doing it
 
04:05:54.910 --> 04:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
but it is an image of you that I've
 
04:05:57.229 --> 04:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
created using a computer program or this
 
04:05:57.239 --> 04:05:59.950 align:start position:0%
created using a computer program or this
artificial

04:05:59.950 --> 04:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:02.389 --> 04:06:02.399 align:start position:0%
intelligence but I can also take your
 
04:06:05.030 --> 04:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
voice and all I need is 3 seconds of
 
04:06:08.830 --> 04:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
your actual voice and now I I can
 
04:06:12.229 --> 04:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
replicate that to make you say anything
 
04:06:15.670 --> 04:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
I want you to say though you didn't say
 
04:06:19.229 --> 04:06:19.239 align:start position:0%
it and it becomes dangerous when for
 
04:06:22.870 --> 04:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
example I take an image of say my high
 
04:06:22.880 --> 04:06:24.469 align:start position:0%
example I take an image of say my high
school

04:06:24.469 --> 04:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:06:28.229 --> 04:06:28.239 align:start position:0%
classmate make her naked doing something
 
04:06:30.630 --> 04:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
that would be embarrassing and then I
 
04:06:32.349 --> 04:06:32.359 align:start position:0%
put that on the web or share that on
 
04:06:34.670 --> 04:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
social media or something like that and
 
04:06:36.349 --> 04:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
those kinds of incidents have already
 
04:06:38.550 --> 04:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
started to happen
 
04:06:41.870 --> 04:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
the girls didn't do what these videos
 
04:06:44.630 --> 04:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
showed them doing but because their
 
04:06:46.389 --> 04:06:46.399 align:start position:0%
likeness was used and using a program
 
04:06:47.590 --> 04:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
there are programs that can just take a
 
04:06:50.750 --> 04:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
still image of anybody and they call it
 
04:06:54.149 --> 04:06:54.159 align:start position:0%
nud toying just take a photo of you and
 
04:06:56.030 --> 04:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
now at the artificial intelligence the
 
04:06:58.630 --> 04:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
program can take off all your clothes
 
04:07:01.429 --> 04:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
and show what you would look like
 
04:07:03.790 --> 04:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
naked that would be embarrassing enough
 
04:07:05.990 --> 04:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
but what if I could now take your image
 
04:07:08.229 --> 04:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
or your likeness and show you
 
04:07:12.870 --> 04:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:15.990 --> 04:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
crime it's not just an embarrassing
 
04:07:18.550 --> 04:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
thing it is now you conducting a
 
04:07:22.950 --> 04:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
criminal a behavior but that wasn't you
 
04:07:24.830 --> 04:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
now you're stuck having to prove your
 
04:07:27.149 --> 04:07:27.159 align:start position:0%
innocence instead of proving your guilt
 
04:07:29.349 --> 04:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
everyone's going to see that video that
 
04:07:31.429 --> 04:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
lie will get out around the world and
 
04:07:33.790 --> 04:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
embarrass you and shock you maybe it
 
04:07:35.630 --> 04:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
might cause you to be arrested and
 
04:07:37.790 --> 04:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
thrown in jail prosecuted in some
 
04:07:40.510 --> 04:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
capacity for something you did not
 
04:07:43.070 --> 04:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
do but by the time that the truth gets
 
04:07:45.309 --> 04:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
out you're already you're already
 
04:07:48.269 --> 04:07:48.279 align:start position:0%
hindered from being able to maybe uh
 
04:07:50.510 --> 04:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
make a living or something like that and
 
04:07:54.349 --> 04:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
so what this bill is attempting to do is
 
04:07:59.389 --> 04:07:59.399 align:start position:0%
to penalize or or to to to to prohibit
 
04:08:01.590 --> 04:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
the use of this AI
 
04:08:04.670 --> 04:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
technology for the purpose of harming
 
04:08:09.950 --> 04:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:13.630 --> 04:08:13.640 align:start position:0%
whether that harm is reputational harm
 
04:08:15.349 --> 04:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
because even reputational harm can cause
 
04:08:17.750 --> 04:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
you to lose if they say you're a
 
04:08:20.429 --> 04:08:20.439 align:start position:0%
physician and now you lose patience
 
04:08:24.349 --> 04:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
because they see this AI generated video
 
04:08:27.109 --> 04:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
of you or audio of you doing something
 
04:08:28.429 --> 04:08:28.439 align:start position:0%
that now now you're going to lose
 
04:08:30.070 --> 04:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
customers or you're a contractor or
 
04:08:31.670 --> 04:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
you're an attorney or maybe you're
 
04:08:33.830 --> 04:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
running for reelection and your
 
04:08:35.349 --> 04:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
opponents decide that they're going to
 
04:08:37.269 --> 04:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
put something together and show you
 
04:08:38.830 --> 04:08:38.840 align:start position:0%
doing something you didn't do now you're
 
04:08:40.870 --> 04:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
not going to get elected because of that
 
04:08:44.590 --> 04:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
now $200 a year or $200 $100 a year
 
04:08:47.109 --> 04:08:47.119 align:start position:0%
salary isn't much to to sneeze about
 
04:08:49.309 --> 04:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
here but you all have reputations and
 
04:08:51.309 --> 04:08:51.319 align:start position:0%
you'd like to keep your reputation but
 
04:08:52.950 --> 04:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
if somebody comes along and sulles your
 
04:08:55.910 --> 04:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
reputation through a lie through a deep
 
04:08:58.309 --> 04:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
fake well that person should be should
 
04:09:00.189 --> 04:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
be punished for doing that that should
 
04:09:02.229 --> 04:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
not be tolerated and no it's not just
 
04:09:03.910 --> 04:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
well that's just politics for you no
 
04:09:07.030 --> 04:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
that person is seeking to damage you in
 
04:09:08.109 --> 04:09:08.119 align:start position:0%
some Capac
 
04:09:11.990 --> 04:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
capacity and so this this bill seeks to
 
04:09:15.550 --> 04:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
create a penalty for the use of these
 
04:09:18.630 --> 04:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
deep fakes in harming somebody
 
04:09:21.630 --> 04:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
reputationally financially or in in an
 
04:09:23.630 --> 04:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
attempt to entrap them in some kind of a
 
04:09:25.790 --> 04:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
crime to get them arrested or prosecuted
 
04:09:28.630 --> 04:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
in some way and then also a private
 
04:09:30.149 --> 04:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
right of action where there may not have
 
04:09:33.189 --> 04:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
been a criminal act done they didn't uh
 
04:09:34.950 --> 04:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
film you committing a crime or or they
 
04:09:36.710 --> 04:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
didn't create a video showing you
 
04:09:38.950 --> 04:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
committing a crime but it was something
 
04:09:40.269 --> 04:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
uh and and it was just brought to my
 
04:09:42.510 --> 04:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
attention this morning walking in uh
 
04:09:46.389 --> 04:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
even billionaire pop stars are uh uh are
 
04:09:48.590 --> 04:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
subject to these deep fakes I guess
 
04:09:51.469 --> 04:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
Taylor Swift there was a video of her
 
04:09:53.149 --> 04:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
which wasn't actually her but somebody
 
04:09:55.990 --> 04:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
created a deep fake showing Taylor Swift
 
04:09:58.950 --> 04:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
in provocatively a new a porn
 
04:10:00.910 --> 04:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
pornographic video or something along
 
04:10:03.510 --> 04:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
those lines and so uh you know that's
 
04:10:05.550 --> 04:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
not something that some even a pop star
 
04:10:07.750 --> 04:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
should have to shake it off that is
 
04:10:09.189 --> 04:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
something that you and I have to deal
 
04:10:11.429 --> 04:10:11.439 align:start position:0%
with going forward are we going to wait
 
04:10:13.149 --> 04:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
until there's a trail of bodies before
 
04:10:15.630 --> 04:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
we address it or are we going to get out
 
04:10:17.510 --> 04:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
ahead of it and say no we're not going
 
04:10:20.910 --> 04:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
to allow the use of AI for those
 
04:10:23.149 --> 04:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
purposes there will be a cost to it and
 
04:10:24.750 --> 04:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
so the private right of action would
 
04:10:27.229 --> 04:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
allow Miss Swift to find out who did
 
04:10:29.030 --> 04:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
that and go after them in that regard
 
04:10:30.630 --> 04:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
because the the making of pornographic
 
04:10:32.750 --> 04:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
images is not
 
04:10:34.670 --> 04:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
illegal but if you're creating a
 
04:10:36.750 --> 04:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
reputational harm and it's not actually
 
04:10:39.790 --> 04:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
her then she can go after you for doing
 
04:10:42.790 --> 04:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
it so that's what this bill does uh and
 
04:10:46.070 --> 04:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
it it protects everybody because lying
 
04:10:47.950 --> 04:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
about somebody and doing reputational
 
04:10:51.269 --> 04:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
harm to somebody is not free
 
04:10:54.229 --> 04:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
speech that's all I have questions for
 
04:10:56.630 --> 04:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
this witness representative Perez thank
 
04:10:59.349 --> 04:10:59.359 align:start position:0%
you thanks for taking my question I find
 
04:11:01.109 --> 04:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
this very interesting that you bringing
 
04:11:03.030 --> 04:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
this forward and I appreciate you
 
04:11:05.550 --> 04:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
bringing it Forward because being a Law
 
04:11:07.870 --> 04:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
and Order fan or
 
04:11:11.469 --> 04:11:11.479 align:start position:0%
fan I just watched a program La last
 
04:11:14.389 --> 04:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
week where they Ed this
 
04:11:18.469 --> 04:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
technology to literally convict a man
 
04:11:21.149 --> 04:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
for a crime that he did not commit they
 
04:11:23.670 --> 04:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
use the technology and they kept saying
 
04:11:25.109 --> 04:11:25.119 align:start position:0%
well he was left-handed but you're
 
04:11:27.590 --> 04:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
showing him shooting with his right hand
 
04:11:30.670 --> 04:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
they there was no way to prove that it
 
04:11:32.990 --> 04:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't him so I appreciate this coming
 
04:11:35.630 --> 04:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
forward because I immediately had the
 
04:11:38.590 --> 04:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
discussion of what's to stop that to
 
04:11:39.630 --> 04:11:39.640 align:start position:0%
happen to
 
04:11:41.910 --> 04:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
anybody um
 
04:11:45.189 --> 04:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
so I think the the charges or the
 
04:11:49.309 --> 04:11:49.319 align:start position:0%
amounts or the penalties that you have
 
04:11:51.990 --> 04:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm personally what made you
 
04:11:54.950 --> 04:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
choose them they seem very low to
 
04:11:58.070 --> 04:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
me well I
 
04:12:01.349 --> 04:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
think in in in my mind I guess
 
04:12:04.229 --> 04:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
the what what would people go for and
 
04:12:06.750 --> 04:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
what it should it be uh there are times
 
04:12:08.910 --> 04:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
when when you think a little Street
 
04:12:11.790 --> 04:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
Justice is all that is needed um and
 
04:12:13.950 --> 04:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
there was a time in our history where
 
04:12:15.229 --> 04:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
you might you
 
04:12:19.389 --> 04:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
know you you just took care of things um
 
04:12:21.309 --> 04:12:21.319 align:start position:0%
we don't live in those we don't live in
 
04:12:25.109 --> 04:12:25.119 align:start position:0%
those times anymore and
 
04:12:27.830 --> 04:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh and so I look at like if you are
 
04:12:30.429 --> 04:12:30.439 align:start position:0%
going to make an image a video of
 
04:12:32.790 --> 04:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
somebody committing a crime and the
 
04:12:35.550 --> 04:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
sentence of that crime is 10 years in
 
04:12:40.309 --> 04:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
prison the person didn't do this crime
 
04:12:42.750 --> 04:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
you made a video showing this person
 
04:12:44.870 --> 04:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
doing a crime that carries a 10year
 
04:12:47.550 --> 04:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
sentence to it so you should do the 10
 
04:12:50.070 --> 04:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
years instead now that was my thinking
 
04:12:51.349 --> 04:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
that's involved with it now whether or
 
04:12:53.429 --> 04:12:53.439 align:start position:0%
not we can make that fly I don't know if
 
04:12:54.870 --> 04:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
we need to amend the bill to say well
 
04:12:56.349 --> 04:12:56.359 align:start position:0%
you get a slap on the wrist the first
 
04:12:58.750 --> 04:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
time and three strikes and you're out
 
04:13:00.309 --> 04:13:00.319 align:start position:0%
you know that's not Justice anymore
 
04:13:02.670 --> 04:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
either and so why bother but there needs
 
04:13:05.070 --> 04:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
to be a penalty for doing this sort of
 
04:13:06.870 --> 04:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
thing because real people are going to
 
04:13:09.469 --> 04:13:09.479 align:start position:0%
get really hurt by really nefarious
 
04:13:12.870 --> 04:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
people using a very powerful weapon uh
 
04:13:14.910 --> 04:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
this is a weapon it's a tool that's the
 
04:13:16.550 --> 04:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
problem most tools are also weapons
 
04:13:18.229 --> 04:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
that's why the game of Clue has
 
04:13:20.670 --> 04:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
candlesticks ropes and pipes and not
 
04:13:23.269 --> 04:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
just shotguns and poison pills so
 
04:13:24.750 --> 04:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
everything that is a tool is also a
 
04:13:28.189 --> 04:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
weapon and so these These are it's it's
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
very dangerous technology while at the
 
04:13:32.269 --> 04:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
same time being very useful technology
 
04:13:34.870 --> 04:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
04:13:36.950 --> 04:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative Manos thank
 
04:13:39.070 --> 04:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you representative
 
04:13:41.670 --> 04:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
grien for taking my question I wanted to
 
04:13:43.990 --> 04:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
ask you about the qu the uh definition
 
04:13:47.790 --> 04:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
of deep fake and it said deep fake it
 
04:13:50.469 --> 04:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
says deep fake means audio video or
 
04:13:52.550 --> 04:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
audio that is generated with the end
 
04:13:54.990 --> 04:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
goal of portraying something that did
 
04:13:58.309 --> 04:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
not actually occur in reality correct
 
04:14:02.750 --> 04:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that that definition
 
04:14:05.830 --> 04:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
would um that the only thing that that
 
04:14:08.149 --> 04:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
it would limit it to docu mentaries that
 
04:14:09.910 --> 04:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
unless something is a
 
04:14:13.389 --> 04:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
documentary it becomes a deep fake and I
 
04:14:15.670 --> 04:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
just wondered about your reaction to
 
04:14:18.910 --> 04:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
that in order to define the terms I had
 
04:14:23.950 --> 04:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
to do a search for common definitions
 
04:14:27.510 --> 04:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
that would be recognized throughout the
 
04:14:29.750 --> 04:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
shall we say the industry or the public
 
04:14:32.189 --> 04:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
How would how would a deep fake be
 
04:14:34.710 --> 04:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
defined and so those are not original
 
04:14:37.870 --> 04:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
words with me uh that was how it just as
 
04:14:40.229 --> 04:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
the same as artificial intelligence how
 
04:14:41.550 --> 04:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
do you define what artificial
 
04:14:43.830 --> 04:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
intelligence is those are those are
 
04:14:46.109 --> 04:14:46.119 align:start position:0%
terms within the industry those people
 
04:14:48.590 --> 04:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
who are actually developing those uh the
 
04:14:50.910 --> 04:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
technology that's how they describe what
 
04:14:53.070 --> 04:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence is and so a deep
 
04:14:56.429 --> 04:14:56.439 align:start position:0%
fake the the the term is is defined what
 
04:14:58.910 --> 04:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
I have defined in there is taken from a
 
04:15:01.229 --> 04:15:01.239 align:start position:0%
a broadly accepted definition of what a
 
04:15:03.590 --> 04:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
deep fake is and the whole intent of the
 
04:15:05.510 --> 04:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
deep fake is to portray
 
04:15:08.269 --> 04:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
something that did not
 
04:15:12.349 --> 04:15:12.359 align:start position:0%
happen it's it's it's showing something
 
04:15:15.030 --> 04:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
that's it's it's a lie it's
 
04:15:19.750 --> 04:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
fiction but the the it can it can be
 
04:15:23.349 --> 04:15:23.359 align:start position:0%
though it is fiction it can be applied
 
04:15:27.030 --> 04:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
as a weapon to try to to harm somebody
 
04:15:29.109 --> 04:15:29.119 align:start position:0%
so we we know that Guardians of the
 
04:15:31.550 --> 04:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
Galaxy is a fictional
 
04:15:34.269 --> 04:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
story but if I could take something if
 
04:15:37.630 --> 04:15:37.640 align:start position:0%
if it were limited to just fantasy we
 
04:15:39.950 --> 04:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have this discussion but if I
 
04:15:41.990 --> 04:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
can make it look like you've done
 
04:15:45.269 --> 04:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
something that you didn't do that is
 
04:15:47.910 --> 04:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
called a deep fake there are there are
 
04:15:49.830 --> 04:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
images I I could take I could take your
 
04:15:52.469 --> 04:15:52.479 align:start position:0%
face and put it on Fabio's body and make
 
04:15:54.070 --> 04:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
it look like he did something haha
 
04:15:57.030 --> 04:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's all funny look at look at me but
 
04:15:58.469 --> 04:15:58.479 align:start position:0%
if I show
 
04:16:01.349 --> 04:16:01.359 align:start position:0%
you robbing a
 
04:16:04.469 --> 04:16:04.479 align:start position:0%
bank then that's different that is now
 
04:16:06.349 --> 04:16:06.359 align:start position:0%
showing something that did not actually
 
04:16:08.429 --> 04:16:08.439 align:start position:0%
take place but portraying it as being
 
04:16:10.630 --> 04:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
something that did take place and
 
04:16:13.830 --> 04:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:16.910 --> 04:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
problem yeah uh yes
 
04:16:20.790 --> 04:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
certainly um there are a number of this
 
04:16:24.590 --> 04:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
this General topic of AI um and concerns
 
04:16:27.269 --> 04:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
that come out of AI has been raised in a
 
04:16:29.750 --> 04:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
number of committees a number of bills
 
04:16:31.870 --> 04:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
before different committees and
 
04:16:34.389 --> 04:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
different definitions of deep fake and
 
04:16:39.269 --> 04:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence and wondering um
 
04:16:41.030 --> 04:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
whether you would be willing to work
 
04:16:43.149 --> 04:16:43.159 align:start position:0%
with the language so that we can
 
04:16:45.830 --> 04:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
reconcile it with other definitions of
 
04:16:48.670 --> 04:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
AI and deep fake that are coming through
 
04:16:50.990 --> 04:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
other committees and other bills we need
 
04:16:54.229 --> 04:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
consistency within the law and so if we
 
04:16:56.590 --> 04:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that the definitions
 
04:16:59.510 --> 04:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
are adequate and accurate uh then by all
 
04:17:01.309 --> 04:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
means we need to change the language so
 
04:17:03.189 --> 04:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
that it is well understood again the
 
04:17:06.149 --> 04:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
underlying premise of a deep fake is it
 
04:17:08.830 --> 04:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:12.189 --> 04:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
it is portraying something that did not
 
04:17:15.429 --> 04:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
happen but promoting it or or or showing
 
04:17:17.950 --> 04:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
it as being something that did happen
 
04:17:20.070 --> 04:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
and so the the emphasis is on the word
 
04:17:22.990 --> 04:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
fake and that's why it's very D so yes
 
04:17:25.469 --> 04:17:25.479 align:start position:0%
we can always craft the language to be
 
04:17:28.750 --> 04:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
to to be uh uh a
 
04:17:30.990 --> 04:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
better a better understanding of what
 
04:17:32.750 --> 04:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about but the
 
04:17:35.149 --> 04:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
understanding must be that it is a fake
 
04:17:37.389 --> 04:17:37.399 align:start position:0%
and so that's that's
 
04:17:38.710 --> 04:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
I guess that's the most important part
 
04:17:42.109 --> 04:17:42.119 align:start position:0%
of it yeah other questions for this
 
04:17:44.229 --> 04:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative Alexander and
 
04:17:46.510 --> 04:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
04:17:48.670 --> 04:17:48.680 align:start position:0%
Divine thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:17:51.309 --> 04:17:51.319 align:start position:0%
representative this is so fascinating
 
04:17:55.109 --> 04:17:55.119 align:start position:0%
for me I love this area like learning it
 
04:17:57.910 --> 04:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
and it's so new it's like almost scary
 
04:18:01.030 --> 04:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
at like how much we don't know about AI
 
04:18:05.229 --> 04:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
yet I guess my my question comes down
 
04:18:07.510 --> 04:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
to like
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
it talks about any person injured like
 
04:18:12.389 --> 04:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
the damages component of it but what
 
04:18:14.309 --> 04:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
happens if it's the computer that causes
 
04:18:16.229 --> 04:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
the damage not an individual is the
 
04:18:18.429 --> 04:18:18.439 align:start position:0%
individual that made the computer liable
 
04:18:22.070 --> 04:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm like I see AI evolving into
 
04:18:24.670 --> 04:18:24.680 align:start position:0%
this thing where no humans have to
 
04:18:26.510 --> 04:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
interact with it it just starts making
 
04:18:30.309 --> 04:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
stuff right so what happens when we have
 
04:18:32.429 --> 04:18:32.439 align:start position:0%
an RSA or a law at this point that says
 
04:18:33.870 --> 04:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
something like this I I know there's a
 
04:18:35.550 --> 04:18:35.560 align:start position:0%
lot of work need to be done but like
 
04:18:37.790 --> 04:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
what happens next when when does AI
 
04:18:40.790 --> 04:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
become a sentient being supposedly we
 
04:18:41.950 --> 04:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
cross the
 
04:18:45.309 --> 04:18:45.319 align:start position:0%
Rubicon um at that point in time I
 
04:18:46.870 --> 04:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
should probably think we should pray for
 
04:18:50.630 --> 04:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
the end of the world to happen um but
 
04:18:54.469 --> 04:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
because right now it takes somebody
 
04:18:58.870 --> 04:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
initiating some human being has to
 
04:19:02.109 --> 04:19:02.119 align:start position:0%
initiate this deep fake they they it
 
04:19:03.710 --> 04:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
somebody needs to sit down and say I
 
04:19:06.710 --> 04:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
want the frame representative Alexander
 
04:19:08.189 --> 04:19:08.199 align:start position:0%
I want to prevent him from getting
 
04:19:10.630 --> 04:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
reelected uh I want him actually where
 
04:19:12.630 --> 04:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
his neighbors seek to Tar and feather
 
04:19:14.389 --> 04:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
him and run him out of town so that g
 
04:19:16.750 --> 04:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
town is no longer his place of residency
 
04:19:18.429 --> 04:19:18.439 align:start position:0%
wherever he works he's not going to he's
 
04:19:19.830 --> 04:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
going to get fired from there or forced
 
04:19:21.910 --> 04:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
to quit his job and by goly if we can
 
04:19:23.269 --> 04:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
drive him out of New Hampshire that
 
04:19:24.870 --> 04:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
would be even better and you know what
 
04:19:27.469 --> 04:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
if we can just find an you know a grave
 
04:19:29.229 --> 04:19:29.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere and Pitch him in there that's
 
04:19:31.550 --> 04:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
fine too whatever the end result is that
 
04:19:34.030 --> 04:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
they seek there's a human being at the
 
04:19:35.830 --> 04:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
beginning of it seeking some nefarious
 
04:19:37.389 --> 04:19:37.399 align:start position:0%
end to you
 
04:19:40.830 --> 04:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
and so right now that's where we are how
 
04:19:43.910 --> 04:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
we go beyond that where does the AI
 
04:19:46.189 --> 04:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
decide I don't like representative
 
04:19:48.590 --> 04:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
Alexander they've already hated me first
 
04:19:50.830 --> 04:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
so I I'm pretty sure I'm the first one
 
04:19:54.309 --> 04:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
to be in the in that unmarked grave so
 
04:19:56.790 --> 04:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know that we could ever
 
04:19:59.269 --> 04:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
answer that
 
04:20:02.149 --> 04:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
question I representative Divine thank
 
04:20:04.389 --> 04:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr speaker thank you rep gon for
 
04:20:08.269 --> 04:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question um um I'm super
 
04:20:10.309 --> 04:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
excited that you're putting this bill
 
04:20:12.229 --> 04:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
together I think this is much needed
 
04:20:14.030 --> 04:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
with in in light of some of the things
 
04:20:17.229 --> 04:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
that are coming up with AI um one of the
 
04:20:19.710 --> 04:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
things that I'm wondering if this will
 
04:20:23.070 --> 04:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
address or if it's too soon to say is
 
04:20:25.590 --> 04:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
what you have a creator of say a deep
 
04:20:27.950 --> 04:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
fake or digital
 
04:20:33.030 --> 04:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
forgery and it goes out viral on say a
 
04:20:35.710 --> 04:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
distributor's site like say Tik Tok
 
04:20:39.189 --> 04:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
Twitter Facebook meta whatever um this
 
04:20:42.750 --> 04:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
kind of recently happened in in in two
 
04:20:46.950 --> 04:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
two weeks one audio and one video
 
04:20:50.109 --> 04:20:50.119 align:start position:0%
portion um that affected um some very
 
04:20:50.119 --> 04:20:51.990 align:start position:0%
portion um that affected um some very
prominent

04:20:51.990 --> 04:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
prominent
 
04:20:56.429 --> 04:20:56.439 align:start position:0%
people how would this Bill affect the
 
04:20:59.269 --> 04:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
Distributors say like Twitter who you
 
04:21:01.229 --> 04:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
know it's up on their platform like it
 
04:21:03.630 --> 04:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
recently happened would they be
 
04:21:06.790 --> 04:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
accountable for Distributing that type
 
04:21:09.830 --> 04:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
of content it's a good question actually
 
04:21:11.950 --> 04:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately up to this point well
 
04:21:13.309 --> 04:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
fortunately or unfortunately I'm not
 
04:21:17.510 --> 04:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
sure which one um they are not
 
04:21:20.349 --> 04:21:20.359 align:start position:0%
Publishers that's explicitly stated in
 
04:21:23.830 --> 04:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
in in in in federal law they're covered
 
04:21:27.389 --> 04:21:27.399 align:start position:0%
from liability I think it's section 230
 
04:21:29.750 --> 04:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
they are not Publishers they are
 
04:21:32.070 --> 04:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
platforms and as long as they maintain
 
04:21:34.229 --> 04:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
that distinction then they are not
 
04:21:36.870 --> 04:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
liable to what is posted on their
 
04:21:38.790 --> 04:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
platforms and that's where all the
 
04:21:41.349 --> 04:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
censorship comes in I don't like you so
 
04:21:43.189 --> 04:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
I'm going to block all your content that
 
04:21:46.269 --> 04:21:46.279 align:start position:0%
sort of thing
 
04:21:48.910 --> 04:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
uh this bill does not address the
 
04:21:52.510 --> 04:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
platform so Twitter cannot be held or X
 
04:21:55.950 --> 04:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
cannot be held accountable for what you
 
04:21:59.950 --> 04:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
post on there you will be so that's
 
04:22:02.269 --> 04:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
that's the if it would require
 
04:22:05.030 --> 04:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
alterations to to section 230 at the
 
04:22:10.429 --> 04:22:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:13.030 --> 04:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately representative
 
04:22:15.910 --> 04:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
tur yeah thanks Mr chair and thanks for
 
04:22:19.229 --> 04:22:19.239 align:start position:0%
taking the question so I was focused on
 
04:22:23.630 --> 04:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
um on page two the the difference uh s
 
04:22:25.830 --> 04:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
sizable difference between the damages
 
04:22:29.229 --> 04:22:29.239 align:start position:0%
described when this is used against um
 
04:22:33.030 --> 04:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
any individual versus when it's used for
 
04:22:36.070 --> 04:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
um essentially political purposes and
 
04:22:39.030 --> 04:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
you know know it's $10 million cap on on
 
04:22:41.870 --> 04:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh damages to people and essentially a
 
04:22:45.309 --> 04:22:45.319 align:start position:0%
$5,000 penalty um for using this for
 
04:22:47.309 --> 04:22:47.319 align:start position:0%
political purposes
 
04:22:51.550 --> 04:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
um uh I was wondering why why that big
 
04:22:53.870 --> 04:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
disparity I mean we've it seems like the
 
04:22:55.790 --> 04:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
political realm is where this is already
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:05.279 --> 04:23:06.830 align:start position:0%
 
lower

04:23:06.830 --> 04:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
lower
 
04:23:08.189 --> 04:23:08.199 align:start position:0%
I don't have the bill sitting in front
 
04:23:11.309 --> 04:23:11.319 align:start position:0%
of me to know what the exact wording is
 
04:23:11.319 --> 04:23:12.389 align:start position:0%
of me to know what the exact wording is
the

04:23:12.389 --> 04:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:23:15.990 --> 04:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
the I believe it would actually be it
 
04:23:20.309 --> 04:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:23.389 --> 04:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
5,000 yeah I the the phrase I'm looking
 
04:23:25.550 --> 04:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
at and it it's in the section that talks
 
04:23:28.590 --> 04:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
about using it for um to Def defeat a
 
04:23:30.870 --> 04:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
Party U measure or person in any
 
04:23:32.990 --> 04:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
election it says a violation of this
 
04:23:36.030 --> 04:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
section shall result in a civil penalty
 
04:23:40.070 --> 04:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
of $5,000 per violation um and then it
 
04:23:43.030 --> 04:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
goes on to have um you know that you can
 
04:23:45.550 --> 04:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
recover actual damages or $1,000
 
04:23:47.830 --> 04:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
whichever is greater and those numbers
 
04:23:52.950 --> 04:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
seem very low given the um the the
 
04:23:56.429 --> 04:23:56.439 align:start position:0%
utility of this kind of tool in that
 
04:23:59.389 --> 04:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
realm yeah the I mean we could always
 
04:24:03.149 --> 04:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
increase the penalties um the idea being
 
04:24:07.070 --> 04:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
that um one political party could not do
 
04:24:09.109 --> 04:24:09.119 align:start position:0%
one of these deep fakes against an
 
04:24:11.269 --> 04:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
opponent uh trying to smear their
 
04:24:13.149 --> 04:24:13.159 align:start position:0%
reputation again through doing some kind
 
04:24:15.590 --> 04:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
of of harm and then just under the guise
 
04:24:17.389 --> 04:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
of well that's just
 
04:24:19.710 --> 04:24:19.720 align:start position:0%
politics um a lot of times politicians
 
04:24:22.710 --> 04:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
are not are not covered or protected by
 
04:24:25.149 --> 04:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
slander uh they're not protected from
 
04:24:27.950 --> 04:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
other attacks against them and so this
 
04:24:30.189 --> 04:24:30.199 align:start position:0%
is a means of protecting even
 
04:24:32.189 --> 04:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
politicians they should be protected as
 
04:24:34.389 --> 04:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
well because a lie is just as damaging
 
04:24:36.149 --> 04:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
to a politician as it is any other
 
04:24:38.309 --> 04:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
private citizen you don't forfeit your
 
04:24:39.950 --> 04:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
rights just because you run for
 
04:24:42.189 --> 04:24:42.199 align:start position:0%
political office and so there needs to
 
04:24:46.070 --> 04:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:46.080 --> 04:24:49.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:24:49.550 --> 04:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:52.429 --> 04:24:52.439 align:start position:0%
the so any person injured by another's
 
04:24:53.950 --> 04:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
violation of this section may bring an
 
04:24:55.790 --> 04:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
action for damages and for Equitable
 
04:24:57.750 --> 04:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
relief including an injunction as the
 
04:25:01.950 --> 04:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
court deems necessary uh and proper and
 
04:25:04.389 --> 04:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
then it says the actual damages of
 
04:25:07.630 --> 04:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
$1,000 actual damages or $1,000 which is
 
04:25:12.349 --> 04:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
greater and so uh the court will
 
04:25:18.389 --> 04:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:21.309 --> 04:25:21.319 align:start position:0%
the the the section that says damage is
 
04:25:22.710 --> 04:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
awarded under the section shall not
 
04:25:25.269 --> 04:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
exceed $10 million per
 
04:25:29.349 --> 04:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
claim is in this is in the section above
 
04:25:32.149 --> 04:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
that so if the fraud fraudulent use of
 
04:25:34.630 --> 04:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
AI led to the loss of employment damages
 
04:25:36.710 --> 04:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
totaling twice a person's salary for the
 
04:25:37.950 --> 04:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
duration of the unemployment not to
 
04:25:39.750 --> 04:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
exceed one year shall be awarded if
 
04:25:41.469 --> 04:25:41.479 align:start position:0%
you're fired because of this then
 
04:25:43.830 --> 04:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
there's awards for that but the overall
 
04:25:46.309 --> 04:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
amount of Damages in your civilian in
 
04:25:47.469 --> 04:25:47.479 align:start position:0%
your in your
 
04:25:47.479 --> 04:25:49.269 align:start position:0%
your in your
private

04:25:49.269 --> 04:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
private
 
04:25:53.070 --> 04:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
claim is no is limited to $10 million
 
04:25:55.990 --> 04:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay in the political
 
04:25:57.750 --> 04:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
field it
 
04:26:01.870 --> 04:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
is the the actual damages of $1,000
 
04:26:03.750 --> 04:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
actual damages or a th000 so the minimum
 
04:26:03.760 --> 04:26:04.389 align:start position:0%
actual damages or a th000 so the minimum
is

04:26:04.389 --> 04:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:26:06.670 --> 04:26:06.680 align:start position:0%
$1,000 you know if they're it but you
 
04:26:09.389 --> 04:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
you would be protected in both uh in in
 
04:26:11.309 --> 04:26:11.319 align:start position:0%
both ways you're running you're running
 
04:26:14.870 --> 04:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
for office but you're also Mr
 
04:26:18.870 --> 04:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
T and so you have protection because you
 
04:26:21.030 --> 04:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
have a job that you work if if that
 
04:26:23.870 --> 04:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
affects your job you have that portion
 
04:26:25.870 --> 04:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
if it affects your ability in in office
 
04:26:28.229 --> 04:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
it affects this and so you're protected
 
04:26:31.510 --> 04:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
in both but your actual damages under
 
04:26:33.630 --> 04:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
just the political section of it are
 
04:26:36.109 --> 04:26:36.119 align:start position:0%
going to be minimally uh uh minimal
 
04:26:40.429 --> 04:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
compared to your private life so I I I I
 
04:26:42.870 --> 04:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
have no problem with with increasing
 
04:26:45.149 --> 04:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
penalties um if that's if that's what we
 
04:26:49.510 --> 04:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
need to do um but the the portion that
 
04:26:50.429 --> 04:26:50.439 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:26:52.349 --> 04:26:52.359 align:start position:0%
is I guess I should say the most
 
04:26:53.670 --> 04:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
significant or the most important part
 
04:26:55.710 --> 04:26:55.720 align:start position:0%
of this bill is the private right of
 
04:26:58.189 --> 04:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
action that if you are harmed personally
 
04:27:00.710 --> 04:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
you have a right of action to that can I
 
04:27:03.389 --> 04:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
just quick follow up on that um and and
 
04:27:05.149 --> 04:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make it clear I do not
 
04:27:07.990 --> 04:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
dispute either of those instances it's
 
04:27:11.349 --> 04:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
just when I look at the the the section
 
04:27:13.630 --> 04:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
down below about um using this for
 
04:27:16.109 --> 04:27:16.119 align:start position:0%
political purposes it seems as though
 
04:27:18.429 --> 04:27:18.439 align:start position:0%
the the levels that are set could be
 
04:27:20.149 --> 04:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
seen almost as the cost of doing
 
04:27:22.349 --> 04:27:22.359 align:start position:0%
business for the modern political
 
04:27:26.030 --> 04:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
campaign I mean you know $5,000 is is
 
04:27:28.109 --> 04:27:28.119 align:start position:0%
you know unfortunate but it's a drop in
 
04:27:29.309 --> 04:27:29.319 align:start position:0%
the bucket for what some of these
 
04:27:31.229 --> 04:27:31.239 align:start position:0%
campaigns do and and I'm not sure how
 
04:27:33.229 --> 04:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
you would calculate the damages right
 
04:27:35.389 --> 04:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
you know if say somebody puts out a
 
04:27:37.590 --> 04:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
statement you know that makes it sound
 
04:27:38.950 --> 04:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
like you said something you didn't which
 
04:27:43.469 --> 04:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
we just saw recently happen yep
 
04:27:47.309 --> 04:27:47.319 align:start position:0%
yeah again I I have no issues with with
 
04:27:50.630 --> 04:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
bumping up the penalties for that um my
 
04:27:54.229 --> 04:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
my objective was to make sure that no
 
04:27:56.030 --> 04:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
this is not just
 
04:28:01.950 --> 04:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:04.830 --> 04:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
so other questions for this
 
04:28:08.349 --> 04:28:08.359 align:start position:0%
Witness seeing none thank
 
04:28:08.359 --> 04:28:13.030 align:start position:0%
Witness seeing none thank

04:28:15.750 --> 04:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
next let me just make sure we
 
04:28:19.229 --> 04:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
don't we don't have any
 
04:28:19.239 --> 04:28:21.910 align:start position:0%
don't we don't have any
reps

please good afternoon Mr Speaker members
 
04:28:58.710 --> 04:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Tamara
 
04:29:01.030 --> 04:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
Hester I am a lieutenant with the New
 
04:29:03.349 --> 04:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police I am assigned to
 
04:29:05.830 --> 04:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
the special investigations unit with
 
04:29:08.510 --> 04:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
where in our unit we investigate cyber
 
04:29:10.630 --> 04:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
crimes child exploitation and we conduct
 
04:29:13.630 --> 04:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
digital forensics not necessarily here
 
04:29:16.710 --> 04:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
speaking in uh opposition or support of
 
04:29:18.950 --> 04:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
this bill in general I just wanted to
 
04:29:21.429 --> 04:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
bring up a couple of the concerns uh
 
04:29:22.630 --> 04:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
that some of them have already been
 
04:29:24.070 --> 04:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
brought up by other members of the
 
04:29:25.990 --> 04:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
committee already about some of the
 
04:29:28.910 --> 04:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
language as the bill as it is currently
 
04:29:31.269 --> 04:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
currently written
 
04:29:33.550 --> 04:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
um I was
 
04:29:36.189 --> 04:29:36.199 align:start position:0%
hoping basically it's important that as
 
04:29:38.469 --> 04:29:38.479 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in order to enforce the
 
04:29:41.309 --> 04:29:41.319 align:start position:0%
laws we actually understand the law as
 
04:29:44.830 --> 04:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
it stands uh paragraph 3 the way that
 
04:29:48.109 --> 04:29:48.119 align:start position:0%
it's written which would be on page
 
04:29:50.670 --> 04:29:50.680 align:start position:0%
actually would be page one of the bill
 
04:29:54.109 --> 04:29:54.119 align:start position:0%
as it stands um and I'm not sure if the
 
04:29:56.469 --> 04:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
sponsor can elaborate a little bit on
 
04:29:58.790 --> 04:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
that it's just the language is a little
 
04:30:01.469 --> 04:30:01.479 align:start position:0%
bit confusing as a law enforcement
 
04:30:03.109 --> 04:30:03.119 align:start position:0%
officer I'm having difficulty
 
04:30:05.790 --> 04:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
understanding what uh that might mean in
 
04:30:09.149 --> 04:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
order to enforce that law if it I guess
 
04:30:10.910 --> 04:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
an example of what I'm thinking in my
 
04:30:13.229 --> 04:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
head and I'm hoping maybe we could get
 
04:30:15.710 --> 04:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
maybe a clearer definition would be if
 
04:30:18.830 --> 04:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
somebody uses a deep fake if somebody
 
04:30:21.790 --> 04:30:21.800 align:start position:0%
wiretapped an individual in order to get
 
04:30:24.030 --> 04:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
their voice to use that likeness in
 
04:30:26.550 --> 04:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
order to commit the offense using
 
04:30:28.590 --> 04:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence is that kind of
 
04:30:31.229 --> 04:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
what that paragraph is intended is
 
04:30:33.550 --> 04:30:33.560 align:start position:0%
intended to mean that's uh one of the
 
04:30:37.830 --> 04:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
concerns I certainly um agree with um
 
04:30:40.229 --> 04:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
the sponsor as well as the members of
 
04:30:42.229 --> 04:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
this Committee in the sense that it's
 
04:30:44.950 --> 04:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
really important that we as a state get
 
04:30:47.670 --> 04:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
ahead of artificial intelligence because
 
04:30:49.990 --> 04:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it is being used to
 
04:30:53.229 --> 04:30:53.239 align:start position:0%
exploit individuals online across many
 
04:30:55.670 --> 04:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
different platforms so I don't disagree
 
04:30:58.790 --> 04:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
with that in any sense um but there's a
 
04:31:00.349 --> 04:31:00.359 align:start position:0%
couple other laws that are already on
 
04:31:03.469 --> 04:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
the books that um as one of the sponsors
 
04:31:04.830 --> 04:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh excuse me one of the
 
04:31:07.710 --> 04:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
representatives mentioned um have
 
04:31:10.469 --> 04:31:10.479 align:start position:0%
similar language being introduced uh
 
04:31:14.590 --> 04:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
this this year to talk about um C
 
04:31:16.309 --> 04:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
combating artificial intelligence some
 
04:31:18.750 --> 04:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
of those other bills use uh synthetic
 
04:31:22.070 --> 04:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
images I think as a definition obviously
 
04:31:25.429 --> 04:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
that doesn't uh Encompass the whole of
 
04:31:28.469 --> 04:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
this statute as the fact that audio
 
04:31:30.389 --> 04:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
recordings could also be included so it
 
04:31:32.070 --> 04:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
may need to be broader but I do
 
04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
definitely agree with uh potentially
 
04:31:36.550 --> 04:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
modifying the definition so that is a
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
little more um Limited in
 
04:31:42.510 --> 04:31:42.520 align:start position:0%
scope that and there's a few other
 
04:31:45.790 --> 04:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
statutes already that I understand
 
04:31:48.429 --> 04:31:48.439 align:start position:0%
certainly having a penalty for this but
 
04:31:50.750 --> 04:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily the penalty for
 
04:31:54.109 --> 04:31:54.119 align:start position:0%
this as it stands doesn't necessarily um
 
04:31:55.990 --> 04:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
match up to some of the other penalties
 
04:31:58.950 --> 04:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
that exist that are similar specifically
 
04:32:02.590 --> 04:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
um where this is going in 638 so we have
 
04:32:05.189 --> 04:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
harassment uh which falls under 6 RS say
 
04:32:08.349 --> 04:32:08.359 align:start position:0%
6 38 violation of privacy uh which falls
 
04:32:11.309 --> 04:32:11.319 align:start position:0%
under 644 and criminal defamation which
 
04:32:14.030 --> 04:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
falls under 644 but all of those are
 
04:32:16.590 --> 04:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors so this would be a felony
 
04:32:18.670 --> 04:32:18.680 align:start position:0%
so it just the penalty of this crime
 
04:32:20.429 --> 04:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily marry up with some
 
04:32:22.349 --> 04:32:22.359 align:start position:0%
of the other statutes that are that are
 
04:32:24.510 --> 04:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
similar to it so those are really just
 
04:32:27.870 --> 04:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
some of the um concerns that that I
 
04:32:30.950 --> 04:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to address and I think um one of
 
04:32:32.309 --> 04:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
the other Representatives brought up
 
04:32:34.269 --> 04:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
where where the origin is it so is it
 
04:32:36.670 --> 04:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
the if any body who subsequently
 
04:32:39.389 --> 04:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
disseminates this deep fake are they
 
04:32:42.030 --> 04:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
also going to to be guilty of the same
 
04:32:44.229 --> 04:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
crime or is it intended to be the
 
04:32:46.950 --> 04:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
originator of the uh deep fake that is
 
04:32:50.630 --> 04:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
the uh person who's going to be held
 
04:32:54.950 --> 04:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
responsible all right questions for this
 
04:33:00.830 --> 04:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:03.551 --> 04:33:03.561 align:start position:0%
you um is there anyone
 
04:33:06.390 --> 04:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
else um who wishes to
 
04:33:10.150 --> 04:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
appear um on hb1 1432 and I should know
 
04:33:14.390 --> 04:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
we have um we have a letter uh received
 
04:33:18.070 --> 04:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
from Timothy Wilkerson of the New
 
04:33:20.029 --> 04:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
England connectivity and
 
04:33:20.039 --> 04:33:21.830 align:start position:0%
England connectivity and
Telecommunications

04:33:21.830 --> 04:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications
 
04:33:25.670 --> 04:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
Association um does everybody which I
 
04:33:27.590 --> 04:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
passed out so uh then that's in
 
04:33:32.750 --> 04:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to uh to the bill um I don't
 
04:33:35.029 --> 04:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
have any other uh pin cards anyone else
 
04:33:38.429 --> 04:33:38.439 align:start position:0%
who wishes to be heard on House Bill
 
04:33:42.070 --> 04:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
1432 and I should note that there are uh
 
04:33:43.470 --> 04:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
from the signup sheet there are six
 
04:33:46.269 --> 04:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
people in support and three people
 
04:33:46.279 --> 04:33:47.789 align:start position:0%
people in support and three people
opposed

04:33:47.789 --> 04:33:47.799 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
04:33:51.070 --> 04:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
um all right seeing no one else who has
 
04:33:52.789 --> 04:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
uh any interest in in testifying I'm
 
04:33:55.830 --> 04:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
going to close the hearing on House Bill
 
04:33:59.310 --> 04:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
1432 and it looks like we have uh a few
 
04:34:00.629 --> 04:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
minutes before we
 
04:34:03.830 --> 04:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
begin uh the bill of the hearing on 1475
 
04:34:08.990 --> 04:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:12.189 --> 04:34:12.199 align:start position:0%
yeah that's good so you know what
 
04:34:21.551 --> 04:34:21.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:25.070 --> 04:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
right so you know what um oops my link
 
04:34:28.709 --> 04:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:31.629 --> 04:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
um G we're going to exact
 
04:34:35.830 --> 04:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
12:45 okay soon as Scott gets back no
 
04:34:47.510 --> 04:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:49.750 --> 04:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
great I'm happy to make the motion and
 
04:34:51.390 --> 04:34:51.400 align:start position:0%
do the report if you want to have the
 
04:34:53.869 --> 04:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
report time
 
04:34:57.510 --> 04:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
okay sounds great she'll make the motion
 
04:34:59.109 --> 04:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
I have the report from last time so I'm
 
04:35:00.750 --> 04:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
happy to do it and use the same report
 
04:35:04.349 --> 04:35:04.359 align:start position:0%
we used last time okay all right so have
 
04:35:06.510 --> 04:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
we got who's we waiting for oh there's
 
04:35:10.070 --> 04:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
Joe okay all right um all right so I'm
 
04:35:14.150 --> 04:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
going to uh since we have a few minutes
 
04:35:18.029 --> 04:35:18.039 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to uh uh reconvene the
 
04:35:20.990 --> 04:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee uh for an executive
 
04:35:24.470 --> 04:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
session with regard to House Bill
 
04:35:26.990 --> 04:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
1245 um I've conferred with the ranking
 
04:35:30.470 --> 04:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
member and we both agree uh that this uh
 
04:35:35.830 --> 04:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
that this bill can be exact now um
 
04:35:39.150 --> 04:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
the uh as as we heard from the testimony
 
04:35:41.029 --> 04:35:41.039 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:35:44.590 --> 04:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
exactly word for word a bill that we
 
04:35:48.349 --> 04:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
passed out of this committee last time
 
04:35:50.830 --> 04:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
and actually it passed the Full House La
 
04:35:54.551 --> 04:35:54.561 align:start position:0%
the last time um it it died in the other
 
04:35:59.510 --> 04:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
body um so uh um I think it's entirely
 
04:36:02.230 --> 04:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate that we exact uh this bill
 
04:36:03.830 --> 04:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
now in the interest of of you know
 
04:36:05.750 --> 04:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
moving our business along as
 
04:36:08.551 --> 04:36:08.561 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible so um do I have
 
04:36:10.070 --> 04:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to recognize representative
 
04:36:13.910 --> 04:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
katab for a motion I move on to pass is
 
04:36:15.551 --> 04:36:15.561 align:start position:0%
there is there second representative
 
04:36:19.590 --> 04:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
Smith second um uh any further
 
04:36:19.600 --> 04:36:21.551 align:start position:0%
Smith second um uh any further
discussion

04:36:21.551 --> 04:36:21.561 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:36:23.830 --> 04:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
or I think we've P you know we went
 
04:36:25.349 --> 04:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
through this the last time and we
 
04:36:28.789 --> 04:36:28.799 align:start position:0%
amended it as needed and I think that
 
04:36:33.150 --> 04:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
it's ready to move forward right any any
 
04:36:37.470 --> 04:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
further discussion on how House Bill
 
04:36:40.029 --> 04:36:40.039 align:start position:0%
1245 represent wh yes representative
 
04:36:42.109 --> 04:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
Perez I just want to state that the
 
04:36:44.789 --> 04:36:44.799 align:start position:0%
information that was brought forward by
 
04:36:48.310 --> 04:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
the woman from the committee um I think
 
04:36:51.070 --> 04:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
she had some very valid things that that
 
04:36:52.709 --> 04:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
group should have been involved with
 
04:36:55.670 --> 04:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
this from from day one since they are
 
04:36:59.510 --> 04:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
the PE the keepers or the of of this
 
04:37:01.349 --> 04:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
group of individuals so I just think
 
04:37:06.109 --> 04:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
that I just don't think we should um
 
04:37:08.629 --> 04:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
discard the fact that she had some
 
04:37:12.109 --> 04:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
extremely valid points in the fact that
 
04:37:13.590 --> 04:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
they should have been involved and it
 
04:37:18.949 --> 04:37:18.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:22.750 --> 04:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
involved right I'm sorry representative
 
04:37:24.830 --> 04:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
Alexander um and I happen to disagree
 
04:37:27.789 --> 04:37:27.799 align:start position:0%
with my friend um I think that because
 
04:37:29.029 --> 04:37:29.039 align:start position:0%
these meetings we've been talking about
 
04:37:31.629 --> 04:37:31.639 align:start position:0%
this bill for a year these meetings have
 
04:37:34.470 --> 04:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
been all public and I believe if there's
 
04:37:36.629 --> 04:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
something a department or a committee or
 
04:37:39.590 --> 04:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
somebody that would like to be involved
 
04:37:41.269 --> 04:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
the onus is on them to get involved in
 
04:37:44.070 --> 04:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
the process early on I think it's it
 
04:37:46.590 --> 04:37:46.600 align:start position:0%
startles me that when somebody comes in
 
04:37:48.470 --> 04:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
and no offense if she did not know or
 
04:37:50.551 --> 04:37:50.561 align:start position:0%
the organization didn't know but comes
 
04:37:53.150 --> 04:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
in at the fifth hour to come in and
 
04:37:55.230 --> 04:37:55.240 align:start position:0%
raise concerns it's a way to defeat a
 
04:37:58.629 --> 04:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
bill that might be that is a good bill
 
04:38:02.109 --> 04:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
and we've we vetted it carefully to the
 
04:38:05.990 --> 04:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee any representative Perez
 
04:38:08.709 --> 04:38:08.719 align:start position:0%

04:38:17.830 --> 04:38:17.840 align:start position:0%

04:38:21.349 --> 04:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
if she really wants to be involved in in
 
04:38:23.910 --> 04:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh the discussion she can always go to
 
04:38:26.189 --> 04:38:26.199 align:start position:0%
the Senate since they're going to hear
 
04:38:29.750 --> 04:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
it also so I think that uh our moving
 
04:38:33.349 --> 04:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
the bill along is a good idea thank you

04:48:04.430 --> 04:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
up Travis Quirk uh repres presed from
 
04:48:06.910 --> 04:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 44 U my thanks to the chair
 
04:48:10.350 --> 04:48:10.360 align:start position:0%
and to the committee um I'll be fairly
 
04:48:12.830 --> 04:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
brief uh to explain the problem is to
 
04:48:15.708 --> 04:48:15.718 align:start position:0%
sort of suggest the solution the concept
 
04:48:18.310 --> 04:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
of slap or strategic lawsuit against
 
04:48:18.320 --> 04:48:19.190 align:start position:0%
of slap or strategic lawsuit against
public

04:48:19.190 --> 04:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:48:21.548 --> 04:48:21.558 align:start position:0%
participation is a lawsuit that is not
 
04:48:23.310 --> 04:48:23.320 align:start position:0%
designed to actually accomplish its
 
04:48:25.868 --> 04:48:25.878 align:start position:0%
stated goals but is intended as a
 
04:48:28.070 --> 04:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
strategic move in a greater game which
 
04:48:29.868 --> 04:48:29.878 align:start position:0%
is influencing public
 
04:48:33.270 --> 04:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
policy so um examples of when this might
 
04:48:35.670 --> 04:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
happen have uh occurred in a lot of
 
04:48:37.948 --> 04:48:37.958 align:start position:0%
areas um across the country and this is
 
04:48:39.548 --> 04:48:39.558 align:start position:0%
sort of a non-political issue which is
 
04:48:41.390 --> 04:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
to say that it's both a left and a right
 
04:48:45.150 --> 04:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
problem so you might have um for example
 
04:48:48.030 --> 04:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
a anti-act farming activist who is
 
04:48:49.990 --> 04:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
speaking about conditions in a factory
 
04:48:52.548 --> 04:48:52.558 align:start position:0%
farm and they will get sued by the
 
04:48:54.990 --> 04:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
factory farm for a lot of issues uh such
 
04:48:57.788 --> 04:48:57.798 align:start position:0%
as defamation or you know other things
 
04:49:00.390 --> 04:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
and the goal is not actually to um you
 
04:49:02.910 --> 04:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
know a normal defamation lawsuit of of
 
04:49:05.470 --> 04:49:05.480 align:start position:0%
actually seeking to recover um things
 
04:49:08.590 --> 04:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
the actual goal is to chill speech and
 
04:49:10.548 --> 04:49:10.558 align:start position:0%
this works both in the primary way um
 
04:49:12.030 --> 04:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
against the actual person who's being
 
04:49:15.310 --> 04:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
sued but in a secondary way of um
 
04:49:17.190 --> 04:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
setting an example for the others so you
 
04:49:18.788 --> 04:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
know the next activist who comes along
 
04:49:21.230 --> 04:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
thinks do I really want to take a second
 
04:49:23.670 --> 04:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
mortgage on my house for $100,000 so
 
04:49:25.510 --> 04:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
that I can afford to mount a defense
 
04:49:27.830 --> 04:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
against some multi-billion dollar firm
 
04:49:30.390 --> 04:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh that's a example that would you know
 
04:49:31.990 --> 04:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully get the sympathies of those
 
04:49:32.910 --> 04:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
left of
 
04:49:35.270 --> 04:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
center but this can also work in the
 
04:49:37.548 --> 04:49:37.558 align:start position:0%
other direction where a pastor running a
 
04:49:40.230 --> 04:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
small church out of his garage uh could
 
04:49:41.708 --> 04:49:41.718 align:start position:0%
get sued for statements that he makes
 
04:49:44.230 --> 04:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
that go against some large corporation
 
04:49:47.548 --> 04:49:47.558 align:start position:0%
or large NGO with a huge budget and this
 
04:49:49.868 --> 04:49:49.878 align:start position:0%
is not a theoretical problem um there
 
04:49:52.190 --> 04:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
have been hundreds of such lawsuits uh
 
04:49:53.470 --> 04:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
and this has happened you know for
 
04:49:55.510 --> 04:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
decades and the fact that it's happened
 
04:49:58.070 --> 04:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
has given rise to a you know solution to
 
04:50:00.430 --> 04:50:00.440 align:start position:0%
the problem which is anti-s slap
 
04:50:02.548 --> 04:50:02.558 align:start position:0%
legislation New Hampshire is in the
 
04:50:04.830 --> 04:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
minority there you know obviously 50
 
04:50:06.548 --> 04:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
states and I believe 32 of them already
 
04:50:09.150 --> 04:50:09.160 align:start position:0%
have anti-ap legislation there are
 
04:50:11.990 --> 04:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
several groups that publish uh reference
 
04:50:14.030 --> 04:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
standards and this proposed uh
 
04:50:16.230 --> 04:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
legislation uh has been you know
 
04:50:18.030 --> 04:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
designed with reference to these other
 
04:50:18.910 --> 04:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
things that have been through the
 
04:50:20.310 --> 04:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
crucibles of multiple States
 
04:50:23.230 --> 04:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
legislatures and committees the goal is
 
04:50:25.310 --> 04:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
basically or the mechanism of an anti-s
 
04:50:29.110 --> 04:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
slap uh bill is basically to uh Empower
 
04:50:31.230 --> 04:50:31.240 align:start position:0%
as a defense against these things that
 
04:50:35.070 --> 04:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
you know hey I'm actually uh the the uh
 
04:50:37.910 --> 04:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
Speech I'm engaged in is uh political
 
04:50:42.030 --> 04:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
speech um and your lawsuit against it is
 
04:50:44.030 --> 04:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
designed as a political act so the goal
 
04:50:48.590 --> 04:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
is really to um refuse uh the larger you
 
04:50:50.628 --> 04:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
know um Rich entities whether it's a
 
04:50:52.548 --> 04:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
for-profit corporation or a very large
 
04:50:55.430 --> 04:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
NGO um to stop them from weaponizing the
 
04:50:58.430 --> 04:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
courts against the sort of uh smaller uh
 
04:51:00.990 --> 04:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
protester or church owner uh or you know
 
04:51:04.430 --> 04:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
gun store owner Etc and um I have uh
 
04:51:06.590 --> 04:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
testifying after me a friend and
 
04:51:09.110 --> 04:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
compatriot attorney Mark rzza who has
 
04:51:10.868 --> 04:51:10.878 align:start position:0%
been very active in free speech issues
 
04:51:14.310 --> 04:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
for a long time so uh for any detailed
 
04:51:16.470 --> 04:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
questions uh I might say you know please
 
04:51:18.548 --> 04:51:18.558 align:start position:0%
talk to the expert um but I'd be happy
 
04:51:20.430 --> 04:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
to answer general
 
04:51:23.270 --> 04:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this witness yes
 
04:51:25.788 --> 04:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you thanks
 
04:51:28.708 --> 04:51:28.718 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so in the town I
 
04:51:32.390 --> 04:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
live in we had a horrendous incident um
 
04:51:36.910 --> 04:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
that ended up with a judge writing a 12
 
04:51:41.070 --> 04:51:41.080 align:start position:0%
page slap on the hands to the people who
 
04:51:43.310 --> 04:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
brought this lawsuit against this person
 
04:51:45.190 --> 04:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
so is this going to protect the little
 
04:51:46.948 --> 04:51:46.958 align:start position:0%
guy too you talked about Corp that is
 
04:51:48.708 --> 04:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
entirely the goal it is protect the
 
04:51:50.750 --> 04:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
little guy against the multi-billion
 
04:51:52.868 --> 04:51:52.878 align:start position:0%
dollar firms well not only multi-billion
 
04:51:55.030 --> 04:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
dollar film this was a municipality that
 
04:51:57.390 --> 04:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
okay you know and and that's I always
 
04:51:59.110 --> 04:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
say I'm here for the little
 
04:52:01.868 --> 04:52:01.878 align:start position:0%
guy that's what we need this for and
 
04:52:04.190 --> 04:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
this will protect
 
04:52:07.110 --> 04:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
them from doing absolutely and uh to to
 
04:52:09.190 --> 04:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
go meta for just a moment if you look at
 
04:52:12.070 --> 04:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
my bio on the general court website the
 
04:52:13.430 --> 04:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
reason I'm here in this room and wearing
 
04:52:15.230 --> 04:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
a suit as opposed to my normal t-shirt
 
04:52:16.590 --> 04:52:16.600 align:start position:0%
is because I was in something very
 
04:52:19.390 --> 04:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
similar uh just absolutely brutalized uh
 
04:52:21.948 --> 04:52:21.958 align:start position:0%
by the good old boys network in my town
 
04:52:25.270 --> 04:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
where law was used as a weapon where my
 
04:52:27.150 --> 04:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
budget came out of you know my pocket
 
04:52:28.150 --> 04:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
and their budget came out of the
 
04:52:30.310 --> 04:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so we're on exactly the same
 
04:52:31.510 --> 04:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
side well
 
04:52:34.110 --> 04:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
fortunately this judge made the 10 pay
 
04:52:36.470 --> 04:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
for hers too so that's wonderful I'm
 
04:52:38.150 --> 04:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
glad that uh some stories even if not
 
04:52:41.230 --> 04:52:41.240 align:start position:0%
mine have a happy ending
 
04:52:45.708 --> 04:52:45.718 align:start position:0%
yeah other questions for this
 
04:52:48.150 --> 04:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
04:52:50.548 --> 04:52:50.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time well you know
 
04:52:52.670 --> 04:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I have one question this you
 
04:52:54.830 --> 04:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
said that there are 32 states that have
 
04:52:59.110 --> 04:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
anti-s slap bills is the in drafting
 
04:53:02.390 --> 04:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
this bill is this based on the language
 
04:53:04.750 --> 04:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
of those other state bills and if I'm
 
04:53:06.910 --> 04:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
going to have to look to my coach for a
 
04:53:06.920 --> 04:53:08.910 align:start position:0%
going to have to look to my coach for a
hint

04:53:08.910 --> 04:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
hint
 
04:53:14.190 --> 04:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
yes all right thank you thank you right
 
04:53:17.030 --> 04:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh next I'm going to call
 
04:53:32.390 --> 04:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:34.590 --> 04:53:34.600 align:start position:0%
please okay yep turn the microphone
 
04:53:36.868 --> 04:53:36.878 align:start position:0%
thank you there we go I'd like to start
 
04:53:39.510 --> 04:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh by answering a a couple of your
 
04:53:41.788 --> 04:53:41.798 align:start position:0%
questions in a little more detail
 
04:53:44.990 --> 04:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative Paige your qu oh I'm
 
04:53:47.470 --> 04:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm I'm sorry I'm not from here
 
04:53:49.110 --> 04:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking at the uh the angle
 
04:53:52.670 --> 04:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
there representative Perez this anti-s
 
04:53:55.190 --> 04:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
slap law is I think the best one that
 
04:53:56.750 --> 04:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
has been proposed that will protect the
 
04:54:00.470 --> 04:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
little guy um I study these uh
 
04:54:03.548 --> 04:54:03.558 align:start position:0%
Nationwide I do anti-s slap litigation
 
04:54:06.150 --> 04:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
Nationwide as well as plaintiff side uh
 
04:54:07.788 --> 04:54:07.798 align:start position:0%
defamation cases
 
04:54:09.990 --> 04:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
Nationwide uh and a great example of one
 
04:54:11.990 --> 04:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
that does not protect the little guy is
 
04:54:14.670 --> 04:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
for example Florida which was written by
 
04:54:16.070 --> 04:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
lobbyists for the motion picture
 
04:54:18.150 --> 04:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
industry and it protects motion picture
 
04:54:21.390 --> 04:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
uh producers and uh Publishers of books
 
04:54:23.948 --> 04:54:23.958 align:start position:0%
and Publishers of newspapers but if you
 
04:54:25.708 --> 04:54:25.718 align:start position:0%
were to write a negative review of a
 
04:54:27.510 --> 04:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
hotel or something like that and got
 
04:54:29.788 --> 04:54:29.798 align:start position:0%
sued for it that is not a work under the
 
04:54:32.590 --> 04:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
statute so you wouldn't be protected um
 
04:54:34.310 --> 04:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
the other way the little guy gets stuck
 
04:54:38.390 --> 04:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
in a lot of these laws is there are uh
 
04:54:40.708 --> 04:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
Forum Shopping tricks you can engage in
 
04:54:44.030 --> 04:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
in order to evade a good anti-s slap law
 
04:54:47.350 --> 04:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
so I have defended people who get sued
 
04:54:49.670 --> 04:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
in another state where for example the
 
04:54:51.750 --> 04:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
plaintiff in one case I'm working on is
 
04:54:54.708 --> 04:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
in Colorado they have a very good not a
 
04:54:57.470 --> 04:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
great but very good anti-sap law he made
 
04:54:59.270 --> 04:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
sure to find another jurisdiction that
 
04:55:02.788 --> 04:55:02.798 align:start position:0%
didn't have one to sue in so the poor
 
04:55:05.070 --> 04:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
guy getting SU is now looking at I
 
04:55:06.830 --> 04:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
should be protected by an anti-s slap
 
04:55:08.910 --> 04:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
law here because it's supposed to limit
 
04:55:11.548 --> 04:55:11.558 align:start position:0%
how somebody engages in a in a tort but
 
04:55:14.830 --> 04:55:14.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work that way um and then uh
 
04:55:17.430 --> 04:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chair you asked if this was based on
 
04:55:19.990 --> 04:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
the other anti-s slap laws it's based on
 
04:55:21.990 --> 04:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
two it has really two genetic strains to
 
04:55:26.350 --> 04:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
it one is the prevailing I'd say Central
 
04:55:29.270 --> 04:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
finite curve of anti-sap laws what it
 
04:55:32.150 --> 04:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
protects but also in assisting uh
 
04:55:34.628 --> 04:55:34.638 align:start position:0%
representative corkin with this I
 
04:55:37.990 --> 04:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
brought a body of 20 odd years of
 
04:55:39.788 --> 04:55:39.798 align:start position:0%
litigation experience saying these are
 
04:55:42.190 --> 04:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
the places where other states have had
 
04:55:45.310 --> 04:55:45.320 align:start position:0%
problems or where there have been uh
 
04:55:48.548 --> 04:55:48.558 align:start position:0%
failures in the anti-sap law an example
 
04:55:50.868 --> 04:55:50.878 align:start position:0%
is uh Mr surami who's going to testify
 
04:55:52.868 --> 04:55:52.878 align:start position:0%
later I believe is from Connecticut
 
04:55:55.510 --> 04:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
Connecticut's did not establish the
 
04:55:57.750 --> 04:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
right to an interlocutory appeal very
 
04:56:01.270 --> 04:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
well so it does exist now because Mr
 
04:56:03.030 --> 04:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
sarami brilliantly handled the case in
 
04:56:05.150 --> 04:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
front of the Connecticut Supreme Court
 
04:56:08.270 --> 04:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
that then established that however here
 
04:56:12.110 --> 04:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
you've taken care of that uh this bill
 
04:56:14.750 --> 04:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
really takes look the first amendment is
 
04:56:17.990 --> 04:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
to me uh practically a religion uh it's
 
04:56:19.990 --> 04:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
a promise that we have the right to
 
04:56:23.548 --> 04:56:23.558 align:start position:0%
engage in wide openen and robust
 
04:56:26.948 --> 04:56:26.958 align:start position:0%
debate however that promise is ephemeral
 
04:56:29.310 --> 04:56:29.320 align:start position:0%
if you do have to say you know I
 
04:56:30.510 --> 04:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
remember there was a quote from Henry
 
04:56:32.270 --> 04:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
loose that said if you want a free press
 
04:56:33.990 --> 04:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead and buy one
 
04:56:36.150 --> 04:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
well if you want free speech go ahead
 
04:56:38.868 --> 04:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
and buy it you know the the thing that
 
04:56:40.830 --> 04:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
inspired me to get involved in this kind
 
04:56:43.548 --> 04:56:43.558 align:start position:0%
of thing was uh my my really my very
 
04:56:46.190 --> 04:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
first case I ever handled all on my own
 
04:56:48.788 --> 04:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
as a lawyer and there I was with a you
 
04:56:51.788 --> 04:56:51.798 align:start position:0%
know ink still wet on my law license
 
04:56:54.070 --> 04:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
defending a guy against a huge Law Firm
 
04:56:57.270 --> 04:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
that had sued him because he put up a
 
04:56:59.788 --> 04:56:59.798 align:start position:0%
website complaining about the plants
 
04:57:01.470 --> 04:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
that his homeowners association had put
 
04:57:02.788 --> 04:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
up and saying that he found that they
 
04:57:04.310 --> 04:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
were ugly
 
04:57:05.910 --> 04:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
now that shouldn't put anybody in a
 
04:57:08.230 --> 04:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
courtroom or have anybody writing checks
 
04:57:11.470 --> 04:57:11.480 align:start position:0%
to a lawyer but the developer had a big
 
04:57:13.470 --> 04:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
ego and decided he wanted to shut down
 
04:57:16.150 --> 04:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
all descent and so we fought this big
 
04:57:19.708 --> 04:57:19.718 align:start position:0%
Law Firm it was in Florida we fought for
 
04:57:22.190 --> 04:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
a little over a year and boy was I proud
 
04:57:24.948 --> 04:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
when I got the ruling that I had won and
 
04:57:26.990 --> 04:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
I called him up ready to celebrate he
 
04:57:29.910 --> 04:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
said that's great kid if I won why is my
 
04:57:32.750 --> 04:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
retirement fund empty and uh you know
 
04:57:35.270 --> 04:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
boy was is that a a a real life lesson
 
04:57:36.830 --> 04:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
for a young lawyer they don't teach you
 
04:57:38.708 --> 04:57:38.718 align:start position:0%
that in law school that uh you know the
 
04:57:42.350 --> 04:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
real cost that can hurt somebody if
 
04:57:45.030 --> 04:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
somebody just brings a frivolous claim
 
04:57:47.628 --> 04:57:47.638 align:start position:0%
now the way that this bill is drafted
 
04:57:49.708 --> 04:57:49.718 align:start position:0%
it's going to create also one of the
 
04:57:51.350 --> 04:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
things that it does that a lot of the
 
04:57:53.670 --> 04:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
other ones don't is really just
 
04:57:56.150 --> 04:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
stylistic but it will work for to a
 
04:57:59.948 --> 04:57:59.958 align:start position:0%
great function and it separates your
 
04:58:02.430 --> 04:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
procedural parts from your substantive
 
04:58:02.440 --> 04:58:03.750 align:start position:0%
procedural parts from your substantive
parts

04:58:03.750 --> 04:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
parts
 
04:58:07.470 --> 04:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
uh California's is really the uh the the
 
04:58:11.510 --> 04:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
OG of anti-s slap laws um after
 
04:58:14.190 --> 04:58:14.200 align:start position:0%
California passed it Washington Oregon
 
04:58:16.670 --> 04:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
Nevada all followed Texas and as
 
04:58:18.390 --> 04:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
representative corkin said about 32
 
04:58:21.708 --> 04:58:21.718 align:start position:0%
states have one but you have a trend in
 
04:58:24.910 --> 04:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
the federal courts of not applying state
 
04:58:29.230 --> 04:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
anti-sap laws anymore uh I frankly think
 
04:58:31.990 --> 04:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
that the argument is foolish but uh it
 
04:58:33.670 --> 04:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
has taken hold
 
04:58:36.150 --> 04:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
that these laws are procedural and not
 
04:58:37.830 --> 04:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
substantive and that's because they run
 
04:58:40.070 --> 04:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
into one procedural element and the
 
04:58:42.190 --> 04:58:42.200 align:start position:0%
court says the whole thing is procedural
 
04:58:44.430 --> 04:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
well this disambiguates the substance
 
04:58:47.150 --> 04:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
from the procedure uh procedurally
 
04:58:50.150 --> 04:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
speaking it may stop for example stop
 
04:58:51.270 --> 04:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
Discovery in its
 
04:58:53.708 --> 04:58:53.718 align:start position:0%
tracks you can't legislate that in a
 
04:58:55.868 --> 04:58:55.878 align:start position:0%
federal court that's in the procedural
 
04:58:58.708 --> 04:58:58.718 align:start position:0%
section so if a federal court is looking
 
04:59:01.230 --> 04:59:01.240 align:start position:0%
at a lawsuit brought in violation of
 
04:59:03.270 --> 04:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
this section the federal court will be
 
04:59:05.910 --> 04:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
able to take that part and exclude it
 
04:59:08.350 --> 04:59:08.360 align:start position:0%
but really what it does is it creates a
 
04:59:12.310 --> 04:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
substantive immunity from suit and every
 
04:59:13.868 --> 04:59:13.878 align:start position:0%
word in that sentence is is in that
 
04:59:15.990 --> 04:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
phrase is doing work okay you want it to
 
04:59:19.590 --> 04:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
be substantive you want this to be a
 
04:59:22.190 --> 04:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
right that you are free from not just
 
04:59:23.990 --> 04:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
liability because if you're just free
 
04:59:24.000 --> 04:59:25.030 align:start position:0%
liability because if you're just free
from

04:59:25.030 --> 04:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:59:28.350 --> 04:59:28.360 align:start position:0%
liability uh I can tell you that judges
 
04:59:31.310 --> 04:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
are human beings uh they make mistakes
 
04:59:33.590 --> 04:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
they have biases uh
 
04:59:35.030 --> 04:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're they're downright
 
04:59:37.390 --> 04:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
hostile but let's think of you know I
 
04:59:39.070 --> 04:59:39.080 align:start position:0%
can think of a case that I handled where
 
04:59:43.030 --> 04:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
I was before frankly I think the best
 
04:59:45.350 --> 04:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
judge that that I know of um he's a
 
04:59:47.708 --> 04:59:47.718 align:start position:0%
wonderful man a principled man and he
 
04:59:51.150 --> 04:59:51.160 align:start position:0%
messed it up uh my client made a
 
04:59:53.150 --> 04:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
complaint to the real estate board in
 
04:59:55.868 --> 04:59:55.878 align:start position:0%
Nevada about her real estate agent uh
 
04:59:59.830 --> 04:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
had treated her in a racist Manner and
 
05:00:02.430 --> 05:00:02.440 align:start position:0%
he to retaliate filed a defamation
 
05:00:02.440 --> 05:00:03.990 align:start position:0%
he to retaliate filed a defamation
lawsuit

05:00:03.990 --> 05:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
05:00:06.150 --> 05:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
now there are two reasons why that just
 
05:00:08.548 --> 05:00:08.558 align:start position:0%
can't be one whether somebody's racist
 
05:00:10.430 --> 05:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
to you or not as a matter of opinion and
 
05:00:12.070 --> 05:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
two it's privileged if you're
 
05:00:14.708 --> 05:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
complaining in an official proceeding it
 
05:00:17.750 --> 05:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
didn't matter didn't matter to him and
 
05:00:19.430 --> 05:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
you know the trial judge uh I've never
 
05:00:21.030 --> 05:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
seen him make a mistake before but
 
05:00:23.750 --> 05:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
everybody's human he made a mistake now
 
05:00:26.070 --> 05:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
she would never have been able to defend
 
05:00:29.030 --> 05:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
herself without the Nevada anti-s slap
 
05:00:32.470 --> 05:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
law in place so what this does is not
 
05:00:34.830 --> 05:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
only does it give you a remedy but it
 
05:00:37.708 --> 05:00:37.718 align:start position:0%
creates an Avenue to access to justice
 
05:00:40.470 --> 05:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
that poor people frankly don't have you
 
05:00:43.350 --> 05:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
know I get calls every day for people
 
05:00:45.948 --> 05:00:45.958 align:start position:0%
who are being sued for speaking out and
 
05:00:47.430 --> 05:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
when it's in a state that I'm not
 
05:00:49.470 --> 05:00:49.480 align:start position:0%
licensed in I I call somebody in my
 
05:00:50.910 --> 05:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
network and I say do you want to take
 
05:00:52.390 --> 05:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
this person and they their first
 
05:00:54.070 --> 05:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
question is can they afford a
 
05:00:56.868 --> 05:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
retainer and the vast majority of people
 
05:00:58.910 --> 05:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
can't but in States where there's an
 
05:01:00.830 --> 05:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
anti-s slap law I have people fighting
 
05:01:03.750 --> 05:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
to take the case I mean imagine any any
 
05:01:06.270 --> 05:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
place else where you could have poor
 
05:01:08.470 --> 05:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
people getting fought over by somebody
 
05:01:10.868 --> 05:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
who makes hundreds and sometimes over
 
05:01:13.910 --> 05:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
,000 an hour to be their
 
05:01:17.910 --> 05:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
client so if you have any uh specific
 
05:01:19.830 --> 05:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
questions about the bill you know I've
 
05:01:22.350 --> 05:01:22.360 align:start position:0%
looked through it uh I think that it it
 
05:01:24.990 --> 05:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
makes a uh it makes a very good balance
 
05:01:27.750 --> 05:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
it frankly I will say it's not the
 
05:01:29.948 --> 05:01:29.958 align:start position:0%
strongest one that I've ever seen uh
 
05:01:32.070 --> 05:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
Washington state had one before that
 
05:01:32.080 --> 05:01:33.470 align:start position:0%
Washington state had one before that
required

05:01:33.470 --> 05:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
required
 
05:01:35.990 --> 05:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh clear and convincing evidence in
 
05:01:38.030 --> 05:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
order to get past it rather than mere
 
05:01:41.548 --> 05:01:41.558 align:start position:0%
Prima fascia evidence that was ruled in
 
05:01:43.510 --> 05:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
Washington to be a violation of that
 
05:01:46.590 --> 05:01:46.600 align:start position:0%
State's uh right to trial by jury so it
 
05:01:49.628 --> 05:01:49.638 align:start position:0%
was frankly a little too high test um
 
05:01:51.750 --> 05:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
this one has been dialed back from that
 
05:01:53.590 --> 05:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
standard to be similar to a summary
 
05:01:55.350 --> 05:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
judgment standard so that you don't have
 
05:01:57.910 --> 05:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
that problem um and the other
 
05:01:59.430 --> 05:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
perspective I'd like to make sure that
 
05:02:03.430 --> 05:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
you you have going into this is um last
 
05:02:06.030 --> 05:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
year I would say despite me sitting here
 
05:02:08.110 --> 05:02:08.120 align:start position:0%
you know waving my first amendment
 
05:02:10.868 --> 05:02:10.878 align:start position:0%
bonafides the majority of my income last
 
05:02:12.470 --> 05:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
year came from plaintiff's side
 
05:02:16.030 --> 05:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
defamation cases I am agnostic if
 
05:02:18.548 --> 05:02:18.558 align:start position:0%
somebody has been defamed somebody has
 
05:02:20.910 --> 05:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
had their reputation damaged uh and they
 
05:02:24.270 --> 05:02:24.280 align:start position:0%
have a supportable claim I have neither
 
05:02:26.150 --> 05:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
fear nor embarrassment of taking one of
 
05:02:29.270 --> 05:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
those cases and in fact I love taking
 
05:02:31.948 --> 05:02:31.958 align:start position:0%
them in states with anti- slap laws they
 
05:02:34.750 --> 05:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
do not create a speed bump for anybody
 
05:02:38.150 --> 05:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
except for I would say uh lawyers who do
 
05:02:41.190 --> 05:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
not know enough to look at a case and
 
05:02:44.230 --> 05:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
say you should not bring this so foolish
 
05:02:47.230 --> 05:02:47.240 align:start position:0%
lawyers um and unethical lawyers who may
 
05:02:49.430 --> 05:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
take one and say it doesn't matter let's
 
05:02:51.190 --> 05:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
do it
 
05:02:53.868 --> 05:02:53.878 align:start position:0%
anyway but I think that this bill will
 
05:02:55.510 --> 05:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
take if you look at the institute for
 
05:02:58.150 --> 05:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
free speeches map of anti-s slap law
 
05:03:01.788 --> 05:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
rankings uh right now New Hampshire has
 
05:03:06.548 --> 05:03:06.558 align:start position:0%
uh is red on that map it has an f um and
 
05:03:09.070 --> 05:03:09.080 align:start position:0%
while uh my native state of
 
05:03:10.708 --> 05:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts may be the Cradle of
 
05:03:12.628 --> 05:03:12.638 align:start position:0%
Liberty this is where Liberty
 
05:03:15.750 --> 05:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
lives so uh I think that you should pass
 
05:03:18.868 --> 05:03:18.878 align:start position:0%
this law in order to ensure that and if
 
05:03:20.390 --> 05:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
you have any questions for me about it
 
05:03:23.548 --> 05:03:23.558 align:start position:0%
uh I could talk about this all day
 
05:03:26.708 --> 05:03:26.718 align:start position:0%
long questions for this witness
 
05:03:28.590 --> 05:03:28.600 align:start position:0%
representative ter yeah just briefly
 
05:03:29.910 --> 05:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
thanks for bringing a wealth of
 
05:03:32.708 --> 05:03:32.718 align:start position:0%
knowledge um can I just ask are you uh
 
05:03:34.628 --> 05:03:34.638 align:start position:0%
here on your own behalf or are you with
 
05:03:36.788 --> 05:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
this particular group no I I am just
 
05:03:41.868 --> 05:03:41.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:45.430 --> 05:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
seed other questions for this witness
 
05:03:45.440 --> 05:03:46.708 align:start position:0%
seed other questions for this witness
representative

05:03:46.708 --> 05:03:46.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:03:48.948 --> 05:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
maners thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:03:51.070 --> 05:03:51.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I'm an
 
05:03:52.990 --> 05:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
attorney but I don't practice in this
 
05:03:55.030 --> 05:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
area I don't do civil litigation well I
 
05:03:57.910 --> 05:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
do divorces but anyway my question is
 
05:03:59.990 --> 05:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
why a motion for summary judgment or a
 
05:04:02.390 --> 05:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
motion to dismiss shouldn't end most of
 
05:04:02.400 --> 05:04:03.430 align:start position:0%
motion to dismiss shouldn't end most of
the

05:04:03.430 --> 05:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:04:07.110 --> 05:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
cases well they very well could um and
 
05:04:10.070 --> 05:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
if but here are the two problems one if
 
05:04:12.310 --> 05:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
I were to take a case here and file a
 
05:04:15.030 --> 05:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
motion to dismiss um that's not cheap
 
05:04:17.590 --> 05:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
it's not free summary judgment same
 
05:04:20.310 --> 05:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
thing but also if you have a substantive
 
05:04:22.990 --> 05:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
immunity from suit what happens when you
 
05:04:25.590 --> 05:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
have a a motion to dismiss that's denied
 
05:04:27.948 --> 05:04:27.958 align:start position:0%
well the case goes forward so all you
 
05:04:30.190 --> 05:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
need to do is plead it out uh if you
 
05:04:32.070 --> 05:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
have summary judgment that's denied
 
05:04:33.590 --> 05:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's not reviewable in an
 
05:04:36.868 --> 05:04:36.878 align:start position:0%
interlocutory basis so what winds up
 
05:04:39.708 --> 05:04:39.718 align:start position:0%
happening is look judges are human
 
05:04:43.430 --> 05:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
beings and if you can look at a case and
 
05:04:46.310 --> 05:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
say I can make a reviewable decision and
 
05:04:48.230 --> 05:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
rule in favor of the defendant on
 
05:04:50.310 --> 05:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
summary judgment or I can make a
 
05:04:52.708 --> 05:04:52.718 align:start position:0%
non-reviewable decision and say or at
 
05:04:54.510 --> 05:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
least not reviewable until the very end
 
05:04:57.470 --> 05:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
and deny it well then that litigant is
 
05:04:59.310 --> 05:04:59.320 align:start position:0%
still going along for the sixf figure
 
05:05:01.830 --> 05:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
ride and perhaps that can be reversed on
 
05:05:03.030 --> 05:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
appeal but
 
05:05:04.750 --> 05:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
not very many civil litigants can
 
05:05:07.708 --> 05:05:07.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:13.350 --> 05:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:16.390 --> 05:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
Smith um
 
05:05:19.150 --> 05:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
um I think I'm a little
 
05:05:19.160 --> 05:05:22.070 align:start position:0%
um I think I'm a little
speechless

05:05:22.070 --> 05:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
speechless
 
05:05:25.830 --> 05:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
because every single thing you talked
 
05:05:28.190 --> 05:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
about had a dollar
 
05:05:31.150 --> 05:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
sign every single thing whether you take
 
05:05:32.948 --> 05:05:32.958 align:start position:0%
a case whether you don't take a the case
 
05:05:34.990 --> 05:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
whether you get money who pays it who
 
05:05:37.430 --> 05:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't pay it
 
05:05:41.430 --> 05:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
um so is this just about money and by
 
05:05:43.190 --> 05:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
the way I do have to point out to you
 
05:05:45.788 --> 05:05:45.798 align:start position:0%
since you're not from this state that at
 
05:05:48.750 --> 05:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
least sitting on this committee is the
 
05:05:51.070 --> 05:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
uh one person who was the former uh
 
05:05:52.868 --> 05:05:52.878 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice of the New Hampshire
 
05:05:54.390 --> 05:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court I'm not going to tell you
 
05:05:56.548 --> 05:05:56.558 align:start position:0%
who but I just thought you might want to
 
05:05:59.190 --> 05:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
be careful about what you say in the
 
05:05:59.200 --> 05:06:01.390 align:start position:0%
be careful about what you say in the
future

05:06:01.390 --> 05:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
future
 
05:06:04.150 --> 05:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
um when they say it's not about the
 
05:06:06.110 --> 05:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
money it's about the
 
05:06:09.110 --> 05:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
money is there anything about this that
 
05:06:10.430 --> 05:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
you would talk about that doesn't have
 
05:06:13.110 --> 05:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
to do a bit with the money unfortunately
 
05:06:15.548 --> 05:06:15.558 align:start position:0%
that's it's the fuel of litigation I
 
05:06:18.708 --> 05:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
mean I look I certainly take pro bono
 
05:06:20.548 --> 05:06:20.558 align:start position:0%
defense cases where it just wouldn't
 
05:06:22.190 --> 05:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
matter if there was an anti-s slap at
 
05:06:24.708 --> 05:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
least to the litigant it's free for them
 
05:06:29.230 --> 05:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
anyway but money is the pressure that I
 
05:06:32.470 --> 05:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
think a plaintiff who brings a slap suit
 
05:06:34.470 --> 05:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
is going to use to bring to bear on that
 
05:06:36.750 --> 05:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
defendant you if you think if that
 
05:06:37.990 --> 05:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
defendant gets
 
05:06:40.510 --> 05:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
sued they're going to think do I need to
 
05:06:42.670 --> 05:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
mortgage my house to defend myself or
 
05:06:46.510 --> 05:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
should I just shut up so I look at it
 
05:06:49.230 --> 05:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
from that perspective but the money
 
05:06:51.230 --> 05:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
eventually leads to whether or not we
 
05:06:53.390 --> 05:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
have wide open and robust debate do we
 
05:06:57.430 --> 05:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
have a real free speech ecosystem or not
 
05:06:59.548 --> 05:06:59.558 align:start position:0%
so if somebody gets sued for something
 
05:07:01.628 --> 05:07:01.638 align:start position:0%
like this for example the the gentleman
 
05:07:03.390 --> 05:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
that I talked about in
 
05:07:05.510 --> 05:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
Florida do you think anybody else at
 
05:07:07.470 --> 05:07:07.480 align:start position:0%
that HOA ever spoke out again after
 
05:07:10.830 --> 05:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
seeing what happened to him they didn't
 
05:07:13.590 --> 05:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
not that I'm aware of uh the but you
 
05:07:16.030 --> 05:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
know the woman who spoke up in Nevada
 
05:07:18.830 --> 05:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
who was able to employ the anti-s slap
 
05:07:21.990 --> 05:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
law to protect her uh that created an
 
05:07:24.470 --> 05:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
ecosystem where people were happy to
 
05:07:25.948 --> 05:07:25.958 align:start position:0%
speak up if they wanted to about
 
05:07:28.990 --> 05:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
somebody being treated unethically so I
 
05:07:32.390 --> 05:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
I do understand sometimes you know uh
 
05:07:34.350 --> 05:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
there's more than just one lawyer on the
 
05:07:35.708 --> 05:07:35.718 align:start position:0%
on the committee here you know I think
 
05:07:38.350 --> 05:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
we uh perhaps sometimes we look at
 
05:07:40.030 --> 05:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
things in dollars and cents too much as
 
05:07:42.150 --> 05:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
lawyers you know you talk to a normal
 
05:07:44.150 --> 05:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
human being about a spine injury and
 
05:07:46.510 --> 05:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
everybody says oh that's terrible and a
 
05:07:48.750 --> 05:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
lawyer might go oh that's a good injury
 
05:07:51.270 --> 05:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh looking at it as a uh as as how
 
05:07:52.708 --> 05:07:52.718 align:start position:0%
expensive it might be of on a
 
05:07:55.990 --> 05:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
contingency fee case but really it's all
 
05:07:59.110 --> 05:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
about can somebody defend themselves
 
05:08:01.628 --> 05:08:01.638 align:start position:0%
this is this is The Shield that allows a
 
05:08:04.830 --> 05:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
regular person to be able to use their
 
05:08:07.868 --> 05:08:07.878 align:start position:0%
free speech rights and not be worried
 
05:08:09.470 --> 05:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be bankrupted just
 
05:08:10.910 --> 05:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
by defending
 
05:08:12.948 --> 05:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
themselves thank
 
05:08:17.110 --> 05:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
you other questions so I I guess I I
 
05:08:19.628 --> 05:08:19.638 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that I'm understanding
 
05:08:22.670 --> 05:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
one part can you am I understanding
 
05:08:25.390 --> 05:08:25.400 align:start position:0%
correctly that
 
05:08:29.190 --> 05:08:29.200 align:start position:0%
the the essence of whether the immunity
 
05:08:33.548 --> 05:08:33.558 align:start position:0%
applies or not is what the motivation of
 
05:08:37.110 --> 05:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff in the case is no sir it
 
05:08:40.670 --> 05:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
it is not um okay in fact Illinois had a
 
05:08:43.990 --> 05:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
a law that looked to that the first
 
05:08:45.390 --> 05:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
thing it looked to is what is the
 
05:08:48.510 --> 05:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
motivation and if you can't prove that
 
05:08:49.830 --> 05:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
if you couldn't prove that their
 
05:08:52.590 --> 05:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
motivation was to silence somebody if
 
05:08:54.948 --> 05:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
they were clever about it if they simply
 
05:08:57.070 --> 05:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
pled it in the right way well then it
 
05:08:59.190 --> 05:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
didn't apply effectively that turned
 
05:09:02.548 --> 05:09:02.558 align:start position:0%
Illinois's old anti-sap law uh into
 
05:09:04.548 --> 05:09:04.558 align:start position:0%
nothing more than words on paper it it
 
05:09:06.350 --> 05:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
was really never used again once the
 
05:09:08.430 --> 05:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
state supreme court interpreted it that
 
05:09:12.350 --> 05:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
way so no it's the effect not the intent
 
05:09:15.628 --> 05:09:15.638 align:start position:0%
so you may come into it with Innocent
 
05:09:17.830 --> 05:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
intentions but that's not what free
 
05:09:20.190 --> 05:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
speech is about is it we want we want to
 
05:09:23.670 --> 05:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
protect the citizens right to speak and
 
05:09:26.030 --> 05:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
if somebody simply brings the case
 
05:09:28.470 --> 05:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
because they're angry I'm not trying to
 
05:09:30.670 --> 05:09:30.680 align:start position:0%
shut them up I'm trying to express how
 
05:09:32.788 --> 05:09:32.798 align:start position:0%
angry I am well that's that's what the
 
05:09:34.910 --> 05:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
gentleman who was the plaintiff in that
 
05:09:38.070 --> 05:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh real estate case said but what what
 
05:09:41.510 --> 05:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
but if you're talking about I it sounded
 
05:09:43.310 --> 05:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
like in your answer when you say I
 
05:09:46.150 --> 05:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
brought the case because I was angry or
 
05:09:48.590 --> 05:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
I brought the case because I wanted to
 
05:09:51.150 --> 05:09:51.160 align:start position:0%
shut him up I mean isn't that a motive
 
05:09:52.948 --> 05:09:52.958 align:start position:0%
issue what what was the intent in
 
05:09:55.230 --> 05:09:55.240 align:start position:0%
bringing the case that's what I'm words
 
05:09:58.150 --> 05:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
I'm to to go back to the example of the
 
05:10:00.270 --> 05:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
the uh I think you the condominium I
 
05:10:01.670 --> 05:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
think you said with the big developer in
 
05:10:04.350 --> 05:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
Florida yes sir so the the the
 
05:10:06.430 --> 05:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
condominium owner
 
05:10:10.070 --> 05:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
says the plants here the plants in this
 
05:10:12.628 --> 05:10:12.638 align:start position:0%
in this condominium are you know they're
 
05:10:15.070 --> 05:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
terrible most awful plants I've ever
 
05:10:17.430 --> 05:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
seen it's you know it's and we're paying
 
05:10:20.030 --> 05:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
a huge monthly fee or whatever and this
 
05:10:21.788 --> 05:10:21.798 align:start position:0%
is all we get there you know a bunch of
 
05:10:24.548 --> 05:10:24.558 align:start position:0%
tulips I hate tulips or whatever they're
 
05:10:27.910 --> 05:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
terrible and so the developer the owner
 
05:10:29.670 --> 05:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
of the thing of the condom of the
 
05:10:31.390 --> 05:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
condominium complex or the developer
 
05:10:33.788 --> 05:10:33.798 align:start position:0%
whatever brings a suit against the
 
05:10:38.110 --> 05:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
person for defamation correct so I I
 
05:10:41.110 --> 05:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm I
 
05:10:43.708 --> 05:10:43.718 align:start position:0%
mean I guess what I'm having some
 
05:10:47.590 --> 05:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
difficulty is this if the if the to
 
05:10:52.070 --> 05:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
determine whether the whether the suit
 
05:10:56.390 --> 05:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
was brought because the developer really
 
05:10:59.670 --> 05:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
was you know worried about his
 
05:11:02.670 --> 05:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
reputation his reputation as a Bas based
 
05:11:06.310 --> 05:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
on the on the uh the comments of of the
 
05:11:10.070 --> 05:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
person who complained or was just trying
 
05:11:12.070 --> 05:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
to silence the person
 
05:11:14.708 --> 05:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
don't doesn't the judge have to decide
 
05:11:16.590 --> 05:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
or doesn't somebody have to decide what
 
05:11:18.830 --> 05:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
was the motivation for bringing the
 
05:11:21.750 --> 05:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
lawsuit not under any existing anti-s
 
05:11:24.230 --> 05:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
slap laws uh that that I'm aware of so
 
05:11:27.030 --> 05:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
then what so what the then what does the
 
05:11:29.230 --> 05:11:29.240 align:start position:0%
judge what does the judge make the
 
05:11:31.070 --> 05:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
decision based on the first step the
 
05:11:33.590 --> 05:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
judge makes is was the defendant
 
05:11:36.548 --> 05:11:36.558 align:start position:0%
exercising a First Amendment right
 
05:11:39.548 --> 05:11:39.558 align:start position:0%
that's just a simple yes or no and then
 
05:11:42.948 --> 05:11:42.958 align:start position:0%
it is whether or not the case is really
 
05:11:45.350 --> 05:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
to overly simplify it then the next step
 
05:11:48.788 --> 05:11:48.798 align:start position:0%
is well then is this case supportable uh
 
05:11:51.030 --> 05:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's somewhat whether or
 
05:11:53.190 --> 05:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
not the plaintiff had purity of heart at
 
05:11:55.270 --> 05:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
the time of filing it is irrelevant I
 
05:11:57.350 --> 05:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
mean really you know if you look at any
 
05:12:00.150 --> 05:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
case or really any conflict uh I think
 
05:12:03.910 --> 05:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
every combatant every every person who
 
05:12:06.430 --> 05:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
gets into a debate they always have an
 
05:12:08.548 --> 05:12:08.558 align:start position:0%
an argument that no my heart is pure I'm
 
05:12:10.310 --> 05:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
just defending my reputation as a
 
05:12:12.270 --> 05:12:12.280 align:start position:0%
developer who's going to want want to
 
05:12:14.910 --> 05:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
buy a unit here if my residents are
 
05:12:16.350 --> 05:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
complaining and
 
05:12:18.750 --> 05:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
discontent uh I think if you if you had
 
05:12:21.310 --> 05:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
a judge weighing the relative
 
05:12:24.910 --> 05:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
motivations of either party uh I don't
 
05:12:26.190 --> 05:12:26.200 align:start position:0%
think first of all I don't I don't think
 
05:12:28.430 --> 05:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
it would be constitutional to do so
 
05:12:31.270 --> 05:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
second I wouldn't support an anti-ap law
 
05:12:32.548 --> 05:12:32.558 align:start position:0%
that did that
 
05:12:33.948 --> 05:12:33.958 align:start position:0%
you know cuz remember the first
 
05:12:35.830 --> 05:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
amendment is not always there for nice
 
05:12:39.470 --> 05:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
people either in fact uh you know the
 
05:12:41.868 --> 05:12:41.878 align:start position:0%
most constitutional rights are uh are
 
05:12:44.070 --> 05:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
fought on grounds involving not very
 
05:12:46.750 --> 05:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
nice people um you know if you were to
 
05:12:49.190 --> 05:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
think about gosh some of the worst
 
05:12:51.270 --> 05:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
examples I can think of you know the
 
05:12:54.030 --> 05:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
Snider versus Phelps when uh you know
 
05:12:56.590 --> 05:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
poor guy was just trying to bury his kid
 
05:12:58.190 --> 05:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
and somebody came out and had these
 
05:13:02.070 --> 05:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
awful protest signs well do we look if
 
05:13:03.830 --> 05:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
we look at the relative motivations I'd
 
05:13:05.948 --> 05:13:05.958 align:start position:0%
say that the person with the awful
 
05:13:08.110 --> 05:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
protest signs had the most ill
 
05:13:10.670 --> 05:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
motivations but the first amendment is
 
05:13:12.270 --> 05:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
agnostic as to your
 
05:13:14.830 --> 05:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
feelings it's the function here that uh
 
05:13:17.948 --> 05:13:17.958 align:start position:0%
that's really important okay so I'm just
 
05:13:20.948 --> 05:13:20.958 align:start position:0%
I I I'm I I guess I'm looking on page
 
05:13:24.350 --> 05:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
two of the bill subsection f it says the
 
05:13:26.868 --> 05:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
immunity may only be overcome by a
 
05:13:28.470 --> 05:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
showing by the
 
05:13:31.030 --> 05:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs uh respondent or counter
 
05:13:33.230 --> 05:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs that the claim or counter
 
05:13:35.430 --> 05:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
claim is sufficient is of sufficient
 
05:13:39.548 --> 05:13:39.558 align:start position:0%
merit with primacia evidence um there's
 
05:13:39.558 --> 05:13:40.990 align:start position:0%
merit with primacia evidence um there's
a

05:13:40.990 --> 05:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:13:43.990 --> 05:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh there's a probability of prevailing
 
05:13:47.030 --> 05:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
on the claim or counter claim so I I
 
05:13:51.070 --> 05:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm mean does that mean that
 
05:13:53.670 --> 05:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
in my ex in the example of the
 
05:13:59.270 --> 05:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
Tulips the the uh if the if the
 
05:14:01.910 --> 05:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
developer does a developer have to show
 
05:14:04.708 --> 05:14:04.718 align:start position:0%
the judge you know these tulips really
 
05:14:06.628 --> 05:14:06.638 align:start position:0%
are good they really are very very
 
05:14:08.430 --> 05:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
pretty does the judge does that is that
 
05:14:11.350 --> 05:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
what the judge gets to decide on are the
 
05:14:15.030 --> 05:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
Tulips really are they really pretty um
 
05:14:17.510 --> 05:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
you're you're analyzing it improperly so
 
05:14:19.510 --> 05:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
the way that the judge would look at it
 
05:14:21.350 --> 05:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
first of all a judge doesn't ever
 
05:14:23.270 --> 05:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
neither a judge nor a jury would ever
 
05:14:25.230 --> 05:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
decide in a defamation case are the
 
05:14:28.150 --> 05:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
Tulips pretty that's a matter of opinion
 
05:14:30.350 --> 05:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
what the judge would say is this case
 
05:14:32.548 --> 05:14:32.558 align:start position:0%
has been brought because the developer
 
05:14:35.270 --> 05:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
is saying in his opinion the Tulips are
 
05:14:37.670 --> 05:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
pretty in the defendant's opinion
 
05:14:39.830 --> 05:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
they're not well there's no such thing
 
05:14:41.708 --> 05:14:41.718 align:start position:0%
as a false idea there's no such thing as
 
05:14:43.910 --> 05:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
a false opinion therefore as a matter of
 
05:14:46.910 --> 05:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
law this case is dismissed with costs
 
05:14:49.110 --> 05:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
and fees awarded to the defendant that's
 
05:14:50.590 --> 05:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
how that case would have ended right
 
05:14:52.390 --> 05:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
then and there if this law had been in
 
05:14:54.708 --> 05:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
place in Florida at the time why doesn't
 
05:14:59.990 --> 05:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
why doesn't the why under existing law
 
05:15:02.190 --> 05:15:02.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't the case end for the ly those
 
05:15:05.510 --> 05:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
reasons anyway if it did I neither I
 
05:15:07.030 --> 05:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be here and this wouldn't have
 
05:15:10.310 --> 05:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
happened in 32 other states it should uh
 
05:15:12.590 --> 05:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
it seems almost Unthinkable if you
 
05:15:14.230 --> 05:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
haven't been through this that this
 
05:15:16.590 --> 05:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
would ever happen but I can tell you it
 
05:15:19.510 --> 05:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
happens to people every day judges make
 
05:15:22.750 --> 05:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
mistakes you know and let's even you
 
05:15:24.590 --> 05:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
know you don't have elected judges here
 
05:15:26.470 --> 05:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
in your state courts but let me tell you
 
05:15:29.110 --> 05:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
if there's a 1200 lawyer firm arguing a
 
05:15:31.708 --> 05:15:31.718 align:start position:0%
motion to dismiss in a place where
 
05:15:34.310 --> 05:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a contested election
 
05:15:37.230 --> 05:15:37.240 align:start position:0%
that judge May simply say denied and
 
05:15:39.990 --> 05:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's all you get out of that judge um
 
05:15:41.390 --> 05:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
now not saying you're going to have that
 
05:15:43.190 --> 05:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire but your judges
 
05:15:46.190 --> 05:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
are not perfect you got good judges here
 
05:15:48.030 --> 05:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
but they're not perfect they make that
 
05:15:50.868 --> 05:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
mistake that mistake is $100,000 or so
 
05:15:54.070 --> 05:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
down Mr I don't like the tulip's throat
 
05:15:57.310 --> 05:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
so when it comes to most of these cases
 
05:16:00.310 --> 05:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
are brought over claims that as a matter
 
05:16:02.390 --> 05:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
of law are
 
05:16:04.590 --> 05:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
unsupportable just like you in your
 
05:16:06.628 --> 05:16:06.638 align:start position:0%
example whether there's an opinion or
 
05:16:09.310 --> 05:16:09.320 align:start position:0%
not uh if that's a matter of opinion
 
05:16:11.670 --> 05:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
that case should be over right there not
 
05:16:14.350 --> 05:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
proceed to Discovery not proceed pass
 
05:16:15.868 --> 05:16:15.878 align:start position:0%
the motion to dismiss because they've
 
05:16:18.110 --> 05:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
pled it well it's got to have at least
 
05:16:21.708 --> 05:16:21.718 align:start position:0%
praasa evidence which is a low standard
 
05:16:24.070 --> 05:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh and and it by Design it's a low
 
05:16:27.948 --> 05:16:27.958 align:start position:0%
standard um and that standard comes from
 
05:16:30.788 --> 05:16:30.798 align:start position:0%
uh multiple cases there there was one
 
05:16:32.708 --> 05:16:32.718 align:start position:0%
challenging the California standard
 
05:16:34.470 --> 05:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
which is that standard there was another
 
05:16:36.230 --> 05:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
one that challenged Nevadas which is
 
05:16:38.750 --> 05:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
that standard now and uh that's the new
 
05:16:40.948 --> 05:16:40.958 align:start position:0%
standard in Washington and that actually
 
05:16:44.070 --> 05:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
is the standard in uh I think every
 
05:16:48.430 --> 05:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:51.430 --> 05:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
Arizona uh representative Manos thank
 
05:16:53.430 --> 05:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
05:16:56.150 --> 05:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
question the example of the condo
 
05:16:57.948 --> 05:16:57.958 align:start position:0%
development and the Tulips which we've
 
05:16:59.948 --> 05:16:59.958 align:start position:0%
got going he only knew how famous he was
 
05:17:04.230 --> 05:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
now yes so I want to know um where is
 
05:17:06.190 --> 05:17:06.200 align:start position:0%
the governmental action that gets you to
 
05:17:08.990 --> 05:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
the first amendment in that situation
 
05:17:10.548 --> 05:17:10.558 align:start position:0%
well ever since New York Times versus
 
05:17:11.830 --> 05:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
Sullivan in
 
05:17:15.230 --> 05:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
1964 uh we have uh operated under the
 
05:17:16.868 --> 05:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
theory that the government actions the
 
05:17:18.910 --> 05:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
use of the courts in order to enforce
 
05:17:23.670 --> 05:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:27.230 --> 05:17:27.240 align:start position:0%

please Mr Chief I mean Mr chairman and

Mario Samy it is a hard act to follow
 
05:17:53.230 --> 05:17:53.240 align:start position:0%
Mark randazza I am an attorney in
 
05:17:54.430 --> 05:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
Connecticut a free speech lawyer in
 
05:17:56.830 --> 05:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
Connecticut I'm up here I actually have
 
05:17:59.628 --> 05:17:59.638 align:start position:0%
some clients who would or would would
 
05:18:01.470 --> 05:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
now or would have in the past benefited
 
05:18:02.948 --> 05:18:02.958 align:start position:0%
from this who
 
05:18:07.270 --> 05:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
are residents citizens of New Hampshire
 
05:18:09.708 --> 05:18:09.718 align:start position:0%
um I want to talk about I want to go
 
05:18:11.548 --> 05:18:11.558 align:start position:0%
straight to the Chairman's question you
 
05:18:13.230 --> 05:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
asked a very sophisticated technical
 
05:18:17.310 --> 05:18:17.320 align:start position:0%
question and I just want to follow up on
 
05:18:19.390 --> 05:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
it I had a case come through the door
 
05:18:20.788 --> 05:18:20.798 align:start position:0%
not too long ago which involved the
 
05:18:22.350 --> 05:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
woman who was a victim of sexual abuse
 
05:18:25.670 --> 05:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
and she was being sued by her uh
 
05:18:27.750 --> 05:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
attacker because of statements she made
 
05:18:29.628 --> 05:18:29.638 align:start position:0%
on social media that he alleged were
 
05:18:31.030 --> 05:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
false and they were not on the face of
 
05:18:32.390 --> 05:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
it false were there was not they were
 
05:18:34.110 --> 05:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
non-falsifiable statements they couldn't
 
05:18:36.190 --> 05:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
be sustained at the end say we get all
 
05:18:37.548 --> 05:18:37.558 align:start position:0%
the way down the line to summary
 
05:18:41.430 --> 05:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
judgment we would have won she could not
 
05:18:43.910 --> 05:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
pay me upfront what would normally be
 
05:18:45.750 --> 05:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
required of a retainer but I could take
 
05:18:48.070 --> 05:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
that I could I wouldn't even be able to
 
05:18:49.990 --> 05:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
consider taking that case but
 
05:18:51.670 --> 05:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
Connecticut has a pretty strong anti-s
 
05:18:55.150 --> 05:18:55.160 align:start position:0%
slap statute so in that case I'm just
 
05:18:56.390 --> 05:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
going to get in the weeds with you a
 
05:18:59.030 --> 05:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
little bit here so when you have to put
 
05:19:01.830 --> 05:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
on a prima fascia case early on
 
05:19:03.190 --> 05:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
are you a fact-based pleading state or
 
05:19:05.548 --> 05:19:05.558 align:start position:0%
are you a notice based pleading State uh
 
05:19:07.910 --> 05:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
pretty much notice okay so it's enough
 
05:19:09.788 --> 05:19:09.798 align:start position:0%
for them to say this person lied about
 
05:19:11.948 --> 05:19:11.958 align:start position:0%
me in these ways on these things these
 
05:19:13.590 --> 05:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
these the in the internet this person
 
05:19:15.150 --> 05:19:15.160 align:start position:0%
lied about me on the internet and this
 
05:19:18.070 --> 05:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
caused me harm okay in our state you
 
05:19:19.150 --> 05:19:19.160 align:start position:0%
have to even get a little bit more into
 
05:19:20.830 --> 05:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
the facts but it it would be sufficient
 
05:19:23.830 --> 05:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
to to pass early motions to dismiss or
 
05:19:25.708 --> 05:19:25.718 align:start position:0%
we call motions to strike if you just
 
05:19:27.150 --> 05:19:27.160 align:start position:0%
say hey this person lied about me in
 
05:19:29.110 --> 05:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
these ways and caused me harm you don't
 
05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
actually have to say the exact
 
05:19:32.750 --> 05:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
statements you don't have to identify
 
05:19:36.390 --> 05:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
exactly what the LIE the supposed lie
 
05:19:38.548 --> 05:19:38.558 align:start position:0%
was what the those words were so you
 
05:19:41.190 --> 05:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
can't attack them early on in the same
 
05:19:42.910 --> 05:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
way you're suggesting as a matter of law
 
05:19:44.510 --> 05:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
this doesn't sustain this can't be
 
05:19:46.270 --> 05:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
sustained because it's just a matter of
 
05:19:47.628 --> 05:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
opinion why doesn't this get kicked out
 
05:19:49.190 --> 05:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
early on because of the way pleadings
 
05:19:50.788 --> 05:19:50.798 align:start position:0%
work so the person would have to go all
 
05:19:53.430 --> 05:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
the way through Discovery with all that
 
05:19:56.788 --> 05:19:56.798 align:start position:0%
all the expenses of depositions and
 
05:19:58.910 --> 05:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
electronic Discovery and so on and most
 
05:20:01.190 --> 05:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
people they can't even get past the
 
05:20:03.350 --> 05:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
first motion let alone the possibility
 
05:20:04.990 --> 05:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
of going all the way down that way and
 
05:20:06.788 --> 05:20:06.798 align:start position:0%
then having to go to a trial and then
 
05:20:08.628 --> 05:20:08.638 align:start position:0%
having to take an appeal and so
 
05:20:11.548 --> 05:20:11.558 align:start position:0%
on it's it's not even can't even think
 
05:20:12.510 --> 05:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
about they don't they can barely make
 
05:20:13.910 --> 05:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
their car payment these people some of
 
05:20:18.230 --> 05:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
these people so uh what the person would
 
05:20:20.868 --> 05:20:20.878 align:start position:0%
have to do the um I'm going to call the
 
05:20:23.230 --> 05:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
Mal the bad guy in this case I'm just
 
05:20:25.190 --> 05:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
going to presume it for the moment he
 
05:20:27.390 --> 05:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
would have to in order to sustain
 
05:20:28.990 --> 05:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
himself pass the special motion to
 
05:20:31.430 --> 05:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
dismiss early on he'd have to make an
 
05:20:34.628 --> 05:20:34.638 align:start position:0%
affidavit saying this is what she said
 
05:20:37.390 --> 05:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
that isn't true now even if that gets
 
05:20:38.830 --> 05:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
past the special motion to dismiss
 
05:20:41.150 --> 05:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
strategically that is very useful he's
 
05:20:44.150 --> 05:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
locked in early on he can't wait for the
 
05:20:45.788 --> 05:20:45.798 align:start position:0%
convenience later on after discover's
 
05:20:47.150 --> 05:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
gone on to come up with some cutesy
 
05:20:49.110 --> 05:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
story way down the line he's got to say
 
05:20:51.310 --> 05:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
at the start this is what you're saying
 
05:20:54.830 --> 05:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
ma'am that's a lie and that's for for I
 
05:20:57.910 --> 05:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
got to say that was really valuable to
 
05:20:59.390 --> 05:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
force him to put him in that position
 
05:21:00.628 --> 05:21:00.638 align:start position:0%
hey guy I'm going to put you on the
 
05:21:02.310 --> 05:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
stand you're going to have to you're
 
05:21:04.070 --> 05:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
going to have to put up evidence early
 
05:21:05.708 --> 05:21:05.718 align:start position:0%
on in Connecticut we could have put them
 
05:21:07.270 --> 05:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
on the stand here you just have to you
 
05:21:08.470 --> 05:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
just have to have an affidavit or
 
05:21:10.548 --> 05:21:10.558 align:start position:0%
something to sustain that burden but you
 
05:21:11.670 --> 05:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
have to put some you have to put
 
05:21:14.030 --> 05:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
something down you can you have to risk
 
05:21:16.670 --> 05:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
perjuring yourself or risk changing your
 
05:21:19.430 --> 05:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
story later on you're locked in that's
 
05:21:22.310 --> 05:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
really a very valuable strategic tool
 
05:21:24.628 --> 05:21:24.638 align:start position:0%
that isn't apparent that kind of way
 
05:21:26.470 --> 05:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
that scenario plays out that's not
 
05:21:27.910 --> 05:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
apparent in the text of this bill
 
05:21:30.110 --> 05:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of this this bill is an
 
05:21:31.788 --> 05:21:31.798 align:start position:0%
amazing piece of social technology that
 
05:21:35.990 --> 05:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
has evolved through 30 years of anti-sap
 
05:21:38.830 --> 05:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
litigation and development in law and
 
05:21:40.190 --> 05:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
watching how other states mess up
 
05:21:42.310 --> 05:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
including my own State Connecticut lots
 
05:21:44.270 --> 05:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
of state and watching them evolve uh
 
05:21:45.948 --> 05:21:45.958 align:start position:0%
attorney randazza helped draft this and
 
05:21:48.110 --> 05:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
he did this is a really fine piece
 
05:21:50.670 --> 05:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of technical pieces here
 
05:21:52.548 --> 05:21:52.558 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to address any of them that
 
05:21:54.230 --> 05:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
may not be apparent on the face of it
 
05:21:55.750 --> 05:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
why is this why do we have this
 
05:21:58.868 --> 05:21:58.878 align:start position:0%
substantive versus procedural piece I I
 
05:22:00.670 --> 05:22:00.680 align:start position:0%

about some of the people that this bill
 
05:22:17.230 --> 05:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
will help in my practice I'm not Mark
 
05:22:19.390 --> 05:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
extremely successful I'm I'm a tier at
 
05:22:21.390 --> 05:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
least one tier down right I drive a
 
05:22:23.670 --> 05:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
Subaru because it's good in the snow
 
05:22:26.350 --> 05:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
like I'm not you know I own one car
 
05:22:29.190 --> 05:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
that's you know I'm not a I'm not a I I
 
05:22:31.110 --> 05:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
have a managing member of my firm I'm I
 
05:22:32.750 --> 05:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
don't get to call the shots I he gets to
 
05:22:34.190 --> 05:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
say whether you know this is a problem
 
05:22:35.708 --> 05:22:35.718 align:start position:0%
or not so I have to prove to him that I
 
05:22:40.430 --> 05:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
have a decent case right so uh some I I
 
05:22:42.430 --> 05:22:42.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned the sex assault victim and I
 
05:22:45.230 --> 05:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
am sure that that story is not unique to
 
05:22:47.190 --> 05:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
you know to Connecticut I'm sure you
 
05:22:48.830 --> 05:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
that thing can happen in New Hampshire
 
05:22:50.990 --> 05:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure it does now you just don't
 
05:22:54.110 --> 05:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
see it you don't see the people this
 
05:22:56.510 --> 05:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
helps you don't see the lawsuits that
 
05:22:59.070 --> 05:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
don't happen you don't see the people
 
05:23:01.868 --> 05:23:01.878 align:start position:0%
who shut up it's it's not visible I'm
 
05:23:03.350 --> 05:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
telling you it does happen because I
 
05:23:05.670 --> 05:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
hear these stories as I said I had a
 
05:23:09.070 --> 05:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
couple people from from New Hampshire
 
05:23:13.708 --> 05:23:13.718 align:start position:0%
um these are both of them are uh YouTube
 
05:23:15.868 --> 05:23:15.878 align:start position:0%
content creators they are investigative
 
05:23:18.910 --> 05:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
journalists of a style one of them uh
 
05:23:20.990 --> 05:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
makes more long form content like
 
05:23:25.310 --> 05:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
documentaries the other uh substantive
 
05:23:27.310 --> 05:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
content like an hourong long form things
 
05:23:31.670 --> 05:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
about corruption or about um
 
05:23:33.510 --> 05:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
fraud that they have
 
05:23:33.520 --> 05:23:36.670 align:start position:0%
fraud that they have
identified

05:23:36.670 --> 05:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:40.788 --> 05:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
and one of them did get sued and that
 
05:23:43.150 --> 05:23:43.160 align:start position:0%
was and I had to explain to him how much
 
05:23:44.310 --> 05:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
it was going to cost him for me to
 
05:23:47.150 --> 05:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
defend it and ended up referring him to
 
05:23:50.628 --> 05:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
another firm and another one we I had
 
05:23:52.470 --> 05:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
him because we expected for him to
 
05:23:53.948 --> 05:23:53.958 align:start position:0%
possibly get sued by a person he had to
 
05:23:55.948 --> 05:23:55.958 align:start position:0%
move his business and his intellectual
 
05:23:57.948 --> 05:23:57.958 align:start position:0%
property to a more favorable state with
 
05:23:59.670 --> 05:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
a better anti- slap law with an actual
 
05:24:01.590 --> 05:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
anti-s slap law I said set it up over in
 
05:24:02.788 --> 05:24:02.798 align:start position:0%
Connecticut just move we'll have your
 
05:24:04.150 --> 05:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
intellectual property owned by your
 
05:24:05.830 --> 05:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
business by a business in Connecticut
 
05:24:07.310 --> 05:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
you can pay Connecticut taxes okay what
 
05:24:10.670 --> 05:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
have you I but you because there was no
 
05:24:14.910 --> 05:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
anti-s slap bill here it was a terrible
 
05:24:16.548 --> 05:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
idea for him to try to defend himself
 
05:24:19.310 --> 05:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
from a defamation suit in in New
 
05:24:21.030 --> 05:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not withstanding the fact he
 
05:24:22.030 --> 05:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
was writing a really interesting
 
05:24:24.350 --> 05:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
documentary about this kind of this
 
05:24:25.910 --> 05:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
piece of fraud I don't want to identify
 
05:24:29.470 --> 05:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
my client um and so that's how we he did
 
05:24:32.390 --> 05:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
so now he's guys a concut business uh I
 
05:24:34.910 --> 05:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
would after this I would consider
 
05:24:36.548 --> 05:24:36.558 align:start position:0%
becoming barred in New Hampshire because
 
05:24:38.910 --> 05:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
this is and doing the exact opposite
 
05:24:42.070 --> 05:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
this is a very strong a very useful
 
05:24:44.430 --> 05:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
instrument this bill uh to helping to
 
05:24:45.708 --> 05:24:45.718 align:start position:0%
protect those kinds of people now these
 
05:24:48.868 --> 05:24:48.878 align:start position:0%
are little guys uh right so they they
 
05:24:50.390 --> 05:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
also aren't driving around with fancy
 
05:24:51.910 --> 05:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
cars they're they're they're not making
 
05:24:54.390 --> 05:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
six digits but they are doing adding to
 
05:24:57.350 --> 05:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
the discourse in America in a way that
 
05:24:59.868 --> 05:24:59.878 align:start position:0%
uh is really valuable they can reach
 
05:25:02.070 --> 05:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
different kinds of a es people can and
 
05:25:05.708 --> 05:25:05.718 align:start position:0%
they bring even on things like uh
 
05:25:08.548 --> 05:25:08.558 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency and a lot of things so
 
05:25:09.990 --> 05:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
they they're interesting topics that I
 
05:25:12.070 --> 05:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
think are valuable in their speech um
 
05:25:13.430 --> 05:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
those are so those are some of the
 
05:25:15.990 --> 05:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
people who this bill will
 
05:25:19.948 --> 05:25:19.958 align:start position:0%
protect right question I'm sorry mean to
 
05:25:21.070 --> 05:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
interrupt you you have I thought you
 
05:25:22.830 --> 05:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
were I thought you were done no no no no
 
05:25:24.110 --> 05:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh well I was going to talk about some
 
05:25:25.430 --> 05:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
of the value for the people of State of
 
05:25:27.708 --> 05:25:27.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you know law this is about
 
05:25:30.070 --> 05:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
lawyers policing lawyers here the only
 
05:25:31.470 --> 05:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
people who should be be afraid of this
 
05:25:35.628 --> 05:25:35.638 align:start position:0%
bill are bad or bad lawyers who are
 
05:25:37.590 --> 05:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
acting in bad faith there is one in
 
05:25:40.070 --> 05:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
there's one in my area who I encounter
 
05:25:42.750 --> 05:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
several times um sometimes my clients
 
05:25:44.110 --> 05:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
can't necessarily Avail themselves they
 
05:25:45.590 --> 05:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
come to me too late to be able to Avail
 
05:25:46.910 --> 05:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
themselves of the anti connetic anti
 
05:25:48.390 --> 05:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
slap statute so sometimes he gets around
 
05:25:50.868 --> 05:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
it in that way but he the he's usually
 
05:25:53.110 --> 05:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
just trying to shake down someone's
 
05:25:55.230 --> 05:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
homeowners insurance for a few th000
 
05:25:57.150 --> 05:25:57.160 align:start position:0%
he's got a garbage suit but they'll you
 
05:25:58.788 --> 05:25:58.798 align:start position:0%
know the insurance company will will
 
05:26:02.270 --> 05:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
settle if there is insurance
 
05:26:05.030 --> 05:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
um but this is about this doesn't cost
 
05:26:06.788 --> 05:26:06.798 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire anything
 
05:26:09.190 --> 05:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
this is just lawyers policing lawyers
 
05:26:14.708 --> 05:26:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:17.150 --> 05:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
um you know and another thing with these
 
05:26:19.628 --> 05:26:19.638 align:start position:0%
cases a lot of nonprofits don't take
 
05:26:22.190 --> 05:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
these kinds of speech cases uh these
 
05:26:24.310 --> 05:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
defamation speech cases because there's
 
05:26:26.548 --> 05:26:26.558 align:start position:0%
you can't package it right in order to
 
05:26:28.548 --> 05:26:28.558 align:start position:0%
get people to help you out so a lot of
 
05:26:31.150 --> 05:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
this kind of free speech defense really
 
05:26:34.310 --> 05:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
does fall on the on private attorneys um
 
05:26:36.590 --> 05:26:36.600 align:start position:0%

05:26:38.310 --> 05:26:38.320 align:start position:0%

wish it did because I have that that is
 
05:27:14.948 --> 05:27:14.958 align:start position:0%
a problem we have in Connecticut too
 
05:27:16.110 --> 05:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
well the followup on that is the reason
 
05:27:17.430 --> 05:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
why is it because in the analysis it
 
05:27:19.750 --> 05:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
says uh this bill establishes legal
 
05:27:21.350 --> 05:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
process for preventing strategic
 
05:27:23.670 --> 05:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
lawsuits against public participation as
 
05:27:26.750 --> 05:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity from suit prosecution
 
05:27:29.350 --> 05:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
and from liability for any so I'm I'm
 
05:27:32.310 --> 05:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
that that word prosecution implies to me
 
05:27:33.948 --> 05:27:33.958 align:start position:0%
that the district attorney decides that
 
05:27:35.670 --> 05:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
they don't like me they just want to
 
05:27:37.470 --> 05:27:37.480 align:start position:0%
bring a suit against me to shut me up
 
05:27:38.948 --> 05:27:38.958 align:start position:0%
for some
 
05:27:40.990 --> 05:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
reason can you just direct me to which
 
05:27:42.548 --> 05:27:42.558 align:start position:0%
paragraph you were talking about just on
 
05:27:44.990 --> 05:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
the analis ah I believe a prosecution
 
05:27:46.030 --> 05:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
means in the way that one might
 
05:27:47.628 --> 05:27:47.638 align:start position:0%
prosecute a lawsuit doesn't necessarily
 
05:27:49.708 --> 05:27:49.718 align:start position:0%
mean in a criminal manner it means I
 
05:27:50.990 --> 05:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
believe in this context they're
 
05:27:53.310 --> 05:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
referring to when I bring a lawsuit and
 
05:27:54.910 --> 05:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
I try to follow it all the way through
 
05:27:58.910 --> 05:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
that is to prosecute a lawsuit so uh I
 
05:28:02.430 --> 05:28:02.440 align:start position:0%
don't believe this this applies to Mark
 
05:28:04.470 --> 05:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
I don't believe this applies to any uh
 
05:28:06.910 --> 05:28:06.920 align:start position:0%
government officials speech you would be
 
05:28:09.590 --> 05:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
wrong I'm wrong yes I appreciate that I
 
05:28:11.270 --> 05:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate the correction this is why
 
05:28:14.190 --> 05:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
you drive the Subaru right this is why I
 
05:28:16.190 --> 05:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
and just so you know I drive a Subaru
 
05:28:18.230 --> 05:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
too with 200,000 miles on it and the
 
05:28:21.070 --> 05:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
check engine light is
 
05:28:24.430 --> 05:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
on Fair all right so I appreciate the
 
05:28:27.110 --> 05:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
correction that's uh
 
05:28:29.670 --> 05:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
I I I would we had such a spill in
 
05:28:32.590 --> 05:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
Connecticut I would wish we did um any
 
05:28:35.190 --> 05:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
other questions I may address other
 
05:28:37.628 --> 05:28:37.638 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness seeing none
 
05:28:40.110 --> 05:28:40.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you so
 
05:28:43.628 --> 05:28:43.638 align:start position:0%
much next uh I'm G to call
 
05:28:47.868 --> 05:28:47.878 align:start position:0%
on uh Elizabeth
 
05:28:53.590 --> 05:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:56.830 --> 05:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
yes good afternoon again Mr chairman and
 
05:28:59.708 --> 05:28:59.718 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um I just want
 
05:29:01.868 --> 05:29:01.878 align:start position:0%
to clarify because I was here earlier in
 
05:29:03.590 --> 05:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
my professional capacity that this
 
05:29:05.788 --> 05:29:05.798 align:start position:0%
afternoon I am here in my personal
 
05:29:08.510 --> 05:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
capacity um so for the record my name is
 
05:29:10.868 --> 05:29:10.878 align:start position:0%
Lisa Brit solski Stevens and I am a
 
05:29:14.548 --> 05:29:14.558 align:start position:0%
resident of conquered um the chief
 
05:29:16.788 --> 05:29:16.798 align:start position:0%
proponent of anti- slap legislation
 
05:29:19.190 --> 05:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
you've heard from Mar and daza is a dear
 
05:29:22.788 --> 05:29:22.798 align:start position:0%
and very old friend of mine um it is
 
05:29:24.868 --> 05:29:24.878 align:start position:0%
funny for many of us who lived in the
 
05:29:27.110 --> 05:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
same dorm at UMass Amherst to think that
 
05:29:29.430 --> 05:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
he has used his tremendous intellectual
 
05:29:31.510 --> 05:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
gifts to to become a preeminent First
 
05:29:33.350 --> 05:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment lawyer but he
 
05:29:35.510 --> 05:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
has and his Fidelity to the first
 
05:29:37.070 --> 05:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
amendment I think you gathered is
 
05:29:39.830 --> 05:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
unmatched and it's non
 
05:29:42.110 --> 05:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
partisan like any friend of longstanding
 
05:29:44.030 --> 05:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
Mark has made me laugh and cry has
 
05:29:45.510 --> 05:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
introduced me to new ideas and
 
05:29:48.430 --> 05:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
experiences and has saved my
 
05:29:50.470 --> 05:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
bacon I think this bill is something of
 
05:29:52.788 --> 05:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
a legislative unicorn its purpose and
 
05:29:54.868 --> 05:29:54.878 align:start position:0%
goals both appeal to so-called
 
05:29:56.830 --> 05:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional conservatives as well as
 
05:29:59.030 --> 05:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
those leaning left or far
 
05:30:01.830 --> 05:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
left the laws passed these laws have
 
05:30:03.510 --> 05:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
passed some of the most liberal and some
 
05:30:07.390 --> 05:30:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:10.670 --> 05:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
nation I think one thing that in my
 
05:30:14.510 --> 05:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
research and my tutorials from Mark um
 
05:30:16.830 --> 05:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
there is that question of motivation
 
05:30:18.948 --> 05:30:18.958 align:start position:0%
maybe not relevant to the judicial
 
05:30:21.110 --> 05:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
analysis but it sort of speaks to the
 
05:30:23.948 --> 05:30:23.958 align:start position:0%
origin of these cases that many of these
 
05:30:25.910 --> 05:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
defamation cases are brought by people
 
05:30:28.430 --> 05:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
who have no expectation of
 
05:30:32.548 --> 05:30:32.558 align:start position:0%
winning and I would offer as a local
 
05:30:34.548 --> 05:30:34.558 align:start position:0%
example and I don't know how this would
 
05:30:36.708 --> 05:30:36.718 align:start position:0%
have played out if we had strong
 
05:30:40.230 --> 05:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
anti-sap legislation on the books but
 
05:30:41.868 --> 05:30:41.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Public Radio has spent
 
05:30:44.270 --> 05:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
several years defending litigation based
 
05:30:46.190 --> 05:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
on reporting that their journalists have
 
05:30:47.910 --> 05:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
done award-winning
 
05:30:50.110 --> 05:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
journalism from somebody who didn't like
 
05:30:51.990 --> 05:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
the content and didn't like the
 
05:30:55.548 --> 05:30:55.558 align:start position:0%
reflection of their work they have spent
 
05:31:00.750 --> 05:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
many many dollars to defend their work
 
05:31:02.910 --> 05:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
that they could have spent on
 
05:31:04.948 --> 05:31:04.958 align:start position:0%
programming I would much rather listen
 
05:31:07.628 --> 05:31:07.638 align:start position:0%
to the folk show on Sunday evening
 
05:31:09.628 --> 05:31:09.638 align:start position:0%
knowing that they don't have the burden
 
05:31:13.150 --> 05:31:13.160 align:start position:0%
of frivolous litigation so that to me is
 
05:31:15.750 --> 05:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
a very personal and
 
05:31:20.070 --> 05:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
local explanation of how this might go
 
05:31:22.230 --> 05:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
differently in the presence of anti-s
 
05:31:25.788 --> 05:31:25.798 align:start position:0%
slap legislation in New Hampshire um in
 
05:31:28.190 --> 05:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
my research I've also seen
 
05:31:31.510 --> 05:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
that these laws are protective of
 
05:31:33.830 --> 05:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
victims of Domestic and Sexual Violence
 
05:31:36.990 --> 05:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
and trafficking um the the courts are
 
05:31:39.750 --> 05:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
used as an instrument of further abuse
 
05:31:42.390 --> 05:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
for such victims this prevents that
 
05:31:45.830 --> 05:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:48.708 --> 05:31:48.718 align:start position:0%
abuse I am not the expert you've heard
 
05:31:51.628 --> 05:31:51.638 align:start position:0%
from people far more expert than me I'm
 
05:31:53.430 --> 05:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
not positioned to say that this bill
 
05:31:57.230 --> 05:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
goes too far or not far enough my ask of
 
05:31:59.548 --> 05:31:59.558 align:start position:0%
the committee is that you give it a fome
 
05:31:59.558 --> 05:32:00.628 align:start position:0%
the committee is that you give it a fome
review

05:32:00.628 --> 05:32:00.638 align:start position:0%
review
 
05:32:03.110 --> 05:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
have a fome debate and make whatever
 
05:32:05.510 --> 05:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
amendments you think are necessary to
 
05:32:08.190 --> 05:32:08.200 align:start position:0%
ensure that New Hampshire is not without
 
05:32:09.948 --> 05:32:09.958 align:start position:0%
any anti-s slap
 
05:32:12.910 --> 05:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
protection I'm thankful for your time I
 
05:32:15.070 --> 05:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
could answer questions but probably not
 
05:32:17.750 --> 05:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
well questions for this witness
 
05:32:17.760 --> 05:32:18.990 align:start position:0%
well questions for this witness
representative

05:32:18.990 --> 05:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:32:21.390 --> 05:32:21.400 align:start position:0%
Smith and I just want to remind you of
 
05:32:23.990 --> 05:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
course you do not have to answer the
 
05:32:27.948 --> 05:32:27.958 align:start position:0%
question you could say you don't know um
 
05:32:33.070 --> 05:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
I don't didn't understand your reference
 
05:32:33.080 --> 05:32:37.750 align:start position:0%
I don't didn't understand your reference
um

05:32:37.750 --> 05:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:41.628 --> 05:32:41.638 align:start position:0%
uh you talked about who would benefit in
 
05:32:44.230 --> 05:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and you
 
05:32:47.788 --> 05:32:47.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned trafficking and I I don't get
 
05:32:49.670 --> 05:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
the connection can you help make a
 
05:32:52.230 --> 05:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
connection for me I will do my best and
 
05:32:55.470 --> 05:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
if I falter Mark will help me but
 
05:32:58.470 --> 05:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
essentially perpetrators of abuse and
 
05:33:01.990 --> 05:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
violence and trafficking King will use
 
05:33:05.548 --> 05:33:05.558 align:start position:0%
the court to retaliate against their
 
05:33:08.868 --> 05:33:08.878 align:start position:0%
victims who are trying to get protection
 
05:33:11.150 --> 05:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
from supportive entities if they maybe
 
05:33:13.708 --> 05:33:13.718 align:start position:0%
out somebody um there is a lot of
 
05:33:15.590 --> 05:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
literature about how this could have
 
05:33:17.910 --> 05:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
been helpful in the Harvey
 
05:33:20.548 --> 05:33:20.558 align:start position:0%
Weinstein hundreds of cases where
 
05:33:22.590 --> 05:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
initially he was sort of standing on his
 
05:33:24.110 --> 05:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
reputation and saying this can't
 
05:33:26.350 --> 05:33:26.360 align:start position:0%
possibly be true and people with
 
05:33:28.030 --> 05:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
legitimate complaints were not able to
 
05:33:30.030 --> 05:33:30.040 align:start position:0%
bring them forward because of the
 
05:33:32.470 --> 05:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
expense even though he knew he had
 
05:33:35.430 --> 05:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
perpetrated those
 
05:33:38.590 --> 05:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
crimes other questions for this witness
 
05:33:40.030 --> 05:33:40.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you so much
 
05:33:53.868 --> 05:33:53.878 align:start position:0%

please good afternoon attorney sufit
 
05:33:59.548 --> 05:33:59.558 align:start position:0%
from Franklin representing Hampshire
 
05:34:02.548 --> 05:34:02.558 align:start position:0%
associ iation for
 
05:34:06.670 --> 05:34:06.680 align:start position:0%
justice I know some of my audience here
 
05:34:09.628 --> 05:34:09.638 align:start position:0%
and I got this bill yesterday Marissa
 
05:34:11.948 --> 05:34:11.958 align:start position:0%
said look at this bill tell me what's
 
05:34:15.628 --> 05:34:15.638 align:start position:0%
wrong with it um what I'm but I'm what
 
05:34:19.548 --> 05:34:19.558 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing from the proponents of it is
 
05:34:22.788 --> 05:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
that this is going to weaponize the
 
05:34:25.628 --> 05:34:25.638 align:start position:0%
other side the side that wants to
 
05:34:28.628 --> 05:34:28.638 align:start position:0%
purport to Be invoking Free Speech
 
05:34:32.030 --> 05:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
rights that if you go against that Free
 
05:34:35.190 --> 05:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
Speech rights and they sue then they
 
05:34:38.190 --> 05:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
have substi of immunity and then if you
 
05:34:41.190 --> 05:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
lose in the the person who is using this
 
05:34:44.788 --> 05:34:44.798 align:start position:0%
anti-s slap they get um punitive damages
 
05:34:47.070 --> 05:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
did we did you read that and the we
 
05:34:50.030 --> 05:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
don't have punitive damages in New
 
05:34:53.390 --> 05:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um but that that's what it
 
05:34:57.750 --> 05:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
says and again I read it quickly but um
 
05:35:03.990 --> 05:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:06.070 --> 05:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page
 
05:35:06.080 --> 05:35:07.628 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page
four

05:35:07.628 --> 05:35:07.638 align:start position:0%
four
 
05:35:11.670 --> 05:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
is the the one who is using the this new
 
05:35:14.868 --> 05:35:14.878 align:start position:0%
legislation this anti-s slap first gets
 
05:35:17.110 --> 05:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
the case dismissed because they have
 
05:35:19.830 --> 05:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
substantive immunity then brings a
 
05:35:23.590 --> 05:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
second suit against using the anti-s
 
05:35:26.910 --> 05:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
slap get statutory damages of no less
 
05:35:30.788 --> 05:35:30.798 align:start position:0%
than 100,000 WS compensatory damage
 
05:35:34.350 --> 05:35:34.360 align:start position:0%
and additional damages calculated to
 
05:35:38.310 --> 05:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
deter the other side pled from bringing
 
05:35:38.320 --> 05:35:39.430 align:start position:0%
deter the other side pled from bringing
that's

05:35:39.430 --> 05:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:35:41.868 --> 05:35:41.878 align:start position:0%
punitive and then it actually uses
 
05:35:45.990 --> 05:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
punitive near the bottom uh the line 26
 
05:35:49.390 --> 05:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
of the last page if they bring in a case
 
05:35:51.628 --> 05:35:51.638 align:start position:0%
and I didn't understand how this works
 
05:35:55.510 --> 05:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
is if the they're using the anti-s slap
 
05:35:58.390 --> 05:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
in a foreign jurisdiction so another
 
05:36:01.270 --> 05:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
state and they win there somehow they
 
05:36:04.270 --> 05:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
can get statutory damages of 10 to
 
05:36:06.750 --> 05:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
100,000 um attorney's fees and then
 
05:36:08.750 --> 05:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
bullet for punitive
 
05:36:11.708 --> 05:36:11.718 align:start position:0%
damages um I mean just New Hampshire's
 
05:36:14.310 --> 05:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
got a long history that that we don't
 
05:36:16.670 --> 05:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
allow punitive damages you have actual
 
05:36:19.830 --> 05:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
damages so this is basically a a game
 
05:36:22.628 --> 05:36:22.638 align:start position:0%
Cher against our jurist prudence and
 
05:36:25.350 --> 05:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
then I'm wondering if the proponents
 
05:36:27.590 --> 05:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
have read the recent Supreme New
 
05:36:30.590 --> 05:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court case of Dan Hind
 
05:36:33.270 --> 05:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
um some of you probably know him because
 
05:36:38.030 --> 05:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
he sits in this body yeah and if um the
 
05:36:39.990 --> 05:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
ne Hampshire Democratic party and
 
05:36:42.788 --> 05:36:42.798 align:start position:0%
Raymond Buckley had the benefit of this
 
05:36:46.948 --> 05:36:46.958 align:start position:0%
anti-s slap when Dan sued and and the
 
05:36:48.990 --> 05:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Democratic party would say oh
 
05:36:52.548 --> 05:36:52.558 align:start position:0%
we have uh we have immunity here and and
 
05:36:55.030 --> 05:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
if they would have won with that statute
 
05:36:57.830 --> 05:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
um then Buckley and the Hampshire
 
05:37:00.070 --> 05:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
Democratic party would have gone after
 
05:37:02.590 --> 05:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
representative Hines for these punitive
 
05:37:06.628 --> 05:37:06.638 align:start position:0%
damages um and these $10,000 to $100,000
 
05:37:09.310 --> 05:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
damages ladies and gentlemen that is a
 
05:37:12.310 --> 05:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
chilling a chilling chilling effect that
 
05:37:16.110 --> 05:37:16.120 align:start position:0%
this statute would bring to NE Hampshire
 
05:37:18.548 --> 05:37:18.558 align:start position:0%
and you know somebody asked the question
 
05:37:20.470 --> 05:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
well is this an attorney's
 
05:37:24.190 --> 05:37:24.200 align:start position:0%
bill you know attorney's fees and cost I
 
05:37:26.830 --> 05:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
I think it is kind of an attorney's
 
05:37:29.070 --> 05:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
free-for-all if we would have passed
 
05:37:30.110 --> 05:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
this here
 
05:37:33.670 --> 05:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
and and the immunity word is like I
 
05:37:35.310 --> 05:37:35.320 align:start position:0%
don't know eight or 10 times in the
 
05:37:37.548 --> 05:37:37.558 align:start position:0%
statute immunity immunity qualified
 
05:37:39.470 --> 05:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
immunity qualified immunity qualified
 
05:37:41.430 --> 05:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
immunity qualified immunity I mean
 
05:37:43.868 --> 05:37:43.878 align:start position:0%
they're seeking to get some sort of
 
05:37:46.830 --> 05:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
immunity um in New Hampshire so I leave
 
05:37:49.990 --> 05:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
you with this is you know we are dealing
 
05:37:53.310 --> 05:37:53.320 align:start position:0%
with two constitutional rights here
 
05:37:56.830 --> 05:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
right and in our state
 
05:38:00.030 --> 05:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
constitution we have part one article
 
05:38:03.110 --> 05:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
20 that the right to a jury trial for
 
05:38:05.670 --> 05:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
the jury of our peers to decide
 
05:38:09.628 --> 05:38:09.638 align:start position:0%
cases that right shall be held
 
05:38:12.230 --> 05:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
sacred that's what the frame is of our
 
05:38:14.830 --> 05:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution the right to
 
05:38:19.150 --> 05:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
have a jury of our decide cases shall be
 
05:38:22.310 --> 05:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
sacred that's not even in the US
 
05:38:25.590 --> 05:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution right to a jury trial um in
 
05:38:28.230 --> 05:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
article 7 so the Hampshire takes that
 
05:38:31.470 --> 05:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
right as a a sacred right to have a jury
 
05:38:34.468 --> 05:38:34.478 align:start position:0%
of our peers resolve cases and I
 
05:38:35.830 --> 05:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
understand that the freedom of the press
 
05:38:39.788 --> 05:38:39.798 align:start position:0%
is also a very high U right in this case
 
05:38:43.070 --> 05:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
because we say that in article 22 part
 
05:38:46.070 --> 05:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
one that the free speech and Liberty of
 
05:38:49.190 --> 05:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
the press are essential to the security
 
05:38:51.468 --> 05:38:51.478 align:start position:0%
of freedom in the state they ought
 
05:38:54.788 --> 05:38:54.798 align:start position:0%
therefore to be inv viably
 
05:38:57.350 --> 05:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
preserved you don't see those words in
 
05:39:01.430 --> 05:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
our other rights in our state consti
 
05:39:04.390 --> 05:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
so we have long Juris Prudence in this
 
05:39:07.070 --> 05:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
state when we're balancing these two
 
05:39:10.510 --> 05:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
high orders of freedoms that we cherish
 
05:39:13.830 --> 05:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
in this state and this anti- slap seems
 
05:39:13.840 --> 05:39:14.750 align:start position:0%
in this state and this anti- slap seems
to

05:39:14.750 --> 05:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:39:18.430 --> 05:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
elevate this um freedom of
 
05:39:21.628 --> 05:39:21.638 align:start position:0%
expression over our sacred right of
 
05:39:24.830 --> 05:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
having a jury of our peers decide
 
05:39:27.670 --> 05:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
disputes and and that's just not the
 
05:39:31.510 --> 05:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
hampire way um so I understand that
 
05:39:34.830 --> 05:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
there's a this is a national push and I
 
05:39:38.670 --> 05:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
understand that um um Mar razzer is
 
05:39:40.830 --> 05:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
behind writing this legislation that's
 
05:39:42.830 --> 05:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
what Mario shery said that he was
 
05:39:44.390 --> 05:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
instrumental in drafting this
 
05:39:47.750 --> 05:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
legislation for the Hampshire
 
05:39:50.190 --> 05:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
um we can deal with our own problems
 
05:39:51.990 --> 05:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire we don't need
 
05:39:53.830 --> 05:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
Outsiders coming in and telling us what
 
05:39:56.868 --> 05:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
to do never have um we don't have this
 
05:39:58.628 --> 05:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
problem here in New Hampshire our
 
05:40:00.070 --> 05:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
05:40:02.230 --> 05:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
dealt with Dan Hines and the New
 
05:40:04.548 --> 05:40:04.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Democratic party in a very
 
05:40:07.830 --> 05:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
even way and they looked at our
 
05:40:10.270 --> 05:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution and our statutes and they
 
05:40:12.548 --> 05:40:12.558 align:start position:0%
came out with a very principal decision
 
05:40:15.750 --> 05:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
this anti- slap would basically overrule
 
05:40:19.070 --> 05:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
that that's nothing a h
 
05:40:22.030 --> 05:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
away questions for this witness
 
05:40:22.040 --> 05:40:23.670 align:start position:0%
away questions for this witness
representative

05:40:23.670 --> 05:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:40:27.150 --> 05:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
Smith um thank you very much I've been
 
05:40:30.190 --> 05:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
waiting to find someone who I can ask
 
05:40:30.200 --> 05:40:30.990 align:start position:0%
waiting to find someone who I can ask
this

05:40:30.990 --> 05:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:40:34.510 --> 05:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
question um I have always had difficulty
 
05:40:36.708 --> 05:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
personally with the the concept of
 
05:40:36.718 --> 05:40:38.270 align:start position:0%
personally with the the concept of
qualified

05:40:38.270 --> 05:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
05:40:41.788 --> 05:40:41.798 align:start position:0%
immunity which I see as a license to
 
05:40:43.868 --> 05:40:43.878 align:start position:0%
behave in a way
 
05:40:46.750 --> 05:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
that other people might not be permitted
 
05:40:52.468 --> 05:40:52.478 align:start position:0%
to behave can you tell me how qualified
 
05:40:56.350 --> 05:40:56.360 align:start position:0%
immunity I I read it in this bill but I
 
05:40:58.788 --> 05:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
couldn't figure out how it would work
 
05:41:02.670 --> 05:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
can help me I'm not sure I can because
 
05:41:05.510 --> 05:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
when I well when I read the
 
05:41:08.390 --> 05:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
legislation there's another problem that
 
05:41:10.230 --> 05:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
is very similar to what you bring up
 
05:41:14.350 --> 05:41:14.360 align:start position:0%
representative Smith is on page
 
05:41:17.230 --> 05:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
two paragraph
 
05:41:20.830 --> 05:41:20.840 align:start position:0%
F this immunity may only be
 
05:41:25.070 --> 05:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
overcome by showing d da d d da DT so it
 
05:41:29.708 --> 05:41:29.718 align:start position:0%
basically G the immunity is is um
 
05:41:32.830 --> 05:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
presumed until it's proven otherwise and
 
05:41:36.150 --> 05:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
then and um our former Chief Justice can
 
05:41:39.548 --> 05:41:39.558 align:start position:0%
talk to this um unless must show the
 
05:41:43.350 --> 05:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
claim can survive a motion to dismiss or
 
05:41:45.590 --> 05:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
a motion for summary judgment well those
 
05:41:47.788 --> 05:41:47.798 align:start position:0%
are two different tests we know in court
 
05:41:49.708 --> 05:41:49.718 align:start position:0%
you know motion to dismiss is on the
 
05:41:52.670 --> 05:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
pleadings is there a factual is enough
 
05:41:55.230 --> 05:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
factual stuff in the pleading to survive
 
05:41:56.788 --> 05:41:56.798 align:start position:0%
a motion to summary judgment is
 
05:41:58.548 --> 05:41:58.558 align:start position:0%
basically after some evidence is in you
 
05:41:59.750 --> 05:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
weigh the evidence
 
05:42:01.230 --> 05:42:01.240 align:start position:0%
those are two different standards I'm
 
05:42:04.708 --> 05:42:04.718 align:start position:0%
not sure what this legislation meant as
 
05:42:06.830 --> 05:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
that standard why they drafted it that
 
05:42:11.110 --> 05:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
way it it is confusing um so for for all
 
05:42:13.590 --> 05:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
of those reasons I I understand the
 
05:42:15.510 --> 05:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
proponents of this National move have
 
05:42:17.230 --> 05:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
helped draft this legislation here in
 
05:42:17.240 --> 05:42:18.350 align:start position:0%
helped draft this legislation here in
New

05:42:18.350 --> 05:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
New
 
05:42:21.830 --> 05:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it it needs a lot of study it
 
05:42:24.230 --> 05:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
needs a lot of study and and I don't
 
05:42:28.030 --> 05:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
think we take that as a a sort of uh
 
05:42:30.390 --> 05:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
pencil Whip approv It today without
 
05:42:33.070 --> 05:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
really looking deep into the covers
 
05:42:35.430 --> 05:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
here before we're going change questions
 
05:42:37.070 --> 05:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
for this

05:43:39.350 --> 05:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:41.110 --> 05:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
05:43:43.708 --> 05:43:43.718 align:start position:0%
committee um so by way of background
 
05:43:46.150 --> 05:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
basically this statute I'm trying to
 
05:43:48.390 --> 05:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
overturn uh the Court's decision
 
05:43:51.270 --> 05:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
perspectively in state bily um so that
 
05:43:55.150 --> 05:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
was a case I brought back in 2018 where
 
05:43:57.310 --> 05:43:57.320 align:start position:0%
um basically women were charged for
 
05:44:00.430 --> 05:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
being topless on a beach and the court
 
05:44:02.750 --> 05:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
um ultimately in a 3-2 decision um
 
05:44:05.510 --> 05:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
upheld that ordinance um I'll just quote
 
05:44:09.190 --> 05:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
from the uh finding basically the
 
05:44:10.990 --> 05:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
majority's reason was that the ordinance
 
05:44:13.788 --> 05:44:13.798 align:start position:0%
does not classify on the basis of gender
 
05:44:15.230 --> 05:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
um because it prohibits both men and
 
05:44:18.430 --> 05:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
women from Being Ned um so my statute
 
05:44:20.868 --> 05:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
would essentially overrule that decision
 
05:44:22.548 --> 05:44:22.558 align:start position:0%
um so New Hampshire as you may know is
 
05:44:24.830 --> 05:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
not a home Ru state so what that means
 
05:44:27.788 --> 05:44:27.798 align:start position:0%
is towns and cities can only do what the
 
05:44:29.990 --> 05:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
legislature says they can can and so
 
05:44:32.948 --> 05:44:32.958 align:start position:0%
this statute is um essentially
 
05:44:36.150 --> 05:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
prohibiting towns from doing that so the
 
05:44:38.430 --> 05:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
state if they want they can step in and
 
05:44:40.708 --> 05:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
it's called preemption we can make a law
 
05:44:43.030 --> 05:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
that tells Town specifically you cannot
 
05:44:44.708 --> 05:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
do something that's what this bill is
 
05:44:46.590 --> 05:44:46.600 align:start position:0%
it's preempting Bill it would prohibit
 
05:44:49.070 --> 05:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
cities towns and unincorporated places
 
05:44:51.070 --> 05:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
from discriminating or distinguishing
 
05:44:54.270 --> 05:44:54.280 align:start position:0%
based on race or sex um now offand I
 
05:44:56.190 --> 05:44:56.200 align:start position:0%
can't think of any ordinances that do
 
05:44:58.548 --> 05:44:58.558 align:start position:0%
discriminate on Race um I hope there are
 
05:45:01.030 --> 05:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
none but on the chance that there are I
 
05:45:03.030 --> 05:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
think it's important that we tell towns
 
05:45:05.830 --> 05:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
do not do that and the same with sex I
 
05:45:08.430 --> 05:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
do not think an element of a charge or a
 
05:45:10.910 --> 05:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
crime should be the sex of a person I
 
05:45:12.590 --> 05:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
think it's very inappropriate and this
 
05:45:15.708 --> 05:45:15.718 align:start position:0%
bill would essentially remedy that and
 
05:45:18.110 --> 05:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
um so the words the reason I have
 
05:45:21.070 --> 05:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
discriminate or distinguished in my um
 
05:45:23.310 --> 05:45:23.320 align:start position:0%
bill is specifically to address the
 
05:45:26.070 --> 05:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
courts language in state V Lily um that
 
05:45:28.910 --> 05:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
dealt with classifications so just to be
 
05:45:30.548 --> 05:45:30.558 align:start position:0%
perfectly clear if the court were to
 
05:45:32.708 --> 05:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
look at this again to look at um
 
05:45:34.868 --> 05:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
legislative intent my intent is very
 
05:45:38.190 --> 05:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
specifically to overrule that case and
 
05:45:39.830 --> 05:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
essentially that is what this bill would
 
05:45:42.070 --> 05:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
do um if there are other instances of
 
05:45:44.990 --> 05:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
the state or not the state of towns or
 
05:45:47.590 --> 05:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
cities essentially discriminating on
 
05:45:49.910 --> 05:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
basis of sex it would also make those
 
05:45:53.548 --> 05:45:53.558 align:start position:0%
statutes um void and unenforceable and
 
05:45:56.030 --> 05:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions on
 
05:45:59.788 --> 05:45:59.798 align:start position:0%
this questions for this Witness
 
05:46:02.990 --> 05:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
could I ask just one question um do you
 
05:46:06.070 --> 05:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
differentiate between sex and gender I
 
05:46:08.030 --> 05:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
did not
 
05:46:11.070 --> 05:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
um I know some people use those words
 
05:46:13.270 --> 05:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
interchangeably um unfortunately our
 
05:46:15.910 --> 05:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
human rights um or basically our law
 
05:46:17.910 --> 05:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
against discrimination also somewhat
 
05:46:20.430 --> 05:46:20.440 align:start position:0%
uses those words interchangeably um so I
 
05:46:23.750 --> 05:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
do not if the committee wants to put in
 
05:46:25.270 --> 05:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
amendment I think I would be supportive
 
05:46:27.430 --> 05:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
of that I think it further complicates
 
05:46:30.788 --> 05:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
the issue um it's gonna my opinion then
 
05:46:32.830 --> 05:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
you might want to address the difference
 
05:46:34.150 --> 05:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
between sex and gend I think just
 
05:46:36.230 --> 05:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
further complicates an issue so no I am
 
05:46:39.390 --> 05:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
specifically only only dealing with
 
05:46:42.788 --> 05:46:42.798 align:start position:0%
sex other questions for this
 
05:46:48.030 --> 05:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you thank you
 
05:46:53.670 --> 05:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna call on Anie Malachi
 
05:47:05.830 --> 05:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:07.430 --> 05:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon to the chair and the
 
05:47:09.830 --> 05:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much um my name
 
05:47:12.430 --> 05:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
is Anie Malachi I am the executive
 
05:47:15.230 --> 05:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
director of The Human Rights Commission
 
05:47:17.230 --> 05:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
um the commission was asked to do a
 
05:47:19.628 --> 05:47:19.638 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and we certainly would not
 
05:47:22.270 --> 05:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
know how many calls that we would get um
 
05:47:24.310 --> 05:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
I think the larger issue for the
 
05:47:28.190 --> 05:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
commission is that uh we whether it's
 
05:47:30.868 --> 05:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
public accommodation which this would
 
05:47:33.750 --> 05:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
cover um or if the city or the town was
 
05:47:36.708 --> 05:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
an employer um all of those locations
 
05:47:39.670 --> 05:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
are pre are currently covered under the
 
05:47:41.230 --> 05:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
Discrimination law or the
 
05:47:42.788 --> 05:47:42.798 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination law that we have
 
05:47:45.310 --> 05:47:45.320 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire um and by singling
 
05:47:50.150 --> 05:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
out or specifying race or sex um the
 
05:47:52.030 --> 05:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
question would be does that mean the
 
05:47:54.910 --> 05:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
other areas of the law are not
 
05:47:59.270 --> 05:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
applicable and if so why not so um
 
05:48:01.310 --> 05:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
there's quite a bit of
 
05:48:04.830 --> 05:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
confusion for for me uh relative to this
 
05:48:07.510 --> 05:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
information and it would it's not
 
05:48:10.390 --> 05:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
helpful to eliminate other areas where
 
05:48:12.510 --> 05:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
there could be discrimination relative
 
05:48:14.788 --> 05:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
to a city or a town as a place of public
 
05:48:17.830 --> 05:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
accommodation or even as an employer so
 
05:48:21.750 --> 05:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:24.990 --> 05:48:25.000 align:start position:0%

of uh HB
 
06:16:42.110 --> 06:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
1037 uh and that's because in our legal
 
06:16:45.990 --> 06:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
system we have two types of law we have
 
06:16:47.750 --> 06:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
criminal law that enforces public
 
06:16:50.590 --> 06:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
Justice it punishes people who break our
 
06:16:54.030 --> 06:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
laws the second type of law civil law
 
06:16:56.030 --> 06:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
can also punish wrongdoers but in
 
06:16:57.430 --> 06:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
instead of sending them to jail or
 
06:16:59.708 --> 06:16:59.718 align:start position:0%
finding them civil law seeks to
 
06:17:01.390 --> 06:17:01.400 align:start position:0%
compensate a victim for the harm they
 
06:17:03.708 --> 06:17:03.718 align:start position:0%
have endured as a result of the actions
 
06:17:04.788 --> 06:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
of a
 
06:17:07.548 --> 06:17:07.558 align:start position:0%
wrongdoer a doctor who botches a surgery
 
06:17:10.310 --> 06:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
can get sued for malpractice a car
 
06:17:12.670 --> 06:17:12.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturer can be sued for installing
 
06:17:14.990 --> 06:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
faulty ignition switches and airbags
 
06:17:17.350 --> 06:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
that lead to Deaths and the injuries of

the opposite of

06:18:15.110 --> 06:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
law recognizes that there are on
 
06:18:17.788 --> 06:18:17.798 align:start position:0%
occasion some very limited circumstances
 
06:18:20.350 --> 06:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
where it can enhance the public interest
 
06:18:21.868 --> 06:18:21.878 align:start position:0%

that has a real public

06:19:36.628 --> 06:19:36.638 align:start position:0%

Commerce that's extremely broadly
 
06:20:09.830 --> 06:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
defined in effect what this law does is
 
06:20:12.708 --> 06:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
Shield an extremely profitable industry
 
06:20:15.150 --> 06:20:15.160 align:start position:0%
from facing basic Financial incentives
 
06:20:17.708 --> 06:20:17.718 align:start position:0%
to better protect public health and
 
06:20:20.910 --> 06:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
safety no other industry has this sort
 
06:20:23.030 --> 06:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
of blanket protection from civil
 
06:20:25.750 --> 06:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
liability in New Hampshire law which
 
06:20:27.708 --> 06:20:27.718 align:start position:0%
raises a really critical
 
06:20:30.350 --> 06:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
question what exactly is the public
 
06:20:33.310 --> 06:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
benefit of giving one industry special
 
06:20:35.390 --> 06:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
treatment and does it outweigh the
 
06:20:37.830 --> 06:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
interests of victims and their
 
06:20:40.190 --> 06:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
families the simple fact is that laws
 
06:20:42.270 --> 06:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
that limit the liability of an entire
 
06:20:45.350 --> 06:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
industry discourage
 
06:20:48.310 --> 06:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
lawsuits in this case they also reward
 
06:20:51.510 --> 06:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
and quietly encourage negligence in the
 
06:20:54.390 --> 06:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
manufacturing selling marketing and
 
06:20:56.750 --> 06:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
importing of firearms in related
 
06:20:59.750 --> 06:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
products they also discourage
 
06:21:01.628 --> 06:21:01.638 align:start position:0%
potentially life-saving
 
06:21:04.270 --> 06:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
Innovations I'll give you an example of
 
06:21:07.310 --> 06:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
that the idea for so-called smart guns
 
06:21:10.150 --> 06:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
has been around for decades these are
 
06:21:12.030 --> 06:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
guns that have biometric sensors that
 
06:21:13.750 --> 06:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
can detect whether the person holding
 
06:21:16.190 --> 06:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
the gun is the person the gun actually
 
06:21:19.868 --> 06:21:19.878 align:start position:0%
belongs to a Smart Gun Won't fire for
 
06:21:21.350 --> 06:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
anyone but the
 
06:21:24.350 --> 06:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
owner widespread sales of smart guns
 
06:21:26.110 --> 06:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
could save hundreds of children from
 
06:21:28.510 --> 06:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
accidental shootings and also dozens of
 
06:21:30.230 --> 06:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
police officers who have their firearms
 
06:21:34.750 --> 06:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
rested away from them uh in contact with
 
06:21:37.830 --> 06:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
offenders only one company right now a
 
06:21:40.670 --> 06:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
startup company offers a firearm like
 
06:21:42.750 --> 06:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
this to sell for the for sale by the
 
06:21:47.190 --> 06:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
public um so why exactly is
 
06:21:51.548 --> 06:21:51.558 align:start position:0%
that it's because there is no incentive
 
06:21:53.708 --> 06:21:53.718 align:start position:0%
to invest in safety Innovations like
 
06:21:56.708 --> 06:21:56.718 align:start position:0%
smart gun technology when any liability
 
06:21:59.270 --> 06:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
that you face has been shrunken down to
 
06:22:03.310 --> 06:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
a size so small you can drown it in a
 
06:22:06.430 --> 06:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
bathtub the question is not about
 
06:22:09.230 --> 06:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
supporting the Second Amendment it's
 
06:22:11.948 --> 06:22:11.958 align:start position:0%
about special treatment for an entire
 
06:22:14.670 --> 06:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
industry it's also about fairness to the
 
06:22:15.990 --> 06:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
hundreds of other New Hampshire
 
06:22:19.230 --> 06:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturers who do not enjoy this
 
06:22:20.708 --> 06:22:20.718 align:start position:0%
similar degree of
 
06:22:23.430 --> 06:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
protection and finally it's about basic
 
06:22:25.070 --> 06:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
accountability for victims and their
 
06:22:27.390 --> 06:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
families who should always under our
 
06:22:29.750 --> 06:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
system have the opportunity to prove
 
06:22:32.430 --> 06:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
their case in a court of law unless
 
06:22:36.788 --> 06:22:36.798 align:start position:0%
there is a compelling public interest at
 
06:22:40.830 --> 06:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
stake I also wanted to uh to mention a
 
06:22:43.190 --> 06:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
kind of a brief postcript to the story
 
06:22:45.070 --> 06:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
um earlier this week the New Hampshire
 
06:22:47.468 --> 06:22:47.478 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit that
 
06:22:49.510 --> 06:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
was filed by two police officers against
 
06:22:52.270 --> 06:22:52.280 align:start position:0%
a gun shop owner the officers were shot
 
06:22:54.468 --> 06:22:54.478 align:start position:0%
during a gas station robbery and uh the
 
06:22:56.708 --> 06:22:56.718 align:start position:0%
officers claimed in their lawsuit that
 
06:22:58.070 --> 06:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
the shooter should have been blocked
 
06:22:59.670 --> 06:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
from purchasing a gun because of
 
06:23:02.510 --> 06:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
previous mental health issues but citing
 
06:23:04.708 --> 06:23:04.718 align:start position:0%
the statute the Court ruled that there
 
06:23:06.830 --> 06:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
was no liability on the part of the gun
 
06:23:06.840 --> 06:23:07.590 align:start position:0%
was no liability on the part of the gun
store

06:23:07.590 --> 06:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
store
 
06:23:09.628 --> 06:23:09.638 align:start position:0%
owner a lawyer for the Attorney
 
06:23:12.190 --> 06:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
General's office was quoted in the WMUR
 
06:23:13.310 --> 06:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
story as
 
06:23:15.670 --> 06:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
follows it's good to know that the gun
 
06:23:17.310 --> 06:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
industry in New Hampshire will now be
 
06:23:19.750 --> 06:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
able to have this protection going
 
06:23:23.270 --> 06:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
forward but apparently it's also okay
 
06:23:25.230 --> 06:23:25.240 align:start position:0%
that this special protection for the gun
 
06:23:27.590 --> 06:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
indust industry comes at the expense of
 
06:23:29.628 --> 06:23:29.638 align:start position:0%
police officers and the safety of
 
06:23:30.750 --> 06:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
06:23:34.230 --> 06:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
public changing this is why I'm here
 
06:23:36.190 --> 06:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
before you today and I'll be happy to
 
06:23:40.510 --> 06:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:43.628 --> 06:23:43.638 align:start position:0%
have represent
 
06:23:45.948 --> 06:23:45.958 align:start position:0%
K thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
06:23:49.230 --> 06:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I guess I just I
 
06:23:50.548 --> 06:23:50.558 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that I'm understanding
 
06:23:53.110 --> 06:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
something correctly so I understand why
 
06:23:54.990 --> 06:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
for example a car manufacturer be
 
06:23:57.350 --> 06:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
respons if say they were aware that
 
06:23:58.830 --> 06:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
there was potentially a faulty break
 
06:24:00.628 --> 06:24:00.638 align:start position:0%
issue and that they still sold the car
 
06:24:03.708 --> 06:24:03.718 align:start position:0%
anyway because they wanted to have quick
 
06:24:06.150 --> 06:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
sales um and then that person got in an
 
06:24:08.030 --> 06:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
accident and somebody died I understand
 
06:24:10.468 --> 06:24:10.478 align:start position:0%
why they'd be liable for that however
 
06:24:12.190 --> 06:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be liable if the person
 
06:24:14.510 --> 06:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
just decided that they wanted to drive
 
06:24:16.430 --> 06:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
their car into a river that's not the
 
06:24:18.750 --> 06:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
liability of the manufacturer so I guess
 
06:24:21.590 --> 06:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
my question is is currently is a
 
06:24:25.750 --> 06:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturer responsible if the fire arm
 
06:24:28.510 --> 06:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
is is faulty somehow in that they knew
 
06:24:30.708 --> 06:24:30.718 align:start position:0%
that there was uh you know as part of
 
06:24:33.390 --> 06:24:33.400 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing that there had been an
 
06:24:35.110 --> 06:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
issue and that potentially it may cause
 
06:24:38.708 --> 06:24:38.718 align:start position:0%
it to misfire somehow I would they be I
 
06:24:40.750 --> 06:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
understand the reason why we would want
 
06:24:43.628 --> 06:24:43.638 align:start position:0%
liability for that is that what you're
 
06:24:45.150 --> 06:24:45.160 align:start position:0%
is isn't there currently already
 
06:24:47.150 --> 06:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
liability for that there is liability
 
06:24:49.190 --> 06:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
for for product defects that's my
 
06:24:50.708 --> 06:24:50.718 align:start position:0%
understanding of this law it doesn't
 
06:24:53.270 --> 06:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't address that um I think the
 
06:24:55.070 --> 06:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
issue is actually more comparable let's
 
06:24:56.390 --> 06:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
say you know if we're going to stick
 
06:24:58.990 --> 06:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
with a car example um let's say you're a
 
06:25:02.190 --> 06:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
car manufacturer and you decide that for
 
06:25:04.390 --> 06:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
whatever reason uh instead of having
 
06:25:06.590 --> 06:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
your pickup truck maybe be able to do a
 
06:25:09.510 --> 06:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
maximum of 85 mil an hour uh you'll
 
06:25:12.310 --> 06:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
design it so it can do 200 mil an hour
 
06:25:14.230 --> 06:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
and not only will you design it to go
 
06:25:16.468 --> 06:25:16.478 align:start position:0%
200 miles an hour but you'll put an
 
06:25:19.590 --> 06:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
option on it that allows you to drive up
 
06:25:21.548 --> 06:25:21.558 align:start position:0%
really close to another person James
 
06:25:24.430 --> 06:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
Bond style and cut up their tires I mean
 
06:25:25.948 --> 06:25:25.958 align:start position:0%
these are decisions that that you make
 
06:25:29.390 --> 06:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
as a manufacturer how people use the
 
06:25:32.628 --> 06:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
product is up to them um however what
 
06:25:34.468 --> 06:25:34.478 align:start position:0%
you've done is you've created a
 
06:25:37.430 --> 06:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
situation where you make it possible for
 
06:25:40.350 --> 06:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
people to do a great deal of harm and I
 
06:25:42.070 --> 06:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
think this is this is one of the things
 
06:25:49.750 --> 06:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:53.628 --> 06:25:53.638 align:start position:0%
here thank you um so right now there is
 
06:25:55.390 --> 06:25:55.400 align:start position:0%
liability for a faulty product but
 
06:25:57.670 --> 06:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
you're trying to add in is liability for
 
06:26:00.910 --> 06:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
if a person decides to use a firearm in
 
06:26:03.350 --> 06:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
an inappropriate way and I guess I'm
 
06:26:04.590 --> 06:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
just not understanding because I mean
 
06:26:06.788 --> 06:26:06.798 align:start position:0%
there's many cars I don't know of really
 
06:26:09.190 --> 06:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
any any roads that the speed limit is
 
06:26:12.468 --> 06:26:12.478 align:start position:0%
above 75 but I know that my car can go
 
06:26:14.628 --> 06:26:14.638 align:start position:0%
120 so does that mean that if I choose
 
06:26:16.948 --> 06:26:16.958 align:start position:0%
to go 120 and kill somebody that my car
 
06:26:18.310 --> 06:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
would be liable for that the car
 
06:26:19.708 --> 06:26:19.718 align:start position:0%
manufacturer would be liable for that
 
06:26:22.468 --> 06:26:22.478 align:start position:0%
and not me I think one of the things you
 
06:26:24.070 --> 06:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
you realize is when you you have to
 
06:26:25.628 --> 06:26:25.638 align:start position:0%
realize is when you design design a
 
06:26:27.990 --> 06:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
product uh you know like this that can
 
06:26:32.150 --> 06:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
be used in an inherently D dangerous way
 
06:26:34.468 --> 06:26:34.478 align:start position:0%
uh there is a certain level of
 
06:26:37.110 --> 06:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility that you bear uh when it
 
06:26:39.708 --> 06:26:39.718 align:start position:0%
comes to the distribution of a product
 
06:26:42.590 --> 06:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
like that uh there's a certain degree of
 
06:26:44.750 --> 06:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility you bear for how the
 
06:26:46.030 --> 06:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
product is
 
06:26:48.910 --> 06:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
marketed um
 
06:26:52.230 --> 06:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh I I I think the thing the thing and
 
06:26:54.390 --> 06:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons why I I really
 
06:26:55.910 --> 06:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
think it's important to look at the
 
06:26:59.110 --> 06:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
statute is I don't really see anything
 
06:27:01.150 --> 06:27:01.160 align:start position:0%
like this in New Hampshire law for any
 
06:27:03.628 --> 06:27:03.638 align:start position:0%
other type of industry and there are
 
06:27:06.310 --> 06:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
lots of ways people can hurt themselves
 
06:27:08.230 --> 06:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
um Firearms just one of the many ways
 
06:27:11.150 --> 06:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
people can hurt themselves um what I
 
06:27:14.190 --> 06:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
don't see is is protection for any other
 
06:27:16.030 --> 06:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
industry in New Hampshire when it comes
 
06:27:19.430 --> 06:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
to this uh and I for the life of me can
 
06:27:21.590 --> 06:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
understand why we have
 
06:27:23.708 --> 06:27:23.718 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
06:27:26.548 --> 06:27:26.558 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you thanks for taking my
 
06:27:28.590 --> 06:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
statement my
 
06:27:31.390 --> 06:27:31.400 align:start position:0%
question I do not see this as comparing
 
06:27:34.628 --> 06:27:34.638 align:start position:0%
Apples to Apples I see this as comparing
 
06:27:37.750 --> 06:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
apples to oranges because all of the
 
06:27:41.230 --> 06:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
industries you are mentioned are not
 
06:27:43.510 --> 06:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
protected under
 
06:27:46.750 --> 06:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
my first second third amendment the
 
06:27:51.110 --> 06:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
right to carry arms is a protected under
 
06:27:54.030 --> 06:27:54.040 align:start position:0%
the Second Amendment and therefore to
 
06:27:57.030 --> 06:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
compare in my opinion to
 
06:28:01.390 --> 06:28:01.400 align:start position:0%
compare gun manufacturers to cars or
 
06:28:03.868 --> 06:28:03.878 align:start position:0%
whatever you're not comparing Apples to
 
06:28:07.708 --> 06:28:07.718 align:start position:0%
Apples I believe and I think it was just
 
06:28:10.468 --> 06:28:10.478 align:start position:0%
upheld by the decision that was just
 
06:28:13.390 --> 06:28:13.400 align:start position:0%
made that there's a big difference
 
06:28:17.230 --> 06:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
between a car manufacturer being liable
 
06:28:20.948 --> 06:28:20.958 align:start position:0%
and a gun manufacturer being liable for
 
06:28:24.670 --> 06:28:24.680 align:start position:0%
something someone does with a gun so I I
 
06:28:29.270 --> 06:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
just don't see how you believe that um
 
06:28:31.510 --> 06:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
you're comparing Apples to Apples here
 
06:28:33.310 --> 06:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
what what I'm saying basically what I'm
 
06:28:37.150 --> 06:28:37.160 align:start position:0%
saying and and I I I think there are um
 
06:28:39.030 --> 06:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
there are probably if we brainstorm long
 
06:28:41.230 --> 06:28:41.240 align:start position:0%
enough um lots of different scenarios
 
06:28:43.070 --> 06:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
that we could potentially come up come
 
06:28:46.548 --> 06:28:46.558 align:start position:0%
up with what what what I don't
 
06:28:48.390 --> 06:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
understand is that why this particular
 
06:28:50.868 --> 06:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
industry deser deserves a level of
 
06:28:52.350 --> 06:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
protection that we offer to no other
 
06:28:54.670 --> 06:28:54.680 align:start position:0%
industry manufacturing is not a second
 
06:28:57.948 --> 06:28:57.958 align:start position:0%
amount M right it's not I mean owning a
 
06:29:00.468 --> 06:29:00.478 align:start position:0%
firearm purchasing a firearm those are
 
06:29:03.190 --> 06:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
second amendment rights but there's no
 
06:29:05.548 --> 06:29:05.558 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment right to manufacturing
 
06:29:08.350 --> 06:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
a product at all this is not a second
 
06:29:12.070 --> 06:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
amendment issue this is a liability
 
06:29:14.670 --> 06:29:14.680 align:start position:0%
issue yes go
 
06:29:17.548 --> 06:29:17.558 align:start position:0%
ahead but I think we established that
 
06:29:17.558 --> 06:29:18.868 align:start position:0%
ahead but I think we established that
faulty

06:29:18.868 --> 06:29:18.878 align:start position:0%
faulty
 
06:29:22.830 --> 06:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturing is already covered if they
 
06:29:25.510 --> 06:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
knowingly fault faulty man manufacture
 
06:29:27.190 --> 06:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
something and sell it it's already
 
06:29:29.990 --> 06:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
covered so why do we need to make it
 
06:29:34.788 --> 06:29:34.798 align:start position:0%
specific to to guns I do personally see
 
06:29:38.350 --> 06:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
this as a
 
06:29:44.350 --> 06:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
um an attempt to possibly um stifling My
 
06:29:46.110 --> 06:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment right that's me
 
06:29:47.948 --> 06:29:47.958 align:start position:0%
personally I'm a strong Second Amendment
 
06:29:52.750 --> 06:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
advocate so um I just I I see it as a
 
06:29:55.230 --> 06:29:55.240 align:start position:0%
difference representative Walsh thank
 
06:29:57.548 --> 06:29:57.558 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question
 
06:30:00.150 --> 06:30:00.160 align:start position:0%
representative would you um in your
 
06:30:03.230 --> 06:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
testimony you stated that uh RSA 508 col
 
06:30:05.788 --> 06:30:05.798 align:start position:0%
21 out uh prohibits criminal and
 
06:30:07.430 --> 06:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
unlawful acts with Firearms
 
06:30:10.548 --> 06:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
manufacturers dealers Etc wouldn't it
 
06:30:12.548 --> 06:30:12.558 align:start position:0%
make sense then to amend the statute to
 
06:30:14.670 --> 06:30:14.680 align:start position:0%
include Motor Vehicles lawn tractors
 
06:30:16.628 --> 06:30:16.638 align:start position:0%
other types of industrial equipment that
 
06:30:19.070 --> 06:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
when used unlawfully causes injury of
 
06:30:21.190 --> 06:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
death that they wouldn't uh that they
 
06:30:22.590 --> 06:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
would also be
 
06:30:24.990 --> 06:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
protected I would say knock yourself out
 
06:30:26.310 --> 06:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
if you want to try to do that it would
 
06:30:27.830 --> 06:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
be a heck of a lot easier simply to
 
06:30:30.670 --> 06:30:30.680 align:start position:0%
repeal the statute the point is then we
 
06:30:32.430 --> 06:30:32.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have just the Firearms industry
 
06:30:34.590 --> 06:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
protected from unlawful acts committed
 
06:30:37.788 --> 06:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
by Bad actors then we would have and
 
06:30:39.990 --> 06:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
then essentially Firearms manufacturers
 
06:30:42.110 --> 06:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
would have to play by the same set of
 
06:30:43.868 --> 06:30:43.878 align:start position:0%
rules that everybody else has to play
 
06:30:46.548 --> 06:30:46.558 align:start position:0%
with regarding liability in this state
 
06:30:48.110 --> 06:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
that's what we're
 
06:30:51.708 --> 06:30:51.718 align:start position:0%
after other questions for this witness
 
06:30:53.628 --> 06:30:53.638 align:start position:0%
yes representative Stapleton thank you
 
06:30:56.230 --> 06:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
06:30:58.868 --> 06:30:58.878 align:start position:0%
question does
 
06:31:01.388 --> 06:31:01.398 align:start position:0%
Connecticut have
 
06:31:04.388 --> 06:31:04.398 align:start position:0%
um have reduced or eliminated this
 
06:31:06.948 --> 06:31:06.958 align:start position:0%
liability for gun manufacturers and why
 
06:31:10.150 --> 06:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
I'm asking that is it's heard that Ruger
 
06:31:13.070 --> 06:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturing left Connecticut because
 
06:31:17.628 --> 06:31:17.638 align:start position:0%
of the risk uh relative to U laws
 
06:31:20.670 --> 06:31:20.680 align:start position:0%
adverse to them Manufacturing in that
 
06:31:23.190 --> 06:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
state do you have any background or is
 
06:31:25.310 --> 06:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
this patterned off of something that
 
06:31:27.150 --> 06:31:27.160 align:start position:0%
Connecticut I don't know about the
 
06:31:27.160 --> 06:31:29.388 align:start position:0%
Connecticut I don't know about the
Connecticut

06:31:29.388 --> 06:31:29.398 align:start position:0%
Connecticut
 
06:31:31.430 --> 06:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
situation other questions for this
 
06:31:35.070 --> 06:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
witness so can I ask you a question if
 
06:31:38.590 --> 06:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
the if we were to repeal this
 
06:31:41.590 --> 06:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
bill am I would I be correct an
 
06:31:45.030 --> 06:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
understanding that a plaintiff somebody
 
06:31:46.310 --> 06:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
who was
 
06:31:51.708 --> 06:31:51.718 align:start position:0%
hurt because somebody was uh uh shot the
 
06:31:53.708 --> 06:31:53.718 align:start position:0%
person a person who was shot by a
 
06:31:56.788 --> 06:31:56.798 align:start position:0%
criminal with an
 
06:32:00.150 --> 06:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
AR-15 could bring a lawsuit against the
 
06:32:02.350 --> 06:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturer of the
 
06:32:07.070 --> 06:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
AR-15 saying that the AR-15 was uh
 
06:32:09.708 --> 06:32:09.718 align:start position:0%
unreasonably dangerous and defective
 
06:32:11.910 --> 06:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
because it shouldn't have been made at
 
06:32:14.868 --> 06:32:14.878 align:start position:0%
all that that would be that would be a a
 
06:32:17.750 --> 06:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
permissible lawsuit would it not well I
 
06:32:20.750 --> 06:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
think I think in our system um anybody
 
06:32:23.150 --> 06:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
can bring a lawsuit uh not everybody can
 
06:32:25.510 --> 06:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
win a lawsuit but it would be up to the
 
06:32:27.670 --> 06:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
jury wouldn't it wouldn't it so in other
 
06:32:30.948 --> 06:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
words instead of us all of us saying
 
06:32:32.590 --> 06:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to Outlaw
 
06:32:35.590 --> 06:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
AR15s we would allow 12 members of a
 
06:32:39.388 --> 06:32:39.398 align:start position:0%
jury pick that random to decide whether
 
06:32:41.868 --> 06:32:41.878 align:start position:0%
or not an AR-15 should be outlawed was
 
06:32:44.830 --> 06:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
unreasonably dangerous and and and
 
06:32:48.110 --> 06:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
therefore defective be and if that were
 
06:32:51.270 --> 06:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
if the jury came to that conclusion the
 
06:32:53.468 --> 06:32:53.478 align:start position:0%
you one can imagine the a what would
 
06:32:56.910 --> 06:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
happen to the AR-15 industry well my my
 
06:32:58.708 --> 06:32:58.718 align:start position:0%
understanding of the way that juries
 
06:33:00.948 --> 06:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
work is juries don't actually change the
 
06:33:04.628 --> 06:33:04.638 align:start position:0%
law um judges don't necessarily change
 
06:33:08.270 --> 06:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
the law legislators change the law um so
 
06:33:10.430 --> 06:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that a jury would actually
 
06:33:12.830 --> 06:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
have the power to do that what a jury
 
06:33:15.310 --> 06:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
would actually um have the power to do
 
06:33:17.110 --> 06:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
would be to to take a look at our laws
 
06:33:19.310 --> 06:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
see if the defendant has a case and then
 
06:33:20.830 --> 06:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
the weigh the merits of the case based
 
06:33:23.070 --> 06:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
on the way that our law is structured
 
06:33:24.510 --> 06:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
currently the way our law is structured
 
06:33:27.110 --> 06:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
Ed it is gained in the advantage of
 
06:33:29.270 --> 06:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
firearms manufacturers Sellers and
 
06:33:31.830 --> 06:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
importers and that's just a simple fact
 
06:33:33.670 --> 06:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
it's why those two police officers lost
 
06:33:36.070 --> 06:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
their suit now I haven't had a chance to
 
06:33:39.030 --> 06:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
review the specifics of that case but
 
06:33:41.948 --> 06:33:41.958 align:start position:0%
what proved to be the show stopper as I
 
06:33:43.548 --> 06:33:43.558 align:start position:0%
understand it with our Supreme Court was
 
06:33:45.510 --> 06:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that we had this Statute in
 
06:33:49.750 --> 06:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
place that provides liability lock solid
 
06:33:52.670 --> 06:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
liability for PE for for for dealers and
 
06:33:54.110 --> 06:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
for manufacturers who are in this
 
06:33:54.120 --> 06:33:55.948 align:start position:0%
for manufacturers who are in this
situation

06:33:55.948 --> 06:33:55.958 align:start position:0%
situation
 
06:33:59.030 --> 06:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
without this law in place the court
 
06:34:00.628 --> 06:34:00.638 align:start position:0%
would have had to have looked at other
 
06:34:03.310 --> 06:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
factors they would have had to examine
 
06:34:06.230 --> 06:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
um issues at a deeper level uh there
 
06:34:07.628 --> 06:34:07.638 align:start position:0%
would have been different evidence
 
06:34:09.750 --> 06:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
provided whether or not it would have
 
06:34:12.070 --> 06:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
been enough evidence for those officers
 
06:34:15.708 --> 06:34:15.718 align:start position:0%
to win their case I have no idea but
 
06:34:17.750 --> 06:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
what I do know is that the fact that we
 
06:34:21.788 --> 06:34:21.798 align:start position:0%
have this law basically stopped their
 
06:34:24.190 --> 06:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
entire case from proceeding and and I
 
06:34:26.030 --> 06:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
think that's a
 
06:34:29.190 --> 06:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
problem question representative sa yeah
 
06:34:30.990 --> 06:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
thank you once
 
06:34:34.590 --> 06:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
again I I heard on the radio or the TV
 
06:34:36.590 --> 06:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
last night in the news
 
06:34:40.868 --> 06:34:40.878 align:start position:0%
that the the suit was dismissed because
 
06:34:42.628 --> 06:34:42.638 align:start position:0%
there was no
 
06:34:46.750 --> 06:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
indication to the gun dealer um or or
 
06:34:51.990 --> 06:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
even the police that uh there was um a
 
06:34:55.548 --> 06:34:55.558 align:start position:0%
criminal history that would invoke
 
06:34:58.990 --> 06:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
um the prohibition to sell the
 
06:35:02.670 --> 06:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
gun so that's not the province of the
 
06:35:05.150 --> 06:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
gun manufacturer that's the province of
 
06:35:08.510 --> 06:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
the Intel and systems that keep track of
 
06:35:11.990 --> 06:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
this or fail to do so I I would submit
 
06:35:14.070 --> 06:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
that their suit was
 
06:35:16.150 --> 06:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
misdirected well and you know and I
 
06:35:17.830 --> 06:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
think you you know you might be right
 
06:35:20.670 --> 06:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
about that I mean the Supreme Court
 
06:35:23.750 --> 06:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
might have basically found that um it
 
06:35:26.070 --> 06:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
you know IR regardless of of this
 
06:35:27.788 --> 06:35:27.798 align:start position:0%
particular statute they may have found
 
06:35:30.270 --> 06:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
that the evidence uh didn't didn't
 
06:35:32.590 --> 06:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
justify uh the action and they they
 
06:35:35.628 --> 06:35:35.638 align:start position:0%
might have uh found against the officers
 
06:35:38.468 --> 06:35:38.478 align:start position:0%
but the the thing is is we'll never know
 
06:35:40.990 --> 06:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
um and and to be to be clear full
 
06:35:43.590 --> 06:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
disclosure I have not actually read the
 
06:35:45.990 --> 06:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
Court's decision what I'm going by is
 
06:35:50.350 --> 06:35:50.360 align:start position:0%
what WM reported but what Wu reported is
 
06:35:52.990 --> 06:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
the reason why the court decided not to
 
06:35:55.310 --> 06:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
move forward with this was because of
 
06:35:55.320 --> 06:35:57.190 align:start position:0%
move forward with this was because of
this

06:35:57.190 --> 06:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:35:59.750 --> 06:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
law representative
 
06:36:04.670 --> 06:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
trip uh thank you for taking my question
 
06:36:07.430 --> 06:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh your bill
 
06:36:11.548 --> 06:36:11.558 align:start position:0%
reads relative to limited liability for
 
06:36:14.628 --> 06:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
manufacturers Distributors dealers or
 
06:36:18.430 --> 06:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
importers of firearms or ammunition is
 
06:36:22.868 --> 06:36:22.878 align:start position:0%
repealed uh could you please describe to
 
06:36:27.910 --> 06:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
me what limited liability uh consist of
 
06:36:30.230 --> 06:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
what I'm sorry what what limited
 
06:36:33.868 --> 06:36:33.878 align:start position:0%
liability consists of
 
06:36:36.430 --> 06:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
H I would actually think there are other
 
06:36:37.868 --> 06:36:37.878 align:start position:0%
people in the room who are probably more
 
06:36:40.590 --> 06:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
qualified than me to describe you what
 
06:36:43.468 --> 06:36:43.478 align:start position:0%
limited liability is I'm not an attorney
 
06:36:47.110 --> 06:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
um uh but my understanding my Layman's
 
06:36:48.590 --> 06:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
understanding of what limited
 
06:36:51.670 --> 06:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
liability uh limited liability is is
 
06:36:54.468 --> 06:36:54.478 align:start position:0%
that it it's basically what it says it
 
06:36:57.468 --> 06:36:57.478 align:start position:0%
limits liability for for people who are
 
06:36:59.388 --> 06:36:59.398 align:start position:0%
in a who find themselves in a certain
 
06:37:02.628 --> 06:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
situation so this particular RSA not
 
06:37:05.510 --> 06:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
only applies to guns gun manufacturers
 
06:37:07.910 --> 06:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
but it also provide it also covers
 
06:37:10.270 --> 06:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
people like volunteer firefighters who
 
06:37:12.150 --> 06:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
may have to make on the spot decisions
 
06:37:13.350 --> 06:37:13.360 align:start position:0%
about which building they're going to
 
06:37:17.548 --> 06:37:17.558 align:start position:0%
save or not right um and by limited
 
06:37:20.388 --> 06:37:20.398 align:start position:0%
limited liability uh I think in some
 
06:37:22.110 --> 06:37:22.120 align:start position:0%
cases in the in the case of this
 
06:37:24.350 --> 06:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
particular statute it seems to preclude
 
06:37:26.628 --> 06:37:26.638 align:start position:0%
any liability just about any liability
 
06:37:29.468 --> 06:37:29.478 align:start position:0%
at all uh which is really limiting
 
06:37:31.830 --> 06:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
liability um but I think in other cases
 
06:37:33.548 --> 06:37:33.558 align:start position:0%
it can limit and and this is where I'm
 
06:37:36.310 --> 06:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
kind of getting out over my skis a
 
06:37:36.320 --> 06:37:37.110 align:start position:0%
kind of getting out over my skis a
little

06:37:37.110 --> 06:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
little
 
06:37:39.830 --> 06:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
bit but I think in other cases it can
 
06:37:41.670 --> 06:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
limit the amount of monetary damages
 
06:37:42.910 --> 06:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
that you can
 
06:37:45.990 --> 06:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
collect that's a great answer but not to
 
06:37:48.948 --> 06:37:48.958 align:start position:0%
the question I ask thank you I think you
 
06:37:51.830 --> 06:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
know if I can elaborate I I think I I'm
 
06:37:54.190 --> 06:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
not positive in this but I think what it
 
06:37:56.110 --> 06:37:56.120 align:start position:0%
when it says limited liability here what
 
06:37:58.190 --> 06:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
it means is what you were talking about
 
06:38:01.030 --> 06:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
before the liability is limited in
 
06:38:04.350 --> 06:38:04.360 align:start position:0%
certain cases that is when yes when the
 
06:38:06.910 --> 06:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
uh when the liability is predicated on
 
06:38:10.388 --> 06:38:10.398 align:start position:0%
the criminal conduct of it results from
 
06:38:12.708 --> 06:38:12.718 align:start position:0%
the criminal conduct of somebody else
 
06:38:16.230 --> 06:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
but it would not there's there's no um
 
06:38:19.110 --> 06:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
immunity from liability if for example
 
06:38:21.270 --> 06:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
the you know the the trigger is faulty
 
06:38:22.750 --> 06:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
and the gun goes off when it's not
 
06:38:25.830 --> 06:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to or or uh or something like
 
06:38:28.468 --> 06:38:28.478 align:start position:0%
that is that that's what I think it
 
06:38:30.670 --> 06:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
meant that's that's it's limited in that
 
06:38:33.110 --> 06:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
sense it doesn't cover the Firearms
 
06:38:35.070 --> 06:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturers aren't completely immune
 
06:38:36.990 --> 06:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
from liability if they have a defective
 
06:38:39.430 --> 06:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
firearm for example but they are in this
 
06:38:40.670 --> 06:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
06:38:43.830 --> 06:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
circumstance yes representative K I
 
06:38:45.708 --> 06:38:45.718 align:start position:0%
guess I'm just not understanding why
 
06:38:49.150 --> 06:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
should a manufacturer or a dealer be
 
06:38:53.030 --> 06:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
liable if the sale was
 
06:38:55.868 --> 06:38:55.878 align:start position:0%
legal for somebody else's actions why
 
06:38:57.830 --> 06:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
are they liable for what somebody else
 
06:39:01.230 --> 06:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
chooses to do provided that everything
 
06:39:03.150 --> 06:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
else was legal as part of the process
 
06:39:05.468 --> 06:39:05.478 align:start position:0%
and that they've not participated in
 
06:39:07.230 --> 06:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
some sort of other you know illegal
 
06:39:09.070 --> 06:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
thing like giving a firearm to somebody
 
06:39:10.468 --> 06:39:10.478 align:start position:0%
that they shouldn't
 
06:39:13.468 --> 06:39:13.478 align:start position:0%
have yeah I I I think I've actually
 
06:39:17.070 --> 06:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:20.350 --> 06:39:20.360 align:start position:0%
times can I just ask one other question
 
06:39:20.360 --> 06:39:22.190 align:start position:0%
times can I just ask one other question
is

06:39:22.190 --> 06:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:39:25.788 --> 06:39:25.798 align:start position:0%
the my understanding ing from around the
 
06:39:28.990 --> 06:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
country uh is that there before there
 
06:39:31.150 --> 06:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
was a federal statute there's a federal
 
06:39:33.708 --> 06:39:33.718 align:start position:0%
statute that deals with this same area
 
06:39:37.430 --> 06:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
but that before that and one of the
 
06:39:39.510 --> 06:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
things that prompted the federal statute
 
06:39:43.230 --> 06:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
is that there were claims against gun
 
06:39:46.510 --> 06:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturers along these lines for
 
06:39:51.110 --> 06:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
example um you make you gun manufacturer
 
06:39:54.430 --> 06:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
you Smith and Wesson you manufacture Ed
 
06:39:54.440 --> 06:39:55.430 align:start position:0%
you Smith and Wesson you manufacture Ed
too

06:39:55.430 --> 06:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
too
 
06:39:59.510 --> 06:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
many uh 9mm handguns there wasn't you
 
06:40:01.948 --> 06:40:01.958 align:start position:0%
there there wasn't enough of a market
 
06:40:05.110 --> 06:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
for 9 millimeter handguns to to justify
 
06:40:06.990 --> 06:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
your making and I'm just making this
 
06:40:08.468 --> 06:40:08.478 align:start position:0%
number up but there wasn't enough of a
 
06:40:11.750 --> 06:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
market to to justify you're making
 
06:40:14.150 --> 06:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
200,000 of those last year you only
 
06:40:16.070 --> 06:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
should have made
 
06:40:18.990 --> 06:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
150,000 um and it's your responsibility
 
06:40:21.788 --> 06:40:21.798 align:start position:0%
Smith and Wesson to find out what the
 
06:40:25.190 --> 06:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
market should be um for these and if you
 
06:40:26.910 --> 06:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
didn't we're going to hold you liable
 
06:40:29.030 --> 06:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
for that it was that kind of thing I
 
06:40:31.150 --> 06:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
think that the at least at the federal
 
06:40:33.628 --> 06:40:33.638 align:start position:0%
level that Congress was concerned about
 
06:40:35.310 --> 06:40:35.320 align:start position:0%
basically saying wait a minute we don't
 
06:40:37.830 --> 06:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
you know we don't tell General Motors
 
06:40:40.830 --> 06:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
you know you made too many cars um we
 
06:40:43.350 --> 06:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
don't we don't say you're you're liable
 
06:40:48.670 --> 06:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
for for uh this Chevy Impala having gone
 
06:40:50.670 --> 06:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
off the road and and somebody being
 
06:40:53.070 --> 06:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
injured because you you made too many
 
06:40:56.350 --> 06:40:56.360 align:start position:0%
Chevy ow we don't do that kind of
 
06:40:59.310 --> 06:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
thing I mean I think I think that's
 
06:41:01.070 --> 06:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
correct is it
 
06:41:03.990 --> 06:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
not you know I would I would uh you know
 
06:41:06.310 --> 06:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
defer to your understanding of you know
 
06:41:08.590 --> 06:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
of federal law and the issues U that are
 
06:41:10.230 --> 06:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
in question I guess I guess what I just
 
06:41:13.750 --> 06:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
come back to is where is the public
 
06:41:16.910 --> 06:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
benefit um where is the public benefit
 
06:41:19.150 --> 06:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
of this statute you know as I go through
 
06:41:23.590 --> 06:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
RSA 508 and I look at all of the other
 
06:41:25.230 --> 06:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
uh instances where the state has
 
06:41:27.070 --> 06:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
conferred limited liability I find
 
06:41:29.670 --> 06:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
myself not in an agreement from the
 
06:41:31.910 --> 06:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
state like if you're going to take the
 
06:41:35.030 --> 06:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
right of somebody to Super damages
 
06:41:37.150 --> 06:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
away I I think it's pretty well
 
06:41:39.230 --> 06:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
established in our law that there should
 
06:41:40.590 --> 06:41:40.600 align:start position:0%
be a public
 
06:41:44.350 --> 06:41:44.360 align:start position:0%
benefit and the only benefit that I see
 
06:41:46.310 --> 06:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
in this particular statute is the
 
06:41:49.510 --> 06:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
benefit that is incurred by
 
06:41:52.190 --> 06:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and dealers uh in an
 
06:41:55.670 --> 06:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
industry that that doesn't have to
 
06:42:00.270 --> 06:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
innovate um and that in many cases
 
06:42:02.948 --> 06:42:02.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't even have to act responsibly and
 
06:42:05.230 --> 06:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a problem
 
06:42:05.240 --> 06:42:07.830 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a problem
representative

06:42:07.830 --> 06:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:12.468 --> 06:42:12.478 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr Mr chair um I
 
06:42:14.868 --> 06:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
actually am going to begin by telling
 
06:42:17.910 --> 06:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
the distinguished representative from
 
06:42:22.590 --> 06:42:22.600 align:start position:0%
Portsmith that I don't agree with him um
 
06:42:25.190 --> 06:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
about something that he he just said I
 
06:42:29.468 --> 06:42:29.478 align:start position:0%
for example am completely opposed to
 
06:42:33.310 --> 06:42:33.320 align:start position:0%
limited liability that protects Law
 
06:42:33.320 --> 06:42:35.150 align:start position:0%
limited liability that protects Law
Enforcement

06:42:35.150 --> 06:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
Enforcement
 
06:42:40.548 --> 06:42:40.558 align:start position:0%
Officers um from being held
 
06:42:42.670 --> 06:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
responsible for acting in an
 
06:42:47.150 --> 06:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
inappropriate way I think that limited
 
06:42:50.510 --> 06:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
liability in that area is not in the
 
06:42:53.230 --> 06:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
best interests of the public I think
 
06:42:57.590 --> 06:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
limit liability in that area has been
 
06:42:59.788 --> 06:42:59.798 align:start position:0%
part of uh
 
06:43:02.190 --> 06:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
increasing the sense of
 
06:43:04.388 --> 06:43:04.398 align:start position:0%
distrust that many people in this
 
06:43:08.548 --> 06:43:08.558 align:start position:0%
country have for um for police I happen
 
06:43:10.670 --> 06:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
to think that they very few rotten
 
06:43:13.868 --> 06:43:13.878 align:start position:0%
apples in that barrel and I just assume
 
06:43:16.388 --> 06:43:16.398 align:start position:0%
make sure that the few rotten
 
06:43:20.110 --> 06:43:20.120 align:start position:0%
barrels uh I the few frotten apples are
 
06:43:23.350 --> 06:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
focused on and not all the other apples
 
06:43:25.270 --> 06:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh so limited
 
06:43:25.280 --> 06:43:27.350 align:start position:0%
uh so limited
liability

06:43:27.350 --> 06:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
liability
 
06:43:30.670 --> 06:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
is is is very
 
06:43:33.628 --> 06:43:33.638 align:start position:0%
tricky I'm sitting here though and and
 
06:43:38.590 --> 06:43:38.600 align:start position:0%
this is a question maybe um I'll try to
 
06:43:41.350 --> 06:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
make it a question um and I won't say
 
06:43:44.948 --> 06:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
you know do you believe I won't say that
 
06:43:47.750 --> 06:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
but I'm listening to the questions that
 
06:43:51.030 --> 06:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
are asked and the answers that are
 
06:43:55.110 --> 06:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
given and I believe that we're all
 
06:43:55.120 --> 06:43:56.670 align:start position:0%
given and I believe that we're all
skirting

06:43:56.670 --> 06:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
skirting
 
06:43:56.680 --> 06:43:58.388 align:start position:0%
skirting
around

06:43:58.388 --> 06:43:58.398 align:start position:0%
around
 
06:44:01.230 --> 06:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
the I'll say the gorilla in the room I
 
06:44:03.708 --> 06:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
don't want to say elephant because that
 
06:44:05.910 --> 06:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
might you might think I mean something
 
06:44:10.388 --> 06:44:10.398 align:start position:0%
different and that is the availability
 
06:44:11.750 --> 06:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
in this
 
06:44:15.468 --> 06:44:15.478 align:start position:0%
country of guns that are
 
06:44:20.510 --> 06:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
designed uh to kill people and um we're
 
06:44:23.628 --> 06:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
not talking here about all those people
 
06:44:27.230 --> 06:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
we send off to war and give them weapons
 
06:44:30.548 --> 06:44:30.558 align:start position:0%
supposedly in to defend us we're talking
 
06:44:34.190 --> 06:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
about guns on the streets here um and I
 
06:44:36.350 --> 06:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
think that those people who are asking
 
06:44:38.548 --> 06:44:38.558 align:start position:0%
you questions about don't you believe
 
06:44:40.708 --> 06:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
this and that believe that there
 
06:44:43.350 --> 06:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be any limits on access to
 
06:44:46.788 --> 06:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
weapons and I believe your answers
 
06:44:49.708 --> 06:44:49.718 align:start position:0%
reflect your view and the view of
 
06:44:52.990 --> 06:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
others in this room who believe that yes
 
06:44:56.070 --> 06:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
access to guns should be limited and
 
06:44:58.708 --> 06:44:58.718 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to figure out is how
 
06:45:02.110 --> 06:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
to do that so the question that I asked
 
06:45:06.070 --> 06:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
I did get to it eventually was is this
 
06:45:07.708 --> 06:45:07.718 align:start position:0%
the best
 
06:45:09.708 --> 06:45:09.718 align:start position:0%
way to
 
06:45:12.270 --> 06:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
address the gorilla in the room that
 
06:45:15.388 --> 06:45:15.398 align:start position:0%
we're not willing to recognize and that
 
06:45:18.628 --> 06:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
is the availability of weapons many of
 
06:45:22.350 --> 06:45:22.360 align:start position:0%
which were designed for war and not for
 
06:45:24.670 --> 06:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
civilian use
 
06:45:28.388 --> 06:45:28.398 align:start position:0%
in on our city streets it is a way for
 
06:45:30.510 --> 06:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
an individual who feels that they have
 
06:45:34.430 --> 06:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
been harmed to get redress um and that's
 
06:45:36.270 --> 06:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
something that under the statute is not
 
06:45:39.948 --> 06:45:39.958 align:start position:0%
available to them now um uh it wasn't
 
06:45:42.868 --> 06:45:42.878 align:start position:0%
available to those two police officers
 
06:45:47.750 --> 06:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
um and I and I think you know I we have
 
06:45:49.510 --> 06:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of larger issues you
 
06:45:51.388 --> 06:45:51.398 align:start position:0%
know when it comes to guns when it comes
 
06:45:52.910 --> 06:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
to Second Amendment rights there are a
 
06:45:55.110 --> 06:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
lot of things things I I think that we
 
06:45:58.110 --> 06:45:58.120 align:start position:0%
need to have long and hard conversations
 
06:46:00.910 --> 06:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
about um but this
 
06:46:03.788 --> 06:46:03.798 align:start position:0%
one this one should be relatively easy
 
06:46:06.070 --> 06:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
because it's literally a level of
 
06:46:08.030 --> 06:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
protection that we provide to no other
 
06:46:10.868 --> 06:46:10.878 align:start position:0%
industry um without any sort of
 
06:46:13.190 --> 06:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
perceived public benefit now even even
 
06:46:16.990 --> 06:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
in the case of police officers I know um
 
06:46:18.670 --> 06:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
there's there are very good arguments on
 
06:46:21.110 --> 06:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
both sides of whether whether or not
 
06:46:22.868 --> 06:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
liability should be limited for police
 
06:46:25.468 --> 06:46:25.478 align:start position:0%
officers we hear those arguments over in
 
06:46:28.628 --> 06:46:28.638 align:start position:0%
my committee and criminal justice uh uh
 
06:46:33.910 --> 06:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of the time um but I
 
06:46:37.628 --> 06:46:37.638 align:start position:0%
think you know one of the things that we
 
06:46:39.670 --> 06:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
you know that we need
 
06:46:42.990 --> 06:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
to you know to to to basically just keep
 
06:46:45.468 --> 06:46:45.478 align:start position:0%
coming back to is
 
06:46:48.070 --> 06:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
um we're not here to solve all the
 
06:46:51.230 --> 06:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
problems of the world we're not here to
 
06:46:53.468 --> 06:46:53.478 align:start position:0%
figure out what the solution is to the
 
06:46:55.070 --> 06:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
problem of gun violence or police
 
06:46:57.590 --> 06:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
officer liability what we are here to do
 
06:46:59.230 --> 06:46:59.240 align:start position:0%
is to decide whether or not we're going
 
06:47:02.190 --> 06:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
to pass this bill and whether or not it
 
06:47:03.708 --> 06:47:03.718 align:start position:0%
would create a public benefit for the
 
06:47:08.468 --> 06:47:08.478 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire so um uh you
 
06:47:11.948 --> 06:47:11.958 align:start position:0%
know I think that's you know basically
 
06:47:15.270 --> 06:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
where I am on it other representative
 
06:47:19.468 --> 06:47:19.478 align:start position:0%
katat um so you mentioned about the
 
06:47:20.990 --> 06:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
other the other statues that are
 
06:47:22.230 --> 06:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
currently in place with limited
 
06:47:24.430 --> 06:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
liability and referenced their benefit
 
06:47:26.750 --> 06:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
to the public isn't there a public
 
06:47:29.548 --> 06:47:29.558 align:start position:0%
benefit in citizens being able to
 
06:47:31.310 --> 06:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
utilize their Second Amendment right
 
06:47:33.150 --> 06:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
when we've drawn to the fact that
 
06:47:35.030 --> 06:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturers have left places like
 
06:47:36.788 --> 06:47:36.798 align:start position:0%
California that don't have these limited
 
06:47:38.788 --> 06:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
liability statutes isn't there a concern
 
06:47:40.750 --> 06:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
that if we were to put this in place
 
06:47:41.750 --> 06:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
that the gun
 
06:47:43.708 --> 06:47:43.718 align:start position:0%
manufacturers wouldn't have anywhere to
 
06:47:45.070 --> 06:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
manufacture their guns and we wouldn't
 
06:47:46.750 --> 06:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
be able to to exercise our Second
 
06:47:49.670 --> 06:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment right second amendment rights
 
06:47:54.110 --> 06:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
are totally unrelated to liability
 
06:47:57.070 --> 06:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
um there is there is no there there's
 
06:47:59.430 --> 06:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
there might be sort of a tangental
 
06:48:01.468 --> 06:48:01.478 align:start position:0%
connection that we make up in our minds
 
06:48:02.948 --> 06:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
but I I don't think that there's a
 
06:48:04.750 --> 06:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
connection there from a legal
 
06:48:07.388 --> 06:48:07.398 align:start position:0%
perspective um this is not about second
 
06:48:09.788 --> 06:48:09.798 align:start position:0%
amendment rights it's about whether or
 
06:48:13.830 --> 06:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
not an entire industry um that has been
 
06:48:16.590 --> 06:48:16.600 align:start position:0%
conferred this special right this
 
06:48:19.590 --> 06:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
special privilege uh is actually
 
06:48:22.708 --> 06:48:22.718 align:start position:0%
creating uh a a public benefit and
 
06:48:24.388 --> 06:48:24.398 align:start position:0%
whether or not they should continue to
 
06:48:28.350 --> 06:48:28.360 align:start position:0%
have the the right or or the ability or
 
06:48:30.628 --> 06:48:30.638 align:start position:0%
or whether you know whether we should
 
06:48:33.788 --> 06:48:33.798 align:start position:0%
continue to grant them um this this
 
06:48:36.230 --> 06:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
special status uh that we've granted to
 
06:48:38.150 --> 06:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
them in no other industry and and I'm
 
06:48:41.750 --> 06:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
sure gez what about the ski industry you
 
06:48:43.948 --> 06:48:43.958 align:start position:0%
know I mean how how cool would it be if
 
06:48:44.990 --> 06:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
they didn't have to worry about
 
06:48:46.628 --> 06:48:46.638 align:start position:0%
liability and and what are some other
 
06:48:48.990 --> 06:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
Industries in New Hampshire you know I
 
06:48:50.830 --> 06:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
think I think they
 
06:48:53.510 --> 06:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
don't they don't they have don't they
 
06:48:56.830 --> 06:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
have a good bit of immunity yes they do
 
06:48:59.150 --> 06:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
I think they do they do yeah they do
 
06:49:01.670 --> 06:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
with your purchase of the ticket right
 
06:49:04.150 --> 06:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
right other question yes representative
 
06:49:06.388 --> 06:49:06.398 align:start position:0%
Perez and then representative Wallace
 
06:49:08.468 --> 06:49:08.478 align:start position:0%
thank you uh just to bring to
 
06:49:10.070 --> 06:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
everybody's attention uh I think we'd
 
06:49:12.590 --> 06:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
all agree that the lack of liability for
 
06:49:15.270 --> 06:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
the uh pharmaceutical companies with all
 
06:49:19.150 --> 06:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
the uh Jabs and uh injections they have
 
06:49:21.070 --> 06:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
no liability so they're they're clearly
 
06:49:22.590 --> 06:49:22.600 align:start position:0%
well protected and there's a lot of harm
 
06:49:25.150 --> 06:49:25.160 align:start position:0%
going on there would you agree my
 
06:49:26.430 --> 06:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
understanding is they're protected under
 
06:49:29.510 --> 06:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
federal law I I do not see them listed
 
06:49:32.230 --> 06:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
in RSA 508 as having that protection
 
06:49:34.070 --> 06:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire law and that's
 
06:49:36.548 --> 06:49:36.558 align:start position:0%
that's really what this is
 
06:49:38.788 --> 06:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
about representative
 
06:49:42.110 --> 06:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
Press thank you thanks for taking my
 
06:49:44.510 --> 06:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
question it's my understanding correct
 
06:49:46.510 --> 06:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong that the suit that was
 
06:49:49.350 --> 06:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
just settled was settled because the
 
06:49:51.708 --> 06:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
gentleman who purchased the gun his
 
06:49:54.670 --> 06:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
06:49:59.590 --> 06:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
history was not made public to the gun
 
06:50:03.388 --> 06:50:03.398 align:start position:0%
dealer so therefore he was able to buy a
 
06:50:06.190 --> 06:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
gun that's my understanding of what the
 
06:50:08.310 --> 06:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
several things that I have
 
06:50:12.270 --> 06:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
read why wasn't his mental health
 
06:50:16.670 --> 06:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
history come up is that because we are
 
06:50:20.468 --> 06:50:20.478 align:start position:0%
protecting overprotecting that because
 
06:50:23.670 --> 06:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that most of these
 
06:50:27.150 --> 06:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
mass shootings that we have had these
 
06:50:28.548 --> 06:50:28.558 align:start position:0%
people have
 
06:50:31.868 --> 06:50:31.878 align:start position:0%
had mental health issues that have been
 
06:50:34.948 --> 06:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
known but I'm trying when and when
 
06:50:38.430 --> 06:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
purchasing a gun they were protected so
 
06:50:42.468 --> 06:50:42.478 align:start position:0%
we're protecting their right to privacy
 
06:50:45.230 --> 06:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
with their mental health issues but yet
 
06:50:49.990 --> 06:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
we are allowing them to purchase guns
 
06:50:53.030 --> 06:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
and kill people so I think maybe we need
 
06:50:56.070 --> 06:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
to look back and
 
06:50:59.590 --> 06:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
see what's the best way to protect the
 
06:51:04.150 --> 06:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
public and putting the onus on the gun
 
06:51:07.548 --> 06:51:07.558 align:start position:0%
manufacturer or the gun salesperson as
 
06:51:09.788 --> 06:51:09.798 align:start position:0%
opposed to the onus on what we are
 
06:51:12.110 --> 06:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
allowed to to be
 
06:51:14.230 --> 06:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
known is
 
06:51:17.868 --> 06:51:17.878 align:start position:0%
we're we're missing the point had his
 
06:51:20.830 --> 06:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
mental health status been available to
 
06:51:24.990 --> 06:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
that gun person gun salesman he would
 
06:51:28.310 --> 06:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
probably have not been able to purchase
 
06:51:32.270 --> 06:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
the gun what does that have to do with
 
06:51:34.430 --> 06:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
this it has nothing to do with this it
 
06:51:38.548 --> 06:51:38.558 align:start position:0%
has to do with a man was protected by
 
06:51:41.788 --> 06:51:41.798 align:start position:0%
our laws was able to buy a gun and use
 
06:51:45.628 --> 06:51:45.638 align:start position:0%
it poorly so I know my high horse I'm
 
06:51:47.948 --> 06:51:47.958 align:start position:0%
sorry all right well the good news is we
 
06:51:49.628 --> 06:51:49.638 align:start position:0%
actually have a bill for that um and
 
06:51:51.030 --> 06:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
we're hearing it tomorrow in criminal
 
06:51:52.590 --> 06:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
justice it's a mental health reporting
 
06:51:54.310 --> 06:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
bill uh New Hampshire is currently one
 
06:51:56.548 --> 06:51:56.558 align:start position:0%
of three states that doesn't report
 
06:51:58.830 --> 06:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
adjudicated mental health uh information
 
06:52:01.430 --> 06:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
to the federal firearms background check
 
06:52:05.030 --> 06:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
system um and uh I'm a co-sponsor of a
 
06:52:07.788 --> 06:52:07.798 align:start position:0%
bill that uh representative Roy is the
 
06:52:11.270 --> 06:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of um and essentially that
 
06:52:12.948 --> 06:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
bill would allow the reporting of people
 
06:52:15.548 --> 06:52:15.558 align:start position:0%
who are involuntarily uh committed on a
 
06:52:15.558 --> 06:52:16.670 align:start position:0%
who are involuntarily uh committed on a
non-emergency

06:52:16.670 --> 06:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
non-emergency
 
06:52:20.708 --> 06:52:20.718 align:start position:0%
basis um adjudicated as uh Innocent by
 
06:52:24.350 --> 06:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
reason of of insanity uh or um
 
06:52:29.150 --> 06:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
incompetent to stand trial um and uh and
 
06:52:31.150 --> 06:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
there are privacy protections that are
 
06:52:33.910 --> 06:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
built into that there is a redress uh
 
06:52:35.548 --> 06:52:35.558 align:start position:0%
procedure for people who get better to
 
06:52:37.830 --> 06:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
get their arms back and I'm really
 
06:52:39.230 --> 06:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
hoping that when the time comes it would
 
06:52:41.750 --> 06:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
have the support of everyone on this
 
06:52:43.910 --> 06:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
committee other questions for this
 
06:52:47.110 --> 06:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
witness representative
 
06:52:49.590 --> 06:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
Andrew thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:52:52.430 --> 06:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I just found
 
06:52:54.310 --> 06:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
something it was very interesting which
 
06:52:56.590 --> 06:52:56.600 align:start position:0%
I think we all need to look into it's
 
06:52:58.350 --> 06:52:58.360 align:start position:0%
called and I don't know if you're
 
06:53:00.510 --> 06:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
familiar with it or not it's called the
 
06:53:04.350 --> 06:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
protection of lawful Commerce in arms
 
06:53:07.708 --> 06:53:07.718 align:start position:0%
act the protection of lawful Commerce in
 
06:53:10.190 --> 06:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
arms Act
 
06:53:15.788 --> 06:53:15.798 align:start position:0%
pcaa is a US law passed in 2005 that
 
06:53:18.388 --> 06:53:18.398 align:start position:0%
protects fire on manufacturers and
 
06:53:21.628 --> 06:53:21.638 align:start position:0%
dealers from being held liable when
 
06:53:23.388 --> 06:53:23.398 align:start position:0%
crimes have been committed committed
 
06:53:26.548 --> 06:53:26.558 align:start position:0%
with their products now are you familiar
 
06:53:29.190 --> 06:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
with this and if we are I think it's
 
06:53:31.350 --> 06:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
something we all need to look
 
06:53:34.070 --> 06:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
into well I think federal federal law
 
06:53:36.510 --> 06:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
and state law uh may sound similar but
 
06:53:38.548 --> 06:53:38.558 align:start position:0%
they are they are two different things
 
06:53:41.350 --> 06:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh what actually stopped the lawsuit of
 
06:53:43.190 --> 06:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
those police officers that I mentioned
 
06:53:45.388 --> 06:53:45.398 align:start position:0%
from going forward was not the federal
 
06:53:47.468 --> 06:53:47.478 align:start position:0%
law it was the state law and that's what
 
06:53:49.270 --> 06:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
we're trying to
 
06:53:52.910 --> 06:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
change other questions to this Witness
 
06:53:54.670 --> 06:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much representative
 
06:53:55.708 --> 06:53:55.718 align:start position:0%
appreciate thank
 
06:53:59.070 --> 06:53:59.080 align:start position:0%
you next I'm going to call on uh
 
06:54:05.510 --> 06:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:05.520 --> 06:54:08.750 align:start position:0%
 
wheeler

06:54:08.750 --> 06:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:11.030 --> 06:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
okay oh yes thank
 
06:54:14.430 --> 06:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman and and U
 
06:54:17.150 --> 06:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um I was very
 
06:54:19.388 --> 06:54:19.398 align:start position:0%
interested in this bill because I was uh
 
06:54:21.868 --> 06:54:21.878 align:start position:0%
involved with my son Attorney James
 
06:54:23.468 --> 06:54:23.478 align:start position:0%
wheeler when he was sitting on this
 
06:54:26.750 --> 06:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
Committee in 2003 of writing this
 
06:54:28.948 --> 06:54:28.958 align:start position:0%
legislation because of what was going on
 
06:54:31.150 --> 06:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
at the time and people were trying to
 
06:54:34.150 --> 06:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
sue gun manufacturers and dealers just
 
06:54:36.590 --> 06:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
like uh they would sue the tobacco
 
06:54:39.948 --> 06:54:39.958 align:start position:0%
companies um and so that's why we put in
 
06:54:43.110 --> 06:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
that legislation uh back in 2003 there's
 
06:54:45.628 --> 06:54:45.638 align:start position:0%
other people in this room uh that were
 
06:54:47.628 --> 06:54:47.638 align:start position:0%
involved in that back then too and it
 
06:54:50.190 --> 06:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
was also uh an initiative of the New
 
06:54:52.910 --> 06:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Firearms Coalition uh back at
 
06:54:52.920 --> 06:54:54.030 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Firearms Coalition uh back at
the

06:54:54.030 --> 06:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:54:56.430 --> 06:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
time I wanted to say that I think that
 
06:54:58.468 --> 06:54:58.478 align:start position:0%
the Chester RS decision was right and
 
06:55:02.750 --> 06:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
just uh yesterday um based on the facts
 
06:55:04.388 --> 06:55:04.398 align:start position:0%
and I think another speaker will talk
 
06:55:08.270 --> 06:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
about uh why that person maybe um um
 
06:55:10.430 --> 06:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
didn't wasn't on the prohibited person
 
06:55:13.590 --> 06:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
list um at the
 
06:55:17.150 --> 06:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
time I would I would also say that in in
 
06:55:19.750 --> 06:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
my view and this is strictly my view uh
 
06:55:22.150 --> 06:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
that this bill is brought forward so
 
06:55:24.110 --> 06:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
that people can sue manufacturers
 
06:55:26.788 --> 06:55:26.798 align:start position:0%
dealers and Distributors and the purpose
 
06:55:28.468 --> 06:55:28.478 align:start position:0%
of that wouldn't be to protect the
 
06:55:30.910 --> 06:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
public the purpose of that would be to
 
06:55:33.510 --> 06:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
cost those manufacturers and dealers uh
 
06:55:35.948 --> 06:55:35.958 align:start position:0%
their financial viability and put them
 
06:55:38.590 --> 06:55:38.600 align:start position:0%
out of business and just chip away at
 
06:55:40.910 --> 06:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
the number of Manufacturers um that
 
06:55:42.910 --> 06:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
would be making Firearms making them
 
06:55:47.548 --> 06:55:47.558 align:start position:0%
more expensive uh for the public to
 
06:55:51.110 --> 06:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
buy um so and I wanted to also expound
 
06:55:54.350 --> 06:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
on representative lind's example of the
 
06:55:57.548 --> 06:55:57.558 align:start position:0%
automobile think of it this way if there
 
06:56:01.110 --> 06:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
is a person who is drunk and kills
 
06:56:04.110 --> 06:56:04.120 align:start position:0%
somebody with that automobile who's
 
06:56:07.750 --> 06:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
responsible the drunk or the automobile
 
06:56:10.350 --> 06:56:10.360 align:start position:0%
and this is a this is the same uh
 
06:56:12.430 --> 06:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
protection that gun dealers and
 
06:56:14.910 --> 06:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturers need it is not the
 
06:56:17.430 --> 06:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
automobile that was responsible it was
 
06:56:21.070 --> 06:56:21.080 align:start position:0%
the person who criminally misused that
 
06:56:23.750 --> 06:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
firearm um and if I have just a little
 
06:56:26.270 --> 06:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
bit of latitude I'd like to comment on
 
06:56:29.468 --> 06:56:29.478 align:start position:0%
the mental health bill that's coming up
 
06:56:31.430 --> 06:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
on Friday in the criminal justice
 
06:56:33.510 --> 06:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
committee because I just want to put
 
06:56:37.070 --> 06:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
this out there well over 90% of people
 
06:56:40.350 --> 06:56:40.360 align:start position:0%
who are involuntarily committed are not
 
06:56:43.628 --> 06:56:43.638 align:start position:0%
violent people and very often those
 
06:56:47.190 --> 06:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
situations are very temporary you put
 
06:56:50.070 --> 06:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
someone on the federal prohibited person
 
06:56:53.510 --> 06:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
list try to get them off Cong regularly
 
06:56:56.510 --> 06:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
defunds the mechanism to get people off
 
06:56:59.788 --> 06:56:59.798 align:start position:0%
that list so again another bill from the
 
06:57:02.190 --> 06:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
same representative trying to chip away
 
06:57:04.750 --> 06:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
at our Second Amendment rights Peace by
 
06:57:08.270 --> 06:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
piece by piece thank you questions for
 
06:57:10.548 --> 06:57:10.558 align:start position:0%
representative wheer councelor wheeler

06:57:15.468 --> 06:57:15.478 align:start position:0%
way seeing none thank you very much next
 
06:57:17.590 --> 06:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call on representative uh
 
06:57:21.388 --> 06:57:21.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:21.398 --> 06:57:29.230 align:start position:0%
 
please

06:57:29.230 --> 06:57:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:31.350 --> 06:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
06:57:32.910 --> 06:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm representative
 
06:57:34.948 --> 06:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
Jonathan Stone I represent Sullivan 8
 
06:57:36.788 --> 06:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
which includes the city of clamont which
 
06:57:38.670 --> 06:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
is adjacent to Newport which houses
 
06:57:41.548 --> 06:57:41.558 align:start position:0%
Ruger firearms uh I'd like to start off
 
06:57:43.788 --> 06:57:43.798 align:start position:0%
by saying in full disclosure prior to
 
06:57:45.788 --> 06:57:45.798 align:start position:0%
entering politics I was involved in the
 
06:57:48.110 --> 06:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturing side of uh firearms in the
 
06:57:50.110 --> 06:57:50.120 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and have quite a
 
06:57:51.310 --> 06:57:51.320 align:start position:0%
working knowledge of both the federal
 
06:57:53.230 --> 06:57:53.240 align:start position:0%
and state laws that are apply to it as
 
06:57:56.270 --> 06:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
well uh the problem I see with this bill
 
06:57:58.110 --> 06:57:58.120 align:start position:0%
and I had constituents reach out to me
 
06:58:00.388 --> 06:58:00.398 align:start position:0%
with their similar concerns is that I've
 
06:58:01.830 --> 06:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
heard testimony today that really
 
06:58:03.628 --> 06:58:03.638 align:start position:0%
crosses line between trying to mix up
 
06:58:05.310 --> 06:58:05.320 align:start position:0%
warranty and
 
06:58:07.990 --> 06:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
liability warranty is something that's
 
06:58:09.590 --> 06:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
provided by every responsible gun
 
06:58:10.788 --> 06:58:10.798 align:start position:0%
manufacturer whether it be in New
 
06:58:12.150 --> 06:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or outside the state of New
 
06:58:13.948 --> 06:58:13.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's already addressed with
 
06:58:15.830 --> 06:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
a faulty product a company will call a
 
06:58:17.510 --> 06:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
recall they'll put out a batch of
 
06:58:19.230 --> 06:58:19.240 align:start position:0%
numbers usually that falls within a
 
06:58:21.270 --> 06:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
certain parameter they'll pay for the uh
 
06:58:22.788 --> 06:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
individuals to ship those fire back
 
06:58:24.708 --> 06:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
correct the problem or replace it that's
 
06:58:26.910 --> 06:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
warranty this limited liability that's
 
06:58:29.030 --> 06:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
been brought up is mostly designed to
 
06:58:31.190 --> 06:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
chip away at the gun industry that's
 
06:58:34.430 --> 06:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it does not it
 
06:58:37.708 --> 06:58:37.718 align:start position:0%
repeals the protections from gun dealers
 
06:58:39.868 --> 06:58:39.878 align:start position:0%
we don't hold criminals accountable that
 
06:58:41.230 --> 06:58:41.240 align:start position:0%
is our number one problem and I also
 
06:58:42.990 --> 06:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
serve on the criminal justice committee
 
06:58:45.310 --> 06:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
with representative Muse and we differ
 
06:58:47.750 --> 06:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
think on opinions on accountability if
 
06:58:49.230 --> 06:58:49.240 align:start position:0%
an individual commits a crime such as
 
06:58:50.510 --> 06:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
breaking into your house to steal a
 
06:58:53.150 --> 06:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
firearm they then commit a murder if
 
06:58:56.070 --> 06:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
committed two crimes how is that sterm
 
06:58:58.590 --> 06:58:58.600 align:start position:0%
ruger's fault if it's a Ruger fire
 
06:59:00.310 --> 06:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
should they be sued for two criminal
 
06:59:02.150 --> 06:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
acts committed by a criminal should the
 
06:59:03.948 --> 06:59:03.958 align:start position:0%
criminal not be held accountable for
 
06:59:06.750 --> 06:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
their acts that's what I look at when
 
06:59:08.388 --> 06:59:08.398 align:start position:0%
looking at some of these laws that we
 
06:59:10.510 --> 06:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
keep trying to generate will this make
 
06:59:12.468 --> 06:59:12.478 align:start position:0%
the public safer and I think we've heard
 
06:59:14.110 --> 06:59:14.120 align:start position:0%
today that it probably won't make the
 
06:59:16.350 --> 06:59:16.360 align:start position:0%
public safer but what it will do is
 
06:59:17.788 --> 06:59:17.798 align:start position:0%
it'll impact the Firearms industry in
 
06:59:19.430 --> 06:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I'm not sure if you
 
06:59:21.628 --> 06:59:21.638 align:start position:0%
folks are aware of how many
 
06:59:25.150 --> 06:59:25.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturers jobs are tied in to
 
06:59:27.430 --> 06:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
Firearms now you mostly in New Hampshire
 
06:59:29.070 --> 06:59:29.080 align:start position:0%
we think of Sig being the largest one I
 
06:59:30.350 --> 06:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
believe that we currently have then you
 
06:59:32.590 --> 06:59:32.600 align:start position:0%
have Ruger that's the second largest but
 
06:59:33.830 --> 06:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
what about all the smaller companies
 
06:59:35.670 --> 06:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
that are making firearms and the people
 
06:59:37.230 --> 06:59:37.240 align:start position:0%
they employ whether it's an aerospace
 
06:59:40.070 --> 06:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
company in clamont a manufacturing CNC
 
06:59:42.030 --> 06:59:42.040 align:start position:0%
operation in Newport these are
 
06:59:44.548 --> 06:59:44.558 align:start position:0%
livelihood I can tell you that clamont
 
06:59:47.310 --> 06:59:47.320 align:start position:0%
Newport Sun they all have individuals
 
06:59:48.750 --> 06:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
that work at strm Ruger do we want to
 
06:59:50.430 --> 06:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
see strm Ruger say you know what New
 
06:59:51.708 --> 06:59:51.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just repealed us this is
 
06:59:52.910 --> 06:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
another reason why we should think about
 
06:59:55.350 --> 06:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
moving our operation out of state we
 
06:59:57.150 --> 06:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
can't afford to lose 900 jobs in our
 
06:59:59.548 --> 06:59:59.558 align:start position:0%
area especially over failure to hold
 
07:00:01.270 --> 07:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
criminals accountable and trying to hold
 
07:00:02.830 --> 07:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
the individuals that work at these
 
07:00:04.788 --> 07:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
facilities that could be in Jeopardy if
 
07:00:06.788 --> 07:00:06.798 align:start position:0%
they end up being moved to say down
 
07:00:08.830 --> 07:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
south I know Ruger has uh established a
 
07:00:11.350 --> 07:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
factory in Maiden I believe it's South
 
07:00:13.468 --> 07:00:13.478 align:start position:0%
Carolina they find it easier to find
 
07:00:15.750 --> 07:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
labor down there the cost of materials
 
07:00:17.948 --> 07:00:17.958 align:start position:0%
produc are cheaper down there energy
 
07:00:20.150 --> 07:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
rates are cheaper New England's very
 
07:00:21.708 --> 07:00:21.718 align:start position:0%
hard to start up manufacturing and I
 
07:00:23.190 --> 07:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
think we're very privileged that Sig
 
07:00:25.070 --> 07:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
decided to take a Gamble and bring their
 
07:00:26.388 --> 07:00:26.398 align:start position:0%
entire operation here since they're an
 
07:00:27.788 --> 07:00:27.798 align:start position:0%
international company they're not just a
 
07:00:30.910 --> 07:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
domestic company in the end I see this
 
07:00:32.230 --> 07:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
bill as being something that should be
 
07:00:36.468 --> 07:00:36.478 align:start position:0%
ited I don't think uh restricting
 
07:00:39.350 --> 07:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
individuals from suing uh a third party
 
07:00:43.350 --> 07:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
for a criminal act is viable and uh I'm
 
07:00:44.548 --> 07:00:44.558 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions that
 
07:00:48.030 --> 07:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
anyone might have questions for this
 
07:00:50.350 --> 07:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
07:00:52.628 --> 07:00:52.638 align:start position:0%
sir thank you for your time thank you
 
07:01:07.070 --> 07:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:09.070 --> 07:01:09.080 align:start position:0%
Hannon good evening Mr chairman and
 
07:01:10.910 --> 07:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh my name is
 
07:01:12.190 --> 07:01:12.200 align:start position:0%
joeann and I'm the vice president for
 
07:01:13.670 --> 07:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
gun owners of New Hampshire and we stand
 
07:01:17.150 --> 07:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
in opposition to HB uh
 
07:01:19.230 --> 07:01:19.240 align:start position:0%
1037 um there were a few points I'd like
 
07:01:21.430 --> 07:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
to make uh that were brought up early
 
07:01:25.150 --> 07:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
I'd like to discuss um one was uh that
 
07:01:27.110 --> 07:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
there's you know no other industry we've
 
07:01:30.548 --> 07:01:30.558 align:start position:0%
heard about um the vaccine industry also
 
07:01:32.230 --> 07:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
the airline industry and internet
 
07:01:34.270 --> 07:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
service providers are also immune from
 
07:01:36.310 --> 07:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
defamation and other um other things
 
07:01:38.948 --> 07:01:38.958 align:start position:0%
that they do uh so they're not the only
 
07:01:41.430 --> 07:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
ones uh we also heard about what public
 
07:01:43.990 --> 07:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
benefit why is this necessary if you sue
 
07:01:46.670 --> 07:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
an industry and prices go up you
 
07:01:49.310 --> 07:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
actually put the price of uh buying a
 
07:01:51.270 --> 07:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
firearm or some product out of the reach
 
07:01:53.230 --> 07:01:53.240 align:start position:0%
of many lowering inome and maybe not
 
07:01:55.910 --> 07:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
lower inome people uh that's that's
 
07:01:57.948 --> 07:01:57.958 align:start position:0%
definitely something it may be indirect
 
07:01:59.230 --> 07:01:59.240 align:start position:0%
but it is definitely something that has
 
07:02:01.510 --> 07:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
a direct effect on someone's right to
 
07:02:03.948 --> 07:02:03.958 align:start position:0%
exercise their second amendment rights
 
07:02:05.510 --> 07:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
also it can pose a danger to the
 
07:02:06.628 --> 07:02:06.638 align:start position:0%
Readiness of the United States for
 
07:02:08.030 --> 07:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
National Defense if we start suing all
 
07:02:09.628 --> 07:02:09.638 align:start position:0%
the gun manufacturers what are our
 
07:02:12.708 --> 07:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
soldiers going to fight with you know uh
 
07:02:14.590 --> 07:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
that's another large thing that often
 
07:02:16.750 --> 07:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
gets overlooked uh the reason why these
 
07:02:18.430 --> 07:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
laws are often brought about these
 
07:02:20.750 --> 07:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
repeal laws is because they want to go
 
07:02:22.070 --> 07:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
after the gun manufacturers and have
 
07:02:23.670 --> 07:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
less Firearms we've heard this multiple
 
07:02:25.190 --> 07:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
times the former mayor of Bridgeport
 
07:02:26.750 --> 07:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
Connecticut he said that they're trying
 
07:02:28.468 --> 07:02:28.478 align:start position:0%
to create laws with litigation he sued
 
07:02:30.628 --> 07:02:30.638 align:start position:0%
multiple gun manufacturers the HUD
 
07:02:32.350 --> 07:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
secretary Andrew Cuomo also was trying
 
07:02:34.030 --> 07:02:34.040 align:start position:0%
to get uh gun manufacturers to
 
07:02:36.190 --> 07:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
voluntarily adopt uh locks and other
 
07:02:38.270 --> 07:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
things in their um in their
 
07:02:40.670 --> 07:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturing processes and they said
 
07:02:42.270 --> 07:02:42.280 align:start position:0%
that if they don't the gun manufacturers
 
07:02:44.468 --> 07:02:44.478 align:start position:0%
would quote suffer death by a Thousand
 
07:02:46.708 --> 07:02:46.718 align:start position:0%
Cuts end quote Elliott Spitzer said
 
07:02:48.070 --> 07:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
those who don't comply would have
 
07:02:50.868 --> 07:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy lawyers knocking at their
 
07:02:54.830 --> 07:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
doors so um real quick I'd also like to
 
07:02:58.030 --> 07:02:58.040 align:start position:0%
talk about briefly um the incentives for
 
07:02:59.510 --> 07:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
things like smart guns and we're not
 
07:03:01.468 --> 07:03:01.478 align:start position:0%
allowing that to happen if something is
 
07:03:03.670 --> 07:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
a good workable product that people want
 
07:03:05.990 --> 07:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
the market will respond the reason why
 
07:03:08.110 --> 07:03:08.120 align:start position:0%
you don't see smart gun Manufacturing in
 
07:03:09.990 --> 07:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
the way that we might have we've we've
 
07:03:12.110 --> 07:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
heard about is because they they're
 
07:03:13.628 --> 07:03:13.638 align:start position:0%
they're extremely limited they're not a
 
07:03:15.548 --> 07:03:15.558 align:start position:0%
good product they're very prone to break
 
07:03:17.948 --> 07:03:17.958 align:start position:0%
a firearm is a pretty simple uh device
 
07:03:20.350 --> 07:03:20.360 align:start position:0%
you pull the trigger it goes off I
 
07:03:21.670 --> 07:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to have fire extinguishers
 
07:03:23.150 --> 07:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
my house house that only worked if I was
 
07:03:24.868 --> 07:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
the only one capable of taking it and
 
07:03:27.310 --> 07:03:27.320 align:start position:0%
using it to save my own life that is
 
07:03:29.670 --> 07:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
ridiculous we also heard about cars if
 
07:03:31.868 --> 07:03:31.878 align:start position:0%
they're too fast or too big and powerful
 
07:03:34.548 --> 07:03:34.558 align:start position:0%
they could be dangerous now I'd love to
 
07:03:36.590 --> 07:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
have a truck that went 200 mil hour I I
 
07:03:38.590 --> 07:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
can't afford one but there's a smart car
 
07:03:40.150 --> 07:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
you've all seen those little smart cars
 
07:03:41.910 --> 07:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
some may have one I don't know they
 
07:03:44.388 --> 07:03:44.398 align:start position:0%
average between 1,500 and you know under
 
07:03:46.708 --> 07:03:46.718 align:start position:0%
3,000 lb for a Smart car so say at the
 
07:03:49.548 --> 07:03:49.558 align:start position:0%
lowest number 1500 lb going at 20 M an
 
07:03:51.910 --> 07:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
hour if you use the formula to decide
 
07:03:53.310 --> 07:03:53.320 align:start position:0%
how much to find out how much energy
 
07:03:55.070 --> 07:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
that produces when it hits
 
07:03:59.948 --> 07:03:59.958 align:start position:0%
someone it's about um 27,000 jewles a 9
 
07:03:59.958 --> 07:04:01.110 align:start position:0%
someone it's about um 27,000 jewles a 9
millimeter

07:04:01.110 --> 07:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
millimeter
 
07:04:04.150 --> 07:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
bullet traveling at about a th000 me uh
 
07:04:06.868 --> 07:04:06.878 align:start position:0%
feet per second which is pretty standard
 
07:04:10.388 --> 07:04:10.398 align:start position:0%
is 346 Jews of energy that's 80 times
 
07:04:12.948 --> 07:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
more energy than a smart car a Smart car
 
07:04:14.590 --> 07:04:14.600 align:start position:0%
going only 20 miles hour if that same
 
07:04:16.788 --> 07:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
smart car goes 55 miles hour since the
 
07:04:19.150 --> 07:04:19.160 align:start position:0%
formula is masstimes velocity Square
 
07:04:22.110 --> 07:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
halftimes Mass velocity squared at 55
 
07:04:25.030 --> 07:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
mph this little dinky smart car has
 
07:04:27.910 --> 07:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
25,6 57 jewles of
 
07:04:31.990 --> 07:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
energy okay that is 594 times more
 
07:04:35.310 --> 07:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
powerful than a single 9mm bullet so
 
07:04:36.548 --> 07:04:36.558 align:start position:0%
we're we're not comparing apples and
 
07:04:38.510 --> 07:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
oranges we're comparing apples and like
 
07:04:38.520 --> 07:04:39.788 align:start position:0%
oranges we're comparing apples and like
blue

07:04:39.788 --> 07:04:39.798 align:start position:0%
blue
 
07:04:42.270 --> 07:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
whales um you know and as far as
 
07:04:43.510 --> 07:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity for government
 
07:04:45.190 --> 07:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
officials and law enforcement I'm not
 
07:04:46.430 --> 07:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
going to get into that debate or take a
 
07:04:48.150 --> 07:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
position on it but I will say that
 
07:04:50.510 --> 07:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity actually protects uh
 
07:04:52.350 --> 07:04:52.360 align:start position:0%
people when they are potentially
 
07:04:53.948 --> 07:04:53.958 align:start position:0%
breaking the law or in violation of
 
07:04:56.388 --> 07:04:56.398 align:start position:0%
someone's rights uh in the in the
 
07:04:58.868 --> 07:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
furtherance of their their legal duties
 
07:05:00.310 --> 07:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
if someone is breaking the law in a
 
07:05:02.030 --> 07:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturer whether it's Firearms or
 
07:05:03.388 --> 07:05:03.398 align:start position:0%
anything else they are still able to be
 
07:05:05.070 --> 07:05:05.080 align:start position:0%
sued if they make a faulty product if
 
07:05:06.350 --> 07:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
they make something with deceptive
 
07:05:08.468 --> 07:05:08.478 align:start position:0%
practices there are long list of things
 
07:05:09.750 --> 07:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
that they can be sued for and held
 
07:05:11.948 --> 07:05:11.958 align:start position:0%
liable for so uh I think this is an
 
07:05:13.948 --> 07:05:13.958 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary uh bill for
 
07:05:15.350 --> 07:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
preserving people's second amendment
 
07:05:17.750 --> 07:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
rights and for uh preserving National
 
07:05:20.548 --> 07:05:20.558 align:start position:0%
Defense more than just the economy of
 
07:05:22.110 --> 07:05:22.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so there's there's many
 
07:05:25.110 --> 07:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
reasons this needs to be um ited I'd be
 
07:05:26.750 --> 07:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions questions
 
07:05:28.230 --> 07:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
for this
 
07:05:30.350 --> 07:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
witness yes

witness being none thank you very much

sir thank you all next um I'm going to

uh call on
 
07:06:00.430 --> 07:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
Kimberly Mor from the uh women's Defense

is hello my name is Kim oh that was a
 
07:06:07.990 --> 07:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
little bit harder of see you guys need
 
07:06:10.190 --> 07:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
some questioning over here um I'm gonna
 
07:06:11.750 --> 07:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm Kimberly Moren president of the
 
07:06:14.310 --> 07:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
women's Defense League um our members
 
07:06:16.708 --> 07:06:16.718 align:start position:0%
are we represent members from all over
 
07:06:20.388 --> 07:06:20.398 align:start position:0%
the state women um Firearms
 
07:06:22.590 --> 07:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturers manufactur inanimate
 
07:06:24.948 --> 07:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
objects I think we've established that
 
07:06:27.030 --> 07:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
the objects themselves do nothing
 
07:06:29.750 --> 07:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
without human interaction and if they do
 
07:06:31.830 --> 07:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
we've already established the Firearms
 
07:06:34.910 --> 07:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturers can be suit somehow the
 
07:06:36.750 --> 07:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill believe
 
07:06:38.910 --> 07:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturers should be held responsible
 
07:06:41.230 --> 07:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
for what a human does with their
 
07:06:44.270 --> 07:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
inanimate product after they purchase it
 
07:06:46.708 --> 07:06:46.718 align:start position:0%
of course this bill makes zero cents
 
07:06:48.830 --> 07:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
what's next holding automobile
 
07:06:50.510 --> 07:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturers liable for the actions of
 
07:06:52.150 --> 07:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
drunk drivers which we already talked
 
07:06:54.388 --> 07:06:54.398 align:start position:0%
about as well what about holding knife
 
07:06:56.388 --> 07:06:56.398 align:start position:0%
manufacturers liable for the actions of
 
07:06:58.430 --> 07:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
a criminal who stabs someone or what
 
07:07:00.430 --> 07:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
about match manufacturers responsible
 
07:07:02.708 --> 07:07:02.718 align:start position:0%
for a person who commits arson I think
 
07:07:05.590 --> 07:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
you get the point this legislation is
 
07:07:07.468 --> 07:07:07.478 align:start position:0%
nothing but an attempt to put firearm
 
07:07:09.868 --> 07:07:09.878 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and Distributors out of
 
07:07:12.628 --> 07:07:12.638 align:start position:0%
business or to make Firearms so
 
07:07:14.270 --> 07:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
expensive granted saders won't be able
 
07:07:16.590 --> 07:07:16.600 align:start position:0%
to afford to practice their fundamental
 
07:07:18.548 --> 07:07:18.558 align:start position:0%
human right to self-defense which we
 
07:07:21.310 --> 07:07:21.320 align:start position:0%
also admitted for first that that second
 
07:07:24.430 --> 07:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
me is our right representative Smith
 
07:07:25.788 --> 07:07:25.798 align:start position:0%
actually called it out when she talked
 
07:07:29.628 --> 07:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
about the elephant in the room by saying
 
07:07:32.350 --> 07:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
they wanted to limit access to firearms
 
07:07:34.030 --> 07:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
and implying that this bill would do
 
07:07:36.628 --> 07:07:36.638 align:start position:0%
just that please vote inexpedient to
 
07:07:38.750 --> 07:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
legislate on this ridiculous
 
07:07:42.628 --> 07:07:42.638 align:start position:0%
Bill questions for this week seeing none
 
07:07:45.270 --> 07:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you next uh Katherine
 
07:07:45.280 --> 07:07:50.430 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you next uh Katherine
gens

please

07:07:55.670 --> 07:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:57.708 --> 07:07:57.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh members of
 
07:08:00.708 --> 07:08:00.718 align:start position:0%

07:08:06.430 --> 07:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
succinctly and actually summed up all of
 
07:08:08.750 --> 07:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
my points so perhaps I can make this a
 
07:08:11.270 --> 07:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
little bit shorter um my name is
 
07:08:13.628 --> 07:08:13.638 align:start position:0%
Katherine giddens I am a lawful
 
07:08:15.750 --> 07:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
permanent resident here I'm a
 
07:08:19.468 --> 07:08:19.478 align:start position:0%
competitive shooter and I'm also a New
 
07:08:22.150 --> 07:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's very new dur director of a
 
07:08:25.590 --> 07:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
group called women for gun rights um who
 
07:08:28.468 --> 07:08:28.478 align:start position:0%
like the women's Defense League um Works
 
07:08:32.510 --> 07:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
to educate and Advocate and to preserve
 
07:08:36.030 --> 07:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
um the legacy of the Great American uh
 
07:08:38.628 --> 07:08:38.638 align:start position:0%
right to bear arms and uh I'm just here
 
07:08:41.388 --> 07:08:41.398 align:start position:0%
today to maybe just make a couple of
 
07:08:43.708 --> 07:08:43.718 align:start position:0%
observations now that the most obvious
 
07:08:47.868 --> 07:08:47.878 align:start position:0%
points have been brought forward and um
 
07:08:50.830 --> 07:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
in particular the um issue of personal
 
07:08:50.840 --> 07:08:52.510 align:start position:0%
in particular the um issue of personal
accountability

07:08:52.510 --> 07:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
07:08:55.948 --> 07:08:55.958 align:start position:0%
um which in a funny little way little
 
07:08:59.590 --> 07:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
bit ironic maybe a little bit sad um
 
07:09:02.030 --> 07:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
Senator Ella last week when speaking to
 
07:09:05.948 --> 07:09:05.958 align:start position:0%
Bill 360 actually gave the most perfect
 
07:09:08.190 --> 07:09:08.200 align:start position:0%
example of personal accountability when
 
07:09:10.628 --> 07:09:10.638 align:start position:0%
referencing a pen that was across the
 
07:09:13.430 --> 07:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
desk which uh she mentioned very
 
07:09:16.670 --> 07:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
correctly would do nothing unless she
 
07:09:19.350 --> 07:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
reached out picked it up and began to
 
07:09:20.310 --> 07:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
write with
 
07:09:26.388 --> 07:09:26.398 align:start position:0%
it everybody acts to write a hand is
 
07:09:28.868 --> 07:09:28.878 align:start position:0%
controlled by a mind I don't need to say
 
07:09:31.110 --> 07:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
this really with a will to write
 
07:09:33.830 --> 07:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
something maybe something loving maybe
 
07:09:36.190 --> 07:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
something kind maybe something hurtful
 
07:09:39.430 --> 07:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
maybe a lie and lies destroy
 
07:09:43.590 --> 07:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
lives and they harm people and this
 
07:09:46.310 --> 07:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
bill I
 
07:09:49.270 --> 07:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
believe is
 
07:09:51.910 --> 07:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
presented there is a smoke screen
 
07:09:56.270 --> 07:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
here there is an overreach here that is
 
07:09:58.750 --> 07:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
hidden under a blanket
 
07:10:02.468 --> 07:10:02.478 align:start position:0%
of community interest and the interest
 
07:10:04.548 --> 07:10:04.558 align:start position:0%
of well we're here in the interest of
 
07:10:07.548 --> 07:10:07.558 align:start position:0%
granite Staters but as it's been pointed
 
07:10:09.830 --> 07:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
out the interest of the majority of
 
07:10:13.150 --> 07:10:13.160 align:start position:0%
granite Staters is to enjoy the
 
07:10:15.708 --> 07:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
freedom that they have here as part of
 
07:10:18.590 --> 07:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
the Live Free or Die State and the
 
07:10:20.830 --> 07:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
industries the firearm industry here
 
07:10:22.910 --> 07:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
within 50 miles of here there are up to
 
07:10:24.868 --> 07:10:24.878 align:start position:0%
30 small
 
07:10:27.510 --> 07:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
businesses um independent operators
 
07:10:29.990 --> 07:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
family multigenerational family run
 
07:10:32.590 --> 07:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
businesses that their livelihoods are
 
07:10:36.150 --> 07:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
sourced from the Firearms industry and
 
07:10:39.948 --> 07:10:39.958 align:start position:0%
the state itself in some part uh derives
 
07:10:43.708 --> 07:10:43.718 align:start position:0%
his livelihood from this industry um I
 
07:10:45.430 --> 07:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
just recently learned that a couple of
 
07:10:49.070 --> 07:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
years ago before I uh began long before
 
07:10:50.670 --> 07:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
I actually I began this journey just a
 
07:10:52.350 --> 07:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks ago so bear with me
 
07:10:55.708 --> 07:10:55.718 align:start position:0%
please while I while I get my feet um a
 
07:10:59.750 --> 07:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago Sig won a contract
 
07:11:02.350 --> 07:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
to manufacture the arms for the uh arms
 
07:11:06.350 --> 07:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
and Munitions for the the US Army um Sig
 
07:11:08.830 --> 07:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
being uh with pistols I think they take
 
07:11:12.750 --> 07:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
the top two spots of most uh last year
 
07:11:14.750 --> 07:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
they were the top two for most popular
 
07:11:18.468 --> 07:11:18.478 align:start position:0%
pistols Ruger as well um top one and two
 
07:11:21.670 --> 07:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
spots for popular um shotguns both
 
07:11:24.310 --> 07:11:24.320 align:start position:0%

businesses and um in a little
 
07:11:51.868 --> 07:11:51.878 align:start position:0%
interesting twist um uh senator shien
 
07:11:54.830 --> 07:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
actually applauded our Firearms industry
 
07:11:57.628 --> 07:11:57.638 align:start position:0%
here uh when she said um I'll just do a
 
07:12:00.310 --> 07:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
little uh quote here um this contract
 
07:12:02.628 --> 07:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
this is with Sig this contract reaffirms
 
07:12:04.750 --> 07:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
the powerful role that the granite state
 
07:12:06.548 --> 07:12:06.558 align:start position:0%
businesses play in support of Our
 
07:12:08.708 --> 07:12:08.718 align:start position:0%

role in safeguarding our troops with
 
07:12:23.788 --> 07:12:23.798 align:start position:0%
every Federal contract of this nature
 
07:12:25.948 --> 07:12:25.958 align:start position:0%
comes jobs and economic growth in the
 
07:12:28.350 --> 07:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
region which Granite State communities
 
07:12:30.990 --> 07:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
need now more than ever as we rebuild
 
07:12:33.548 --> 07:12:33.558 align:start position:0%
from the financial Fallout of covid and
 
07:12:35.628 --> 07:12:35.638 align:start position:0%

07:12:38.150 --> 07:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
challenges this generational investment
 
07:12:40.070 --> 07:12:40.080 align:start position:0%

07:12:41.868 --> 07:12:41.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire jobs and ensure the
 
07:12:44.150 --> 07:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
granite state remains at the Forefront

07:12:48.388 --> 07:12:48.398 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is renowned for its
 
07:12:50.430 --> 07:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturing capabilities in support of
 
07:12:52.270 --> 07:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
national product priorities from the
 
07:12:54.430 --> 07:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
defense sector to the Aerospace industry
 
07:12:57.590 --> 07:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
and Beyond I'm thrilled sigar is further
 
07:13:00.750 --> 07:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
bolstering our state's proud reputation
 
07:13:04.030 --> 07:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
that is um from
 
07:13:07.868 --> 07:13:07.878 align:start position:0%
2022 and it's what is so damaging about
 
07:13:09.990 --> 07:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
this bill if it's passed the granite
 
07:13:12.948 --> 07:13:12.958 align:start position:0%
state is suffer and my heart honestly
 
07:13:17.070 --> 07:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
does um go out to victims of unlawful
 
07:13:20.670 --> 07:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
use of firearms and victims of crime and
 
07:13:22.750 --> 07:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
super suicides it's it's a terrible
 
07:13:24.990 --> 07:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
terrible situation and it's a terrible
 
07:13:27.468 --> 07:13:27.478 align:start position:0%
reality that we all live with but this
 
07:13:28.910 --> 07:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
07:13:31.468 --> 07:13:31.478 align:start position:0%
Bill it doesn't
 
07:13:34.708 --> 07:13:34.718 align:start position:0%
benefit the most people it hurts the
 
07:13:37.708 --> 07:13:37.718 align:start position:0%
most people it hurts Granite status um
 
07:13:39.948 --> 07:13:39.958 align:start position:0%
hard workers people who love their guns
 
07:13:42.350 --> 07:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
people who love their freedom and I
 
07:13:45.708 --> 07:13:45.718 align:start position:0%
think it's ethically wrong I think it's
 
07:13:48.830 --> 07:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
logically wrong to pass this sort of
 
07:13:51.590 --> 07:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
Bill and I would urge you
 
07:13:54.990 --> 07:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
to um not support it and that's all I
 
07:13:57.190 --> 07:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
have to say on that thank you questions
 
07:14:00.070 --> 07:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
for this witness seeing none thank you
 
07:14:01.590 --> 07:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
very much thank you very next I'm going
 
07:14:14.750 --> 07:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:17.468 --> 07:14:17.478 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
07:14:19.708 --> 07:14:19.718 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
07:14:22.230 --> 07:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony I do have prepared
 
07:14:24.830 --> 07:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
testimony in consideration of the hour I
 
07:14:28.350 --> 07:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
will not repeat not read it uh thank
 
07:14:31.350 --> 07:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you you're we will read it but you
 
07:14:32.670 --> 07:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
don't have to you don't have to read it
 
07:14:34.070 --> 07:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
yourself what I will do though is hit
 
07:14:37.468 --> 07:14:37.478 align:start position:0%
some of the main points because there
 
07:14:40.270 --> 07:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
are unanswered
 
07:14:42.230 --> 07:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
questions I want to begin with a
 
07:14:46.230 --> 07:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
foundational fact at the end of
 
07:14:49.830 --> 07:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
2022 there were in the United States
 
07:14:53.510 --> 07:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
approximately four 474 million
 
07:14:56.510 --> 07:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
firearms in my written testimony I
 
07:15:00.230 --> 07:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
explain where that number comes from but
 
07:15:03.910 --> 07:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
anyone who can do basic math should
 
07:15:08.230 --> 07:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
understand that the ship of gun control
 
07:15:13.070 --> 07:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
sailed years and years ago anything that
 
07:15:16.388 --> 07:15:16.398 align:start position:0%
numerous and mainly concealable cannot
 
07:15:20.150 --> 07:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
be controlled the effort is for doomed I
 
07:15:22.310 --> 07:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
understand some people people are blind
 
07:15:24.708 --> 07:15:24.718 align:start position:0%
to the reality I just set
 
07:15:29.110 --> 07:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
forth further the notion that background
 
07:15:31.708 --> 07:15:31.718 align:start position:0%
checks stop folks who shouldn't have
 
07:15:33.990 --> 07:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
guns from getting them by virtue of the
 
07:15:37.990 --> 07:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
point I just made is plainly
 
07:15:40.868 --> 07:15:40.878 align:start position:0%
absurd the number of folks who want to
 
07:15:43.468 --> 07:15:43.478 align:start position:0%
get firearms and abuse them in the
 
07:15:45.750 --> 07:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
United States might be a few
 
07:15:48.388 --> 07:15:48.398 align:start position:0%
million they're roughly even if they're
 
07:15:52.310 --> 07:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
10 million they're 47 firearms for every
 
07:15:56.310 --> 07:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
such person the likelihood of any law
 
07:15:58.468 --> 07:15:58.478 align:start position:0%
that you or anyone else can enact
 
07:16:00.788 --> 07:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
stopping those folks isn't
 
07:16:03.830 --> 07:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
zero I'm an economist as well as a gun
 
07:16:07.830 --> 07:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:07.840 --> 07:16:11.670 align:start position:0%
 
close

07:16:11.670 --> 07:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:15.350 --> 07:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
second many presume that gun control is
 
07:16:18.910 --> 07:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
a prere a prerequisite for Public Safety
 
07:16:21.910 --> 07:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
this is simply not said
 
07:16:24.270 --> 07:16:24.280 align:start position:0%
at least since
 
07:16:27.388 --> 07:16:27.398 align:start position:0%
2001 Maine New
 
07:16:31.590 --> 07:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Vermont have with a single
 
07:16:35.190 --> 07:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
year exception 2015 been the three
 
07:16:38.270 --> 07:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
safest states in the union measured by
 
07:16:40.788 --> 07:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
the incidence of violent crime per
 
07:16:40.798 --> 07:16:42.868 align:start position:0%
the incidence of violent crime per
100,000

100,000
 
07:16:46.510 --> 07:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
residents the enactment of this bill and
 
07:16:46.520 --> 07:16:47.350 align:start position:0%
residents the enactment of this bill and
I'll

07:16:47.350 --> 07:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
I'll
 
07:16:47.360 --> 07:16:49.590 align:start position:0%
I'll
explain

07:16:49.590 --> 07:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
explain
 
07:16:53.310 --> 07:16:53.320 align:start position:0%
shortly what is the mechanism by which
 
07:16:56.190 --> 07:16:56.200 align:start position:0%
it will damage Public Safety the
 
07:16:58.788 --> 07:16:58.798 align:start position:0%
enactment of this bill will subvert
 
07:17:01.708 --> 07:17:01.718 align:start position:0%
Public Safety its proponents plainly
 
07:17:04.708 --> 07:17:04.718 align:start position:0%
want to live in a more dangerous State I
 
07:17:06.350 --> 07:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
suggest they move to
 
07:17:09.430 --> 07:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which has thickets of gun
 
07:17:09.440 --> 07:17:11.388 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which has thickets of gun
control

07:17:11.388 --> 07:17:11.398 align:start position:0%
control
 
07:17:15.070 --> 07:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
laws the incidence of violent crime in
 
07:17:18.590 --> 07:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts 2022 two and a half times
 
07:17:21.548 --> 07:17:21.558 align:start position:0%
that of New Hampshire and nearly treble
 
07:17:22.788 --> 07:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
that of
 
07:17:27.070 --> 07:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
Maine why would anyone in their right
 
07:17:31.310 --> 07:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
mind want to replicate here what exists
 
07:17:31.320 --> 07:17:32.310 align:start position:0%
mind want to replicate here what exists
in

07:17:32.310 --> 07:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
07:17:35.310 --> 07:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it's akin to someone
 
07:17:38.628 --> 07:17:38.638 align:start position:0%
catching a flight to Riyad Saudi Arabia
 
07:17:41.388 --> 07:17:41.398 align:start position:0%
going into a restaurant and then seeking
 
07:17:44.230 --> 07:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
an order of ham and
 
07:17:48.468 --> 07:17:48.478 align:start position:0%
eggs for those not aware Muslims do not
 
07:17:48.478 --> 07:17:49.510 align:start position:0%
eggs for those not aware Muslims do not
touch

07:17:49.510 --> 07:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
touch
 
07:17:52.910 --> 07:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
pork not in any shape not in any form
 
07:17:55.388 --> 07:17:55.398 align:start position:0%
I'm Jewish I can touch pork I simply
 
07:17:59.750 --> 07:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
can't eat it so a rational person would
 
07:18:02.948 --> 07:18:02.958 align:start position:0%
not go to Saudi Arabia and berak the
 
07:18:05.310 --> 07:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
chef for refusing to serve up an order
 
07:18:08.070 --> 07:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
of ham and eggs why would anyone come
 
07:18:12.270 --> 07:18:12.280 align:start position:0%
here who wants gun control it's
 
07:18:15.910 --> 07:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
irrational and truly it is now let me
 
07:18:18.070 --> 07:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
get to the I guess the heart of what I
 
07:18:19.510 --> 07:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
want to tell
 
07:18:19.520 --> 07:18:23.110 align:start position:0%
want to tell
you

07:18:23.110 --> 07:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:25.510 --> 07:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill is to do two
 
07:18:29.190 --> 07:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
things it is as some alluded to earlier
 
07:18:32.868 --> 07:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
to destroy businesses who make wholesale
 
07:18:34.948 --> 07:18:34.958 align:start position:0%
and sell
 
07:18:36.948 --> 07:18:36.958 align:start position:0%
firearms the
 
07:18:39.670 --> 07:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
mechanism as some have said is
 
07:18:42.190 --> 07:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
lawsuits what is missing from the
 
07:18:46.628 --> 07:18:46.638 align:start position:0%
equation is who is going to fund those
 
07:18:49.190 --> 07:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
lawsuits I have a really good idea what
 
07:18:51.708 --> 07:18:51.718 align:start position:0%
it costs to litigate
 
07:18:56.150 --> 07:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:59.868 --> 07:18:59.878 align:start position:0%
moment what I'm pretty sure is the most
 
07:19:02.590 --> 07:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
expensive Massachusetts non-resident
 
07:19:07.510 --> 07:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:10.270 --> 07:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
planet an earlier version of this
 
07:19:12.548 --> 07:19:12.558 align:start position:0%
license was sarily
 
07:19:17.310 --> 07:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:19.430 --> 07:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
$125,000 and about three and a half
 
07:19:21.628 --> 07:19:21.638 align:start position:0%
years of effort
 
07:19:24.830 --> 07:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
to get from the Supreme Judicial Court
 
07:19:24.840 --> 07:19:25.670 align:start position:0%
to get from the Supreme Judicial Court
of

07:19:25.670 --> 07:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:19:28.110 --> 07:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts an order restoring the
 
07:19:30.990 --> 07:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
license to me I broke no
 
07:19:34.590 --> 07:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
law I infringed no regulation and no
 
07:19:37.190 --> 07:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
charge was ever brought this gives you
 
07:19:40.190 --> 07:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
an idea what it cost to litigate and oh
 
07:19:43.510 --> 07:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
by the way Representatives I did most of
 
07:19:44.708 --> 07:19:44.718 align:start position:0%
the law
 
07:19:48.548 --> 07:19:48.558 align:start position:0%
research and legislative history
 
07:19:51.830 --> 07:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
research in order for my my very capable
 
07:19:55.788 --> 07:19:55.798 align:start position:0%
attorney to pursue the
 
07:20:01.670 --> 07:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:04.830 --> 07:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
expensive further disclosure I've been
 
07:20:07.270 --> 07:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
before the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
07:20:09.750 --> 07:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
as a non- attorney representative in a
 
07:20:12.388 --> 07:20:12.398 align:start position:0%
firearm related matter on behalf of a
 
07:20:12.398 --> 07:20:13.548 align:start position:0%
firearm related matter on behalf of a
fellow

07:20:13.548 --> 07:20:13.558 align:start position:0%
fellow
 
07:20:17.948 --> 07:20:17.958 align:start position:0%
nashan who had two firearm related
 
07:20:20.868 --> 07:20:20.878 align:start position:0%
licenses wrongly and unlawfully
 
07:20:23.708 --> 07:20:23.718 align:start position:0%
revoke I wrote I researched and wrote
 
07:20:26.548 --> 07:20:26.558 align:start position:0%
his brief it was the hardest thing I've
 
07:20:28.190 --> 07:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
done since I wrote my doctoral
 
07:20:32.548 --> 07:20:32.558 align:start position:0%
disertation and I hope never to do it
 
07:20:35.468 --> 07:20:35.478 align:start position:0%
again I as a non- attorney couldn't
 
07:20:37.270 --> 07:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
charge him and I wouldn't even if I
 
07:20:37.280 --> 07:20:38.190 align:start position:0%
charge him and I wouldn't even if I
could

07:20:38.190 --> 07:20:38.200 align:start position:0%
could
 
07:20:41.590 --> 07:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
have it took about a thousand hours over
 
07:20:43.310 --> 07:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
a couple of
 
07:20:46.510 --> 07:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
years my point is litigation is
 
07:20:49.750 --> 07:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
burdensome so here's the key point I
 
07:20:49.760 --> 07:20:51.190 align:start position:0%
burdensome so here's the key point I
believe

07:20:51.190 --> 07:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
believe
 
07:20:54.190 --> 07:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
that the backers of this
 
07:20:57.948 --> 07:20:57.958 align:start position:0%
bill implicitly or explicitly work on
 
07:20:59.788 --> 07:20:59.798 align:start position:0%
behalf of Michael
 
07:21:02.628 --> 07:21:02.638 align:start position:0%
Bloomberg Michael Bloomberg according to
 
07:21:06.708 --> 07:21:06.718 align:start position:0%
Forbes Magazine is the 14th wealthiest
 
07:21:09.868 --> 07:21:09.878 align:start position:0%
person on this planet his fortune
 
07:21:13.350 --> 07:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
according to Forbes is $96
 
07:21:16.990 --> 07:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
billion he Champions gun control and has
 
07:21:20.230 --> 07:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
done so for years and in my prepare test
 
07:21:22.868 --> 07:21:22.878 align:start position:0%
testimony I provide you with links to
 
07:21:22.878 --> 07:21:24.430 align:start position:0%
testimony I provide you with links to
his

07:21:24.430 --> 07:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
his
 
07:21:28.548 --> 07:21:28.558 align:start position:0%
website Mr Bloomberg is
 
07:21:32.270 --> 07:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
brilliant I give the devil his
 
07:21:35.388 --> 07:21:35.398 align:start position:0%
due I have told folks that the Nazi
 
07:21:39.150 --> 07:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
dictator wore on his uniform only one
 
07:21:42.150 --> 07:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
medal it was an iron cross that he
 
07:21:44.628 --> 07:21:44.638 align:start position:0%
earned legitimately as a Frontline
 
07:21:47.388 --> 07:21:47.398 align:start position:0%
fighter in World War
 
07:21:51.548 --> 07:21:51.558 align:start position:0%
I his air minister Herman
 
07:21:54.628 --> 07:21:54.638 align:start position:0%
guring had all kinds of medals but
 
07:21:58.910 --> 07:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
guring himself earned Imperial Germany's
 
07:22:01.548 --> 07:22:01.558 align:start position:0%
highest award guring was a a fighter
 
07:22:05.708 --> 07:22:05.718 align:start position:0%
pilot and an ace so even people whom I
 
07:22:07.750 --> 07:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
have little regard for that's a British
 
07:22:10.910 --> 07:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
style understatement nonetheless I'm
 
07:22:13.310 --> 07:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
constrained to tell the truth about and
 
07:22:15.548 --> 07:22:15.558 align:start position:0%
that is what I do
 
07:22:17.670 --> 07:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
here Mr
 
07:22:21.708 --> 07:22:21.718 align:start position:0%
Bloomberg has bottomless
 
07:22:26.388 --> 07:22:26.398 align:start position:0%
Pockets most firearm businesses
 
07:22:29.788 --> 07:22:29.798 align:start position:0%
Nationwide are either sole
 
07:22:32.310 --> 07:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
proprietorships or limited liability
 
07:22:35.430 --> 07:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
corporations they are not Mega
 
07:22:38.070 --> 07:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
firms Mr
 
07:22:41.788 --> 07:22:41.798 align:start position:0%
Bloomberg donated to his alma mater also
 
07:22:46.628 --> 07:22:46.638 align:start position:0%
my alma mater Johns Hopkins 1.8 billion
 
07:22:48.548 --> 07:22:48.558 align:start position:0%
that's with a B
 
07:22:53.350 --> 07:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:58.388 --> 07:22:58.398 align:start position:0%
University an entity devoted to quote
 
07:23:01.590 --> 07:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
researching gun violence end quote
 
07:23:04.628 --> 07:23:04.638 align:start position:0%
anyone who uses the term gun violence
 
07:23:09.110 --> 07:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
May fairly be deemed to be a rabidly
 
07:23:13.430 --> 07:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
anti-gun so in short were you to enact
 
07:23:16.990 --> 07:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
this bill it clears the way for Mr
 
07:23:21.468 --> 07:23:21.478 align:start position:0%
Bloomberg to bankrupt or or Force out of
 
07:23:22.990 --> 07:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
business for fear of
 
07:23:26.110 --> 07:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy anyone involved in firearms
 
07:23:27.468 --> 07:23:27.478 align:start position:0%
in this
 
07:23:27.478 --> 07:23:30.150 align:start position:0%
in this
state

07:23:30.150 --> 07:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
state
 
07:23:32.830 --> 07:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
now some might say well that's a good
 
07:23:35.070 --> 07:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
thing but I
 
07:23:39.948 --> 07:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
refer to you that the presence of
 
07:23:43.708 --> 07:23:43.718 align:start position:0%
firearms may have some power to explain
 
07:23:45.868 --> 07:23:45.878 align:start position:0%
why the incidence of violent crime in
 
07:23:48.948 --> 07:23:48.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is as low as it is we are
 
07:23:51.430 --> 07:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
now the second safest state in the Union
 
07:23:55.350 --> 07:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
Maine is number one and even when we got
 
07:23:58.590 --> 07:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
rid of compulsory licensure for
 
07:24:01.468 --> 07:24:01.478 align:start position:0%
concealed carry the incidents of violent
 
07:24:04.548 --> 07:24:04.558 align:start position:0%
crime in New Hampshire continued to
 
07:24:07.830 --> 07:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
fall the same thing is true in Maine
 
07:24:12.350 --> 07:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
which ended compulsory lure in
 
07:24:15.830 --> 07:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
2015 and Maine again was at that time
 
07:24:19.030 --> 07:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
still is safest state in the Union in
 
07:24:19.040 --> 07:24:22.910 align:start position:0%
still is safest state in the Union in
short

07:24:22.910 --> 07:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:25.110 --> 07:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
I go out on a thin limb and a high wind
 
07:24:28.190 --> 07:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
as an economist I do that a lot but I
 
07:24:30.948 --> 07:24:30.958 align:start position:0%
think the proponents of this bill have
 
07:24:34.270 --> 07:24:34.280 align:start position:0%
bluntly put been less than candid and I
 
07:24:37.070 --> 07:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
think that's wrong anyone who testifies
 
07:24:39.830 --> 07:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
before you just as they would in court
 
07:24:42.830 --> 07:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
has a duty of cander to the tribunal
 
07:24:46.270 --> 07:24:46.280 align:start position:0%
that Duty I have that Duty I have done
 
07:24:47.868 --> 07:24:47.878 align:start position:0%
and I will be happy to take any
 
07:24:50.030 --> 07:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have right
 
07:24:51.628 --> 07:24:51.638 align:start position:0%

Hawkins and I'm the state director of
 
07:25:28.150 --> 07:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
gunsense New Hampshire project of Grant
 
07:25:30.510 --> 07:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
State progress um we have tracked and
 
07:25:32.190 --> 07:25:32.200 align:start position:0%
waited on Firearms policy at the state
 
07:25:34.788 --> 07:25:34.798 align:start position:0%
level since 2009 and convene the New
 
07:25:36.308 --> 07:25:36.318 align:start position:0%
Hampshire gun violance prevention
 
07:25:38.548 --> 07:25:38.558 align:start position:0%
Coalition uh we support the bill before
 
07:25:40.868 --> 07:25:40.878 align:start position:0%
you with nearly every other industry in
 
07:25:43.468 --> 07:25:43.478 align:start position:0%
the United States Civil liability can be
 
07:25:44.868 --> 07:25:44.878 align:start position:0%
used as an important check on
 
07:25:46.910 --> 07:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
irresponsible and harmful industry
 
07:25:48.910 --> 07:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
behaviors but the gun industry has
 
07:25:51.070 --> 07:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
enjoyed enormous exemptions from
 
07:25:52.750 --> 07:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
liability and accountability in New
 
07:25:55.230 --> 07:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since 2003 and at the federal
 
07:25:58.548 --> 07:25:58.558 align:start position:0%
level since 2005 civil liability plays
 
07:26:01.430 --> 07:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
an important role in promoting community
 
07:26:03.990 --> 07:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
and consumer safety in circumstances
 
07:26:05.708 --> 07:26:05.718 align:start position:0%
where legislators have been unwilling to
 
07:26:07.590 --> 07:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
enact laws regulating a dangerous
 
07:26:09.628 --> 07:26:09.638 align:start position:0%
industry the possibility of civil
 
07:26:12.468 --> 07:26:12.478 align:start position:0%
litigation lawsuits can help incentivize
 
07:26:14.548 --> 07:26:14.558 align:start position:0%
Industries to take responsible steps to
 
07:26:16.468 --> 07:26:16.478 align:start position:0%
prevent their products or business
 
07:26:18.468 --> 07:26:18.478 align:start position:0%
practices from causing foreseeable risk
 
07:26:20.670 --> 07:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
to human life and well-being
 
07:26:22.070 --> 07:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
traditionally this means that victims
 
07:26:24.468 --> 07:26:24.478 align:start position:0%
harmed by wrongful industry conduct or
 
07:26:26.990 --> 07:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
public officials acting on the people's
 
07:26:28.788 --> 07:26:28.798 align:start position:0%
behalf can seek Fair Justice and
 
07:26:30.910 --> 07:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
accountability in the courts by filing
 
07:26:33.590 --> 07:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
lawsuits seeking monetary compensation
 
07:26:35.788 --> 07:26:35.798 align:start position:0%
or other court-ordered relief when
 
07:26:38.070 --> 07:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
Industries have negligently or
 
07:26:40.788 --> 07:26:40.798 align:start position:0%
recklessly caused harm or failed to take
 
07:26:43.070 --> 07:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
responsible steps to present foreseeable
 
07:26:44.948 --> 07:26:44.958 align:start position:0%
to prevent forceable harm I want to
 
07:26:47.350 --> 07:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
emphasize that when Industries have
 
07:26:49.910 --> 07:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
negligently or recklessly caused harm or
 
07:26:51.510 --> 07:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
failed to take reasonable steps to
 
07:26:54.830 --> 07:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
prevent foreseeable harm in too many
 
07:26:56.948 --> 07:26:56.958 align:start position:0%
cases however this principle does not
 
07:26:58.590 --> 07:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
apply to the Gund industry because the
 
07:27:00.750 --> 07:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
industry has obtained unprecedented
 
07:27:03.788 --> 07:27:03.798 align:start position:0%
immunity from the system of justice and
 
07:27:06.350 --> 07:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
accountability you heard earlier um
 
07:27:09.110 --> 07:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
about the federal law in the the what
 
07:27:11.750 --> 07:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
preceded that was that in the 1990s a
 
07:27:13.868 --> 07:27:13.878 align:start position:0%
series of lawsuits actually resulted in
 
07:27:16.190 --> 07:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
court judgments holding certain members
 
07:27:18.308 --> 07:27:18.318 align:start position:0%
of the Firearms industry liable for
 
07:27:21.308 --> 07:27:21.318 align:start position:0%
particularly Reckless practices but
 
07:27:23.308 --> 07:27:23.318 align:start position:0%
instead of comprehensively reforming its
 
07:27:25.590 --> 07:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
business practices and response the
 
07:27:27.708 --> 07:27:27.718 align:start position:0%
industry responded by lobbying to pass
 
07:27:30.110 --> 07:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
new gun industry immunity laws in States
 
07:27:32.670 --> 07:27:32.680 align:start position:0%
Across the Nation to prevent plaintiffs
 
07:27:34.468 --> 07:27:34.478 align:start position:0%
from bringing many types of lawsuits
 
07:27:36.110 --> 07:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
against firearms and ammunition
 
07:27:39.070 --> 07:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and sellers that passed at
 
07:27:41.788 --> 07:27:41.798 align:start position:0%
the federal level in 2005 and again at
 
07:27:45.868 --> 07:27:45.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:48.190 --> 07:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
2003 right now these legal immunities
 
07:27:49.708 --> 07:27:49.718 align:start position:0%
have helped to Shield this profitable
 
07:27:52.110 --> 07:27:52.120 align:start position:0%
industry from facing basic Financial
 
07:27:54.468 --> 07:27:54.478 align:start position:0%
incentives to better protect public
 
07:27:56.750 --> 07:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
health and safety too often they have
 
07:27:58.708 --> 07:27:58.718 align:start position:0%
encouraged a head in the sand behavior
 
07:28:01.150 --> 07:28:01.160 align:start position:0%
that shks any role for those
 
07:28:02.990 --> 07:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturing selling marketing or
 
07:28:05.110 --> 07:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
importing firearms and related products
 
07:28:07.388 --> 07:28:07.398 align:start position:0%
to identify dangerous patterns
 
07:28:10.030 --> 07:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
proactively change behaviors and Lead
 
07:28:12.628 --> 07:28:12.638 align:start position:0%
toward life-saving Innovations and
 
07:28:15.030 --> 07:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
solutions too often they've left victims
 
07:28:16.468 --> 07:28:16.478 align:start position:0%
of gun violence who are harmed by
 
07:28:18.788 --> 07:28:18.798 align:start position:0%
wrongful of firearm industry conduct
 
07:28:21.468 --> 07:28:21.478 align:start position:0%
without any measure of compensation or
 
07:28:23.830 --> 07:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
Justice these legal immunities also
 
07:28:26.190 --> 07:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
provide an unfair business advantage to
 
07:28:28.708 --> 07:28:28.718 align:start position:0%
irresponsible Firearms industry members
 
07:28:30.548 --> 07:28:30.558 align:start position:0%
over more responsible competitors who
 
07:28:32.750 --> 07:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
take stronger precautions to protect
 
07:28:34.270 --> 07:28:34.280 align:start position:0%
human life and
 
07:28:36.270 --> 07:28:36.280 align:start position:0%
well-being I want to draw to your
 
07:28:39.750 --> 07:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
attention um the example from the Sandy
 
07:28:43.150 --> 07:28:43.160 align:start position:0%
Hook shooting in February of 2022 after
 
07:28:45.190 --> 07:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
enduring years of litigation to
 
07:28:46.990 --> 07:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
establish their right to sue Firearms
 
07:28:48.868 --> 07:28:48.878 align:start position:0%
manufacturers under an exception to the
 
07:28:51.628 --> 07:28:51.638 align:start position:0%
Federal gun industry immunity law the
 
07:28:53.990 --> 07:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
families of the children and Educators
 
07:28:56.308 --> 07:28:56.318 align:start position:0%
murdered Sandy Hook Elementary School in
 
07:28:59.750 --> 07:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
2012 reached a record $73 million
 
07:29:01.190 --> 07:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
settlement with the
 
07:29:03.270 --> 07:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that made and marketed the
 
07:29:05.910 --> 07:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
shooters assault weapon but the same
 
07:29:07.190 --> 07:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
families had suffered the same
 
07:29:10.030 --> 07:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
unspeakable tragedy in many other states
 
07:29:11.548 --> 07:29:11.558 align:start position:0%
they may have never been able to seek
 
07:29:13.910 --> 07:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
Justice at all because of similar state
 
07:29:17.190 --> 07:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
level G gun industry immunity laws there
 
07:29:18.468 --> 07:29:18.478 align:start position:0%
were a lot of conversation in this
 
07:29:21.830 --> 07:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
committee today about other examples and
 
07:29:24.230 --> 07:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
I do think it is important that you do
 
07:29:27.110 --> 07:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
think about this from the product piece
 
07:29:30.948 --> 07:29:30.958 align:start position:0%
that this is an exception that every
 
07:29:33.430 --> 07:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
other nearly every other industry and
 
07:29:35.868 --> 07:29:35.878 align:start position:0%
product has some kind of liability and
 
07:29:38.150 --> 07:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
this is a very distinct special carve
 
07:29:40.910 --> 07:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
out for the gun industry that in itself
 
07:29:43.350 --> 07:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
is an admission that something is off
 
07:29:45.990 --> 07:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
right like if you are afraid to have
 
07:29:48.150 --> 07:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
them face the same consumer protections
 
07:29:50.230 --> 07:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
the same recourse the same Justice and
 
07:29:53.110 --> 07:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
accountability then something is not
 
07:29:57.948 --> 07:29:57.958 align:start position:0%
working we talked there is liability for
 
07:30:00.430 --> 07:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
those who serve over serve people who
 
07:30:01.830 --> 07:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
don't take steps to intervene when
 
07:30:04.190 --> 07:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
somebody's about to drunk to um drive
 
07:30:08.030 --> 07:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
drunk the opad crisis the manufacturing
 
07:30:11.548 --> 07:30:11.558 align:start position:0%
and selling marketing of those drugs has
 
07:30:13.948 --> 07:30:13.958 align:start position:0%
resulted in massive lawsuits and the
 
07:30:15.948 --> 07:30:15.958 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and cities across
 
07:30:19.030 --> 07:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
our state are um are benefiting from
 
07:30:21.670 --> 07:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
those do to restore the the loss of life
 
07:30:23.548 --> 07:30:23.558 align:start position:0%
and the costs that have been incurred by
 
07:30:26.150 --> 07:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
our community members this is just
 
07:30:28.110 --> 07:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
asking you to take away the special car
 
07:30:31.750 --> 07:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
vs for unlim uh for limited liability
 
07:30:35.150 --> 07:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
that the gun industry enjoys again it is
 
07:30:36.868 --> 07:30:36.878 align:start position:0%
an admission of guilt if you cannot go
 
07:30:38.990 --> 07:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
to a court of law and pursue these
 
07:30:41.388 --> 07:30:41.398 align:start position:0%
conversations because you're afraid that
 
07:30:43.708 --> 07:30:43.718 align:start position:0%
the ruling is going to go against the
 
07:30:46.590 --> 07:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
irresponsible practices and marketing of
 
07:30:48.350 --> 07:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
the gun
 
07:30:51.948 --> 07:30:51.958 align:start position:0%
industry when people talked about the um
 
07:30:55.070 --> 07:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
jobs and other things that also goes to
 
07:30:57.548 --> 07:30:57.558 align:start position:0%
my concern one I think it's really
 
07:30:58.948 --> 07:30:58.958 align:start position:0%
important to know that the gun industry
 
07:31:02.670 --> 07:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
does not lack for funds this is a record
 
07:31:05.510 --> 07:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
profit making industry but if folks are
 
07:31:07.590 --> 07:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
worried that being accountable to
 
07:31:09.990 --> 07:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
Consumers is some somehow going to cut
 
07:31:12.948 --> 07:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
into those costs it's because they know
 
07:31:15.708 --> 07:31:15.718 align:start position:0%
that the practices as they are right now
 
07:31:18.990 --> 07:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
are not safe for our community they know
 
07:31:22.350 --> 07:31:22.360 align:start position:0%
that they're will be wrongdoing found if
 
07:31:25.150 --> 07:31:25.160 align:start position:0%
people are able to go to the court you
 
07:31:27.788 --> 07:31:27.798 align:start position:0%
have two questions before you today the
 
07:31:30.030 --> 07:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
first is do you believe the gun industry
 
07:31:32.750 --> 07:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
should receive special legal immunity
 
07:31:34.910 --> 07:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
above and beyond other
 
07:31:37.110 --> 07:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
Industries we would say
 
07:31:39.548 --> 07:31:39.558 align:start position:0%
no the second is do you believe the gun
 
07:31:41.990 --> 07:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
industry has any role or responsibility
 
07:31:44.230 --> 07:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
in the manufacturing marketing and

card honorable members of committee uh
 
07:32:51.628 --> 07:32:51.638 align:start position:0%
my name is Justin Davis I represent the
 
07:32:53.868 --> 07:32:53.878 align:start position:0%
National Rifle Association I'm also a
 
07:32:55.788 --> 07:32:55.798 align:start position:0%
gun owner in New Hampshire I appreciate
 
07:32:56.948 --> 07:32:56.958 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to oppose this
 
07:32:59.510 --> 07:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
legislation today um I know it's late in
 
07:33:00.948 --> 07:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
the day you've had a marathon day of
 
07:33:02.548 --> 07:33:02.558 align:start position:0%
hearings and understanding that I am an
 
07:33:03.830 --> 07:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
obstacle between you and your warm
 
07:33:06.110 --> 07:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
supper on a cold January day I will be
 
07:33:08.788 --> 07:33:08.798 align:start position:0%
very brief um you know I think a lot of
 
07:33:09.990 --> 07:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
it's been discussed today we've talked
 
07:33:11.868 --> 07:33:11.878 align:start position:0%
about pla which is the uh proect
 
07:33:13.510 --> 07:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
protection of legal Commerce and arms
 
07:33:16.308 --> 07:33:16.318 align:start position:0%
act or lawful Commerce arms act rather
 
07:33:18.468 --> 07:33:18.478 align:start position:0%
um which is not only for gun
 
07:33:20.190 --> 07:33:20.200 align:start position:0%
manufacturers like we described as for
 
07:33:22.030 --> 07:33:22.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturing the United States so
 
07:33:23.990 --> 07:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
whether you're Ford whether you're Ruger
 
07:33:26.150 --> 07:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
whether you're Sig uh you all fall under
 
07:33:28.590 --> 07:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
that so just like we used example before
 
07:33:31.150 --> 07:33:31.160 align:start position:0%
if uh fors an S1 F-150 and that's using
 
07:33:32.750 --> 07:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
a crime they're not liable for that
 
07:33:34.670 --> 07:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
legal sale and they cannot be held
 
07:33:35.788 --> 07:33:35.798 align:start position:0%
responsible for anything that happens
 
07:33:37.510 --> 07:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
after that sale same with gun
 
07:33:39.548 --> 07:33:39.558 align:start position:0%
manufacturers right so this is not just
 
07:33:41.230 --> 07:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
purely for gun manufacturers this is a
 
07:33:43.750 --> 07:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
long-standing federal law um we've
 
07:33:47.110 --> 07:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
talked about uh about the impact on the
 
07:33:49.388 --> 07:33:49.398 align:start position:0%
economic impact in New Hampshire um this
 
07:33:52.150 --> 07:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
is passed it would be not prudent for a
 
07:33:54.070 --> 07:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
gun manufacturer gun retailer to operate
 
07:33:55.230 --> 07:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire where they
 
07:33:57.308 --> 07:33:57.318 align:start position:0%
could be sued out of business overnight
 
07:33:59.430 --> 07:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
because of a legally sold firearm so if
 
07:34:02.548 --> 07:34:02.558 align:start position:0%
Ruger sells uh their firearms to L Cody
 
07:34:03.750 --> 07:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
who then makes a legal sale through the
 
07:34:05.150 --> 07:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
Knicks background checks and then that
 
07:34:07.190 --> 07:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
person turns around and commits a crime
 
07:34:08.510 --> 07:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
or the way these bills are written
 
07:34:10.750 --> 07:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
typically if that is a legal sale and
 
07:34:12.270 --> 07:34:12.280 align:start position:0%
that firearm is stolen and then used in
 
07:34:14.270 --> 07:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
a crime well then Ruger would still be
 
07:34:16.030 --> 07:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
held responsible for that I think most
 
07:34:17.750 --> 07:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable people on this uh in New
 
07:34:18.670 --> 07:34:18.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would agree that that is
 
07:34:18.680 --> 07:34:19.990 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would agree that that is
unreason

07:34:19.990 --> 07:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
unreason
 
07:34:22.430 --> 07:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
um so for all those reasons St above and
 
07:34:23.628 --> 07:34:23.638 align:start position:0%
it seems like this committee has a very
 
07:34:24.910 --> 07:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
good understanding of why this is a bad
 
07:34:26.830 --> 07:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
idea for New Hampshire the NRA and our
 
07:34:28.230 --> 07:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
members oppose this bill and I'm happy
 
07:34:30.750 --> 07:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
to uh take any questions you may
 
07:34:33.548 --> 07:34:33.558 align:start position:0%
have question representative Smith um I
 
07:34:35.030 --> 07:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
just have a technical question are you
 
07:34:36.750 --> 07:34:36.760 align:start position:0%

07:34:39.830 --> 07:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I am yes do you have an
 
07:34:42.230 --> 07:34:42.240 align:start position:0%

I apologize so I have my other state one
 
07:34:50.110 --> 07:34:50.120 align:start position:0%
but I understand that that is necessary
 
07:34:52.510 --> 07:34:52.520 align:start position:0%

07:34:54.670 --> 07:34:54.680 align:start position:0%
fairness I wanted to make sure yep 100%

07:35:03.190 --> 07:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
testified before you may return I I want
 
07:35:11.230 --> 07:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:13.910 --> 07:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
07:35:15.230 --> 07:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and thank you
 
07:35:17.990 --> 07:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
for your Indulgence I will be
 
07:35:21.708 --> 07:35:21.718 align:start position:0%
brief the fellow who shot those two
 
07:35:24.830 --> 07:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
police officers and I have read the New
 
07:35:26.948 --> 07:35:26.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court opinion
 
07:35:29.590 --> 07:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
carefully there was nothing in the
 
07:35:33.868 --> 07:35:33.878 align:start position:0%
records that disqualified him yes he had
 
07:35:35.628 --> 07:35:35.638 align:start position:0%
mental health issues but he had never
 
07:35:35.638 --> 07:35:36.468 align:start position:0%
mental health issues but he had never
been

07:35:36.468 --> 07:35:36.478 align:start position:0%
been
 
07:35:38.830 --> 07:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
adjudicated that term has a very
 
07:35:40.430 --> 07:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
specific meaning in the
 
07:35:40.440 --> 07:35:42.190 align:start position:0%
specific meaning in the
law

07:35:42.190 --> 07:35:42.200 align:start position:0%
law
 
07:35:44.830 --> 07:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
and the department of
 
07:35:47.788 --> 07:35:47.798 align:start position:0%
safety did its homework and they
 
07:35:49.590 --> 07:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
determined he was not
 
07:35:53.750 --> 07:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
prohibited secondly a statement was made
 
07:35:56.590 --> 07:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
repeatedly that
 
07:35:56.600 --> 07:35:59.510 align:start position:0%
repeatedly that
the

07:35:59.510 --> 07:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:36:02.788 --> 07:36:02.798 align:start position:0%
statute at issue here prevented those
 
07:36:05.468 --> 07:36:05.478 align:start position:0%
officers from bringing their case it did
 
07:36:08.270 --> 07:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
not they brought their case it went all
 
07:36:10.308 --> 07:36:10.318 align:start position:0%
the way to the New Hampshire Supreme
 
07:36:14.350 --> 07:36:14.360 align:start position:0%
Court the court found that there was no
 
07:36:17.030 --> 07:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
liability because the buyer was not
 
07:36:21.548 --> 07:36:21.558 align:start position:0%
prohibited and the Dealer did nothing
 
07:36:25.308 --> 07:36:25.318 align:start position:0%
wrong it's that simple again folks need
 
07:36:27.670 --> 07:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
to do homework get their facts
 
07:36:31.868 --> 07:36:31.878 align:start position:0%
straight one final point and then I go
 
07:36:33.510 --> 07:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
and it is
 
07:36:37.230 --> 07:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
this globally the downside to gun
 
07:36:39.110 --> 07:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
control is
 
07:36:42.190 --> 07:36:42.200 align:start position:0%
genocide it is impossible to murder
 
07:36:45.230 --> 07:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands or Millions unless
 
07:36:47.948 --> 07:36:47.958 align:start position:0%
and until the targeted group and their
 
07:36:50.948 --> 07:36:50.958 align:start position:0%
sympathizers have been disarmed in my
 
07:36:53.510 --> 07:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
written testimony I cite the example of
 
07:36:56.270 --> 07:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
the Soviet Union if any of you want to
 
07:36:59.750 --> 07:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
see the authentic text of Soviet gun
 
07:37:04.030 --> 07:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
control initiated on 1 April 1918 I will
 
07:37:06.590 --> 07:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
provide it to you with a
 
07:37:09.030 --> 07:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
translation and the translation's
 
07:37:12.868 --> 07:37:12.878 align:start position:0%
accurate all right thank you Mr chairman
 
07:37:14.308 --> 07:37:14.318 align:start position:0%
members of the committee again if there
 
07:37:15.230 --> 07:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
are any
 
07:37:18.830 --> 07:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
questions uh my email address is at the
 
07:37:20.110 --> 07:37:20.120 align:start position:0%
bottom of my
 
07:37:23.388 --> 07:37:23.398 align:start position:0%
testimony please feel free to contact
 
07:37:28.030 --> 07:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
me thank you thank
 
07:37:31.708 --> 07:37:31.718 align:start position:0%
you all right anyone else who
 
07:37:34.948 --> 07:37:34.958 align:start position:0%
wishes no I don't want to if you have a
 
07:37:36.670 --> 07:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
if you
 
07:37:36.680 --> 07:37:41.830 align:start position:0%
if you
have

07:37:41.830 --> 07:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:44.788 --> 07:37:44.798 align:start position:0%
okay double-checking this as we speak
 
07:37:46.468 --> 07:37:46.478 align:start position:0%
but I would just encourage the committee
 
07:37:48.510 --> 07:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
to take a a closer look at that court
 
07:37:48.520 --> 07:37:49.350 align:start position:0%
to take a a closer look at that court
case

07:37:49.350 --> 07:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
case
 
07:37:51.590 --> 07:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
I believe if memory serves me right that
 
07:37:53.910 --> 07:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
the um authorization to sell that
 
07:37:56.030 --> 07:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
firearm to that individual had not gone
 
07:37:57.948 --> 07:37:57.958 align:start position:0%
through yet there's actually a loophole
 
07:38:00.388 --> 07:38:00.398 align:start position:0%
in state and federal law that after 3
 
07:38:03.150 --> 07:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
days you can you can proceed with a sale
 
07:38:05.468 --> 07:38:05.478 align:start position:0%
if there has not been if um there has
 
07:38:07.270 --> 07:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
not been a holder Den I think I think
 
07:38:08.990 --> 07:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
you're right but but I mean the bottom
 
07:38:11.350 --> 07:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
line of that is that was a lawful sale
 
07:38:15.350 --> 07:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
because but the point is about immunity
 
07:38:19.270 --> 07:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
so the the gun store knew knew that
 
07:38:21.230 --> 07:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
there were concerns they had been
 
07:38:23.628 --> 07:38:23.638 align:start position:0%
flagged that there were concerns there
 
07:38:26.110 --> 07:38:26.120 align:start position:0%
the public safety for everyone was at
 
07:38:29.388 --> 07:38:29.398 align:start position:0%
risk should that sale proceed now if we
 
07:38:33.190 --> 07:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
have a if we have immunity there is no
 
07:38:35.788 --> 07:38:35.798 align:start position:0%
skin in the game there is no stake to to
 
07:38:37.990 --> 07:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
require that those who are in this
 
07:38:40.990 --> 07:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
industry take proactive steps to help
 
07:38:42.670 --> 07:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
either ensure those policies are in
 
07:38:43.948 --> 07:38:43.958 align:start position:0%
place or to
 
07:38:45.948 --> 07:38:45.958 align:start position:0%
independently um through a voluntary
 
07:38:49.670 --> 07:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
process uphold Public Safety processes
 
07:38:51.708 --> 07:38:51.718 align:start position:0%
that will keep our community safe and
 
07:38:53.670 --> 07:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
that is what this type of Bill is about
 
07:38:55.150 --> 07:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
so I just want to be thoughtful let me
 
07:38:57.230 --> 07:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that that you rais a very very
 
07:38:59.308 --> 07:38:59.318 align:start position:0%
interesting point so what you're saying
 
07:39:03.388 --> 07:39:03.398 align:start position:0%
is that despite the law the statutory
 
07:39:06.830 --> 07:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
law saying that if you don't if unless
 
07:39:08.788 --> 07:39:08.798 align:start position:0%
they unless they tell you you're
 
07:39:11.948 --> 07:39:11.958 align:start position:0%
prohibited within three days it's lawful
 
07:39:15.070 --> 07:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
for the man for the dealer to transfer
 
07:39:18.388 --> 07:39:18.398 align:start position:0%
the gun what you're saying is if we if
 
07:39:21.350 --> 07:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
we we pass this law saying that the
 
07:39:24.468 --> 07:39:24.478 align:start position:0%
immunity is relieved then some clever
 
07:39:26.308 --> 07:39:26.318 align:start position:0%
lawyer may come in and and try to
 
07:39:29.350 --> 07:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
persuade a jury that despite what the
 
07:39:33.788 --> 07:39:33.798 align:start position:0%
statute said the the the gun U dealer
 
07:39:36.590 --> 07:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
acted quote unquote unreasonably by
 
07:39:39.350 --> 07:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
selling the gun that's what you're would
 
07:39:40.788 --> 07:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
you what you would like to see I think
 
07:39:42.868 --> 07:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
the I think the question before you is
 
07:39:44.670 --> 07:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
are you going to pass public policies
 
07:39:46.830 --> 07:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
that ensure the safety of our community
 
07:39:49.388 --> 07:39:49.398 align:start position:0%
or are you going to encourage volunteer
 
07:39:51.708 --> 07:39:51.718 align:start position:0%
actions by the gun industry neither of
 
07:39:52.910 --> 07:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
which it seems this committee is
 
07:39:55.628 --> 07:39:55.638 align:start position:0%
prepared to do thank you representative
 
07:39:57.548 --> 07:39:57.558 align:start position:0%
Wallace thank you thank you for taking
 
07:39:59.308 --> 07:39:59.318 align:start position:0%
my question in the case you just brought
 
07:40:01.110 --> 07:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
back to our attention were any charges
 
07:40:03.708 --> 07:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
filed against the uh the Firearms dealer
 
07:40:05.350 --> 07:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
in this particular case I believe I
 
07:40:06.868 --> 07:40:06.878 align:start position:0%
believe they were one of the I believe
 
07:40:09.230 --> 07:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
it was the excuse me Department of
 
07:40:11.830 --> 07:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
Safety and the gun store but again I'm
 
07:40:13.150 --> 07:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
just refreshing it real quick in
 
07:40:14.948 --> 07:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
response to this I don't recall any
 
07:40:16.708 --> 07:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
charges being filed against that gun
 
07:40:18.110 --> 07:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
dealer because everything they did was
 
07:40:18.120 --> 07:40:19.510 align:start position:0%
dealer because everything they did was
lawful

07:40:19.510 --> 07:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
lawful
 
07:40:22.910 --> 07:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
for Chester Chester arms that's correct
 
07:40:25.510 --> 07:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
um well he was cleared and they were
 
07:40:26.830 --> 07:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
open for
 
07:40:29.070 --> 07:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
business yeah I will double check that
 
07:40:30.388 --> 07:40:30.398 align:start position:0%
but I believe that at one point that
 
07:40:32.510 --> 07:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
they were included in the lawsuit
 
07:40:34.150 --> 07:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
proceeds thank you thank you very much
