lightly at all

to understand
 
00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:44.940 align:start position:0%
what you should expect as elected
 
00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
officials from a true Christian
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
or someone that says they are minister
 
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
of the Gospel
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
what you shouldn't expect is him to
 
00:44:59.089 --> 00:44:59.099 align:start position:0%
rally against you as our elected
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%

00:45:10.849 --> 00:45:10.859 align:start position:0%
impose signs about you that's not what a
 
00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
Christian in the minister of the Gospel
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
is not to do
 
00:45:17.809 --> 00:45:17.819 align:start position:0%
but here Paul
 
00:45:20.569 --> 00:45:20.579 align:start position:0%
made very clear instructions to his
 
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
young he called child in the faith this
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
pastor Timothy
 
00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:27.420 align:start position:0%
and before I pray here's where I want
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
you to understand what I am praying
 
00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
Paul says here first of all then
 
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:36.079 align:start position:0%
I urge that in treaties and prayers
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
petitions and Thanksgiving
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
be made on behalf of all men
 
00:45:47.809 --> 00:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
now in the Hebrew in Greek all means all
 
00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
for kings and all who are in Authority
 
00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet
 
00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:57.109 align:start position:0%
so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet
life

00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
life
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
this is good and acceptable in the sight
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
of God our savior who desires all men to
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
be saved and to come to the knowledge of
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
the truth
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
for there is one God and one mediator
 
00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
also between God and Men the man Christ
 
00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:19.609 align:start position:0%

my fourth inaugural address and an
 
01:00:33.049 --> 01:00:33.059 align:start position:0%
interesting fun fact I was told this
 
01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:35.700 align:start position:0%
this morning it is the first time in
 
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
American history a little Civics fun
 
01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
fact for you that a four-term governor
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
is being sworn in by a fourth Supreme
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
Court Justice
 
01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:47.700 align:start position:0%

McDonald
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
um which is even more amazing
 
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
considering we get elected every two
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
years but we've had four justices so
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
there's your fun Civics fact for the day
 
01:00:59.809 --> 01:00:59.819 align:start position:0%
it really does continue to be the honor
 
01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
of a lifetime to serve as the governor
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
of the Granite State it's a great state
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
and I think of standing here uh just six
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
short years ago
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
it really seems like a lifetime right I
 
01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:12.180 align:start position:0%
mean given what we've all gone through
 
01:01:14.089 --> 01:01:14.099 align:start position:0%
given the amazing things and the
 
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
accomplishments that we've been able to
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
achieve both within the legislative body
 
01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:19.740 align:start position:0%
working within the executive branch but
 
01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
we always have to appreciate that our
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
work really isn't done families and
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
small business businesses are truly
 
01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
counting on us to keep delivering
 
01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:28.670 align:start position:0%
counting on us to keep delivering
results

01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
results
 
01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
over the last six years New Hampshire
 
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
really has become an island of Freedom
 
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
surrounded by frankly highly taxed and
 
01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
highly regulated States we're a harbor
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
for Citizens that are fleeing or leaving
 
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
their home state to in really pursuit of
 
01:01:45.049 --> 01:01:45.059 align:start position:0%
that Live Free or Die way of life
 
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
we continue to open up doors of
 
01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:48.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity giving families the freedom
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
to choose their path that best suits
 
01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
their needs
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
we've provided leadership that pivots
 
01:01:57.530 --> 01:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
the individual ahead of the system
 
01:01:58.910 --> 01:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
sounds obvious to us here in New
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but it's actually quite unique
 
01:02:03.049 --> 01:02:03.059 align:start position:0%
it ensures that everyone regardless of
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
race or gender or income religion
 
01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be everyone has the
 
01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
same opportunities to succeed
 
01:02:11.809 --> 01:02:11.819 align:start position:0%
when other states were slow rolling the
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine just the vaccine distribution we
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
went fast we gave everyone that freedom
 
01:02:17.329 --> 01:02:17.339 align:start position:0%
to choose when other states shut down
 
01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
schools we open them up when other
 
01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:21.180 align:start position:0%
states close down their businesses we
 
01:02:23.329 --> 01:02:23.339 align:start position:0%
kept the lights on and we invested in
 
01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
their success when other states use the
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
pandemic as an excuse to raise taxes or
 
01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:29.220 align:start position:0%
permanently alter government
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
government's influence it was New
 
01:02:32.809 --> 01:02:32.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that cut taxes it was New
 
01:02:34.609 --> 01:02:34.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that said no to mandates and
 
01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
it was New Hampshire that became the
 
01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:43.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:45.309 align:start position:0%

01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
politics out the window at the time
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of political Rancor across
 
01:02:50.329 --> 01:02:50.339 align:start position:0%
this country but we in New Hampshire
 
01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
through those politics out the window we
 
01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
followed data we chartered a new course
 
01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
and as a result not only is our our
 
01:02:58.849 --> 01:02:58.859 align:start position:0%
economy the strongest in the region but
 
01:03:00.289 --> 01:03:00.299 align:start position:0%
we were ranked as one of the safest
 
01:03:02.809 --> 01:03:02.819 align:start position:0%
states in the country during the covet
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%

01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
wonderful they are nice and all but they
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
do not tell the full story right that
 
01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
story of the New Hampshire Advantage
 
01:04:11.329 --> 01:04:11.339 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
01:04:13.069 --> 01:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
and I I admit I'll be the first one to
 
01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
tell you it ain't a fair fight right
 
01:04:15.289 --> 01:04:15.299 align:start position:0%
when you're comparing New Hampshire to
 
01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
49 other states it's not a fair fight
 
01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
they get jealous my phone will start
 
01:04:20.809 --> 01:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
ringing from other Governors I get it
 
01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:22.619 align:start position:0%
um but we do have something to be very
 
01:04:24.049 --> 01:04:24.059 align:start position:0%
proud of and it didn't come by accident
 
01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
it came with hard work all the way down
 
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
from the governor to the 1.4 million of
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
the citizens that create that
 
01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity we are to live for your die
 
01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
State and we don't need those rankings
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
to just validate our success story for
 
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
over 200 years every other state has
 
01:04:41.569 --> 01:04:41.579 align:start position:0%
effectively been playing catch-up so
 
01:04:42.770 --> 01:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
instead of the rankings let's look at
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
some of the real facts together over the
 
01:04:47.089 --> 01:04:47.099 align:start position:0%
past six years we've crafted three
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
balanced budgets with no new taxes and
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it again
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:58.490 --> 01:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
we delivered full day kindergarten we
 
01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
delivered a historic school choice bill
 
01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:04.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
and we did this all while spending more
 
01:05:09.289 --> 01:05:09.299 align:start position:0%
money on public school students than
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
we built a whole new treatment and
 
01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
recovery system and it's getting results
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
and when 48 other states unfortunately
 
01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
we saw what was happening nationally we
 
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
saw their overdose deaths they were
 
01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
skyrocketing during the pandemic but New
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire bucked that National Trend
 
01:05:30.049 --> 01:05:30.059 align:start position:0%
showing that our doorway system truly
 
01:05:30.059 --> 01:05:31.010 align:start position:0%
showing that our doorway system truly
worked

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
worked
 
01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
and after years of talk we finally
 
01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
delivered a paid family medical leave
 
01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
that's voluntary that's affordable and
 
01:05:39.850 --> 01:05:39.860 align:start position:0%
that does not include an income tax
 
01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:44.329 align:start position:0%
that does not include an income tax
[Applause]

01:05:44.329 --> 01:05:44.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
we made historic investments into new
 
01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
housing we capitalized on new ideas like
 
01:05:51.289 --> 01:05:51.299 align:start position:0%
the One-Stop veterans campus in Franklin
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
to support our nation's Heroes it's the
 
01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:02.809 --> 01:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
and over the last six years we
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
downshifted cash not costs to our cities
 
01:06:08.569 --> 01:06:08.579 align:start position:0%
and towns returning hundreds of millions
 
01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
of dollars and tax relief for our
 
01:06:12.530 --> 01:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
citizens and in fact since I became
 
01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
Governor 82 percent of the cities and
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
towns in the state have seen their
 
01:06:21.650 --> 01:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
now none of it's an accident it's the
 
01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
result of smart management responsible
 
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
decision making and simply putting
 
01:06:30.349 --> 01:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
individuals simply putting people first
 
01:06:32.569 --> 01:06:32.579 align:start position:0%
so it was unbelievably good is this past
 
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
six years have been and despite our
 
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
record of success we do have tough
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
challenges ahead and the most pressing
 
01:06:39.410 --> 01:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
one that affects every family and
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
business across the state is this
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
looming energy crisis
 
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
Summers without air conditioning in New
 
01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:46.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they can be tough but Winters
 
01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
without heat in New Hampshire they can
 
01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
be deadly
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
when it comes to solutions to the energy
 
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
crisis we must have the courage to take
 
01:06:56.329 --> 01:06:56.339 align:start position:0%
politics out of the equation and
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
together together last fall was an
 
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
amazing opportunity we passed the most
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
comprehensive energy relief package the
 
01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
state had ever seen Republicans and
 
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
Democrats came together to make a real
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
impact for families struggling with high
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
electric bills making available 35
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
million dollars in electricity and
 
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
heating credits for more New Hampshire
 
01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
families increasing and also increasing
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
investments into our existing
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
thank you guys
 
01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:29.150 align:start position:0%
thank you guys
[Applause]

01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
and with everything comes balance which
 
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
is why in addition to these new
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
Investments we continue to explore
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
longer term options longer term options
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
such as offshore wind or more hydropower
 
01:07:41.329 --> 01:07:41.339 align:start position:0%
out of Canada expanding renewable solar
 
01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
projects especially for lower income
 
01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
families and municipalities but there's
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
more that needs to be done and our Focus
 
01:07:50.089 --> 01:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
must remain on reducing that cost burden
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
on citizens rather than adding to it
 
01:07:54.349 --> 01:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
electric grade payers are already
 
01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%
getting crushed by this National energy
 
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
crisis we see it every day therefore we
 
01:07:59.870 --> 01:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
have to reject that legislation that
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
will impose additional unnecessary costs
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
I vetoed legislation that would have
 
01:08:06.289 --> 01:08:06.299 align:start position:0%
imposed millions in new costs on
 
01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
citizens in the time of Crisis and
 
01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
frankly I was very excited to be the
 
01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
first to stand up and stop that crazy 17
 
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
Cent Regional gas tax increase that
 
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts wanted to throw down on us
 
01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
my veto pen has plenty of ink and will
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
always be ready for to protect our
 
01:08:25.099 --> 01:08:25.109 align:start position:0%
citizens from that kind of nonsense
 
01:08:25.109 --> 01:08:26.809 align:start position:0%
citizens from that kind of nonsense
[Applause]

01:08:26.809 --> 01:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
when it comes to energy policy we can't
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
just follow States like Massachusetts
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
and New York and California just the
 
01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
opposite we have to continue to protect
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
our interests from the policies of other
 
01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
states and ensure that we have the
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
resources needed to make our voice heard
 
01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
it's critical that we come together and
 
01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
get this done everyone from Seniors to
 
01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:47.699 align:start position:0%
those on fixed incomes young families
 
01:08:50.150 --> 01:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
they're all counting on us to get this
 
01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.289 align:start position:0%
they're all counting on us to get this
right

01:08:51.289 --> 01:08:51.299 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:08:53.570 --> 01:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
now I'm going to change gears just a
 
01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh the last time I stood up here in
 
01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
Representatives Hall addressing you I
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
started by thanking then Secretary of
 
01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
State Bill Gardner uh and at the time it
 
01:09:04.970 --> 01:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
was then Deputy deputy secretary of
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
state Dave Scanlon where's Dave
 
01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
hey Mr secretary how are you today
 
01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
at that time we wanted to take the
 
01:09:14.749 --> 01:09:14.759 align:start position:0%
opportunity we had just come off of the
 
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
2020 election and we took the
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to thank the countless poll
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
workers the town moderators the all
 
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
those Town officials across the state on
 
01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
a job well done on a successful and
 
01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:27.299 align:start position:0%
seamless 2020 first in the nation
 
01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
presidential primary we all remember
 
01:09:32.809 --> 01:09:32.819 align:start position:0%
quite well after the 2020 debacle in
 
01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:38.570 --> 01:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
sure Governor Reynolds will give me a
 
01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
call the nation really did if you
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
remember they turned their eyes towards
 
01:09:44.209 --> 01:09:44.219 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire right
 
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to follow us here the stakes
 
01:09:50.809 --> 01:09:50.819 align:start position:0%
were very high but it was nothing that
 
01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:53.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire could not handle and at a
 
01:09:55.850 --> 01:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
time of electoral uncertainty and doubt
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
in our elections New Hampshire we put on
 
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
a clinic for the rest of the nation in
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
terms of how to administer elections and
 
01:10:04.669 --> 01:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
America breathed a huge sigh of relief
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
as we we restored confidence to the
 
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
entire system
 
01:10:10.729 --> 01:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
and this is an issue that we across
 
01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:12.780 align:start position:0%
party lines truly stand in unison on
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
today the New Hampshire State Democrat
 
01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
Party the New Hampshire State Republican
 
01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
party the democrat-led federal
 
01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
delegation the Republican Governor the
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
house the Senate everyone across the
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
board is standing together pushing back
 
01:10:27.169 --> 01:10:27.179 align:start position:0%
on this attempt that we hear to erode
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
such an important process it's a strong
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
message of bipartisanship and frankly as
 
01:10:34.189 --> 01:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
strong as anyone you've ever seen here
 
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
in the state because we all know that
 
01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:38.219 align:start position:0%
recently you have the power Brokers and
 
01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
the Washington driven Democrat Party
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
they've made it clear that they believe
 
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's time is up when it comes
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
to the first in the nation primary
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
Washington Democrats are so misinformed
 
01:10:51.229 --> 01:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
they chose South Carolina to take our
 
01:10:54.169 --> 01:10:54.179 align:start position:0%
place in 2020 South Carolina their their
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
primary had a voter turnout of about 16
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
percent while New Hampshire was setting
 
01:11:02.689 --> 01:11:02.699 align:start position:0%
records in 2020 the last time an
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
incumbent president was on the ballot in
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
South Carolina they canceled their
 
01:11:08.649 --> 01:11:08.659 align:start position:0%
primary depriving voters of a choice
 
01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the power Brokers within
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
that state just chose who to war award
 
01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
their delegates to that's not the
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
Democracy it's incumbent protection and
 
01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
something that New Hampshire will never
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:28.930 align:start position:0%

01:11:28.930 --> 01:11:28.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:31.729 --> 01:11:31.739 align:start position:0%
message for President Biden you can come
 
01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
and try and take it but it is never
 
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
going to happen it is just not in our
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
DNA to give it up
 
01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
and you've heard it all out there we're
 
01:11:53.689 --> 01:11:53.699 align:start position:0%
not going to be blackmailed we're not
 
01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
going to be threatened and we will not
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
give up
 
01:11:59.630 --> 01:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire primary has stood the
 
01:12:02.689 --> 01:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
test of time it gives everyone a fair
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
shot no matter what your name ID no
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
matter how much money you have in your
 
01:12:08.209 --> 01:12:08.219 align:start position:0%
campaign account or the elected office
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
you held before running for president
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
for 100 years New Hampshire has given
 
01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
voice to lesser-known candidates and
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
provided a pathway to the presidency for
 
01:12:19.850 --> 01:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
anyone dedicated enough to test their
 
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
medal with the New Hampshire voters so
 
01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
mark my words
 
01:12:25.729 --> 01:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
come next year secretary of state state
 
01:12:27.649 --> 01:12:27.659 align:start position:0%
Scanlon will ensure that the New
 
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does Remain the first in the

01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
primary is something that everyone
 
01:12:54.169 --> 01:12:54.179 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire and across the
 
01:12:56.209 --> 01:12:56.219 align:start position:0%
aisle can agree on but we know there are
 
01:12:58.970 --> 01:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
other hot button issues where there are
 
01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
clear ideological differences between us
 
01:13:03.169 --> 01:13:03.179 align:start position:0%
of course we can have our disagreements
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
but it is incumbent upon all of us to
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
not let those disagreements get in the
 
01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
way of individual opportunity we
 
01:13:11.570 --> 01:13:11.580 align:start position:0%
negotiate we work together we give a
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
little to get a lot because that's the
 
01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
accountability that the New Hampshire
 
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
voters demand and frankly deserve of
 
01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
their public servants
 
01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:22.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire like America is not immune
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
to political extremism but we must do
 
01:13:26.689 --> 01:13:26.699 align:start position:0%
everything we can in our power to push
 
01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
back against it
 
01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
the voters this past November sent a
 
01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
very clear message they want leaders who
 
01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
can deliver
 
01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
you don't just kick the can down the
 
01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
road or blame the next person in line
 
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
you face challenges head on you invite
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
solution driven individuals to the table
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
to work the problem and what a lot of
 
01:13:45.290 --> 01:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
people don't appreciate is that's the
 
01:13:47.450 --> 01:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
fun part right the redesign and the
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
repurpose of our systems is really what
 
01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
keeps New Hampshire on top the voters of
 
01:13:54.169 --> 01:13:54.179 align:start position:0%
our great state elected a near evenly
 
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
divided legislature presenting an
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
awesome opportunity for this type of
 
01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.229 align:start position:0%
awesome opportunity for this type of
cooperation

01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
cooperation
 
01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:03.730 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:14.290 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:14:14.290 --> 01:14:14.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:19.010 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

01:14:19.010 --> 01:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:21.900 align:start position:0%
but what a great lesson what a great
 
01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
civics lesson and challenge that we do
 
01:14:26.209 --> 01:14:26.219 align:start position:0%
find ourselves in
 
01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
the last time the New Hampshire
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
legislature was this narrowly divided
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
was 1871 and um as a side note I think
 
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
the Josiah Bartlett Center did a really
 
01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:40.140 align:start position:0%
amazing piece on what happened in 1871.
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
if you think the political Rancor of
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
today is bad you should read that
 
01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
article it is absolutely crazy it makes
 
01:14:46.729 --> 01:14:46.739 align:start position:0%
what's going on today like look like a
 
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
softball game it was really crazy what
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.930 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:14:53.930 --> 01:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:14:56.570 --> 01:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
01:14:58.970 --> 01:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
that we don't let some of those antics
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
of ancient history infiltrate the
 
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
opportunities that we have today we know
 
01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
that we can lead by example and show
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
that a well-designed system can produce
 
01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
results regardless of where the national
 
01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:13.140 align:start position:0%
rhetoric might be constituent service is
 
01:15:15.050 --> 01:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
more important than going viral on
 
01:15:17.209 --> 01:15:17.219 align:start position:0%
Twitter it's been a it's been great to
 
01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
already see this legislature's eagerness
 
01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
and willingness to put partisanship
 
01:15:23.149 --> 01:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
aside and work together
 
01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
now this year let's commit to find
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
compromise where we can disagree
 
01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
amicably where we where we must and
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
always remember
 
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
state are just counting on us to deliver
 
01:15:35.570 --> 01:15:35.580 align:start position:0%
the voters of New Hampshire do not
 
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
reward those who yell the loudest but
 
01:15:39.290 --> 01:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
they reward those who work hard they
 
01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
roll up their sleeves and they get the
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
job done
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
with such a narrowly divided legislature
 
01:15:45.649 --> 01:15:45.659 align:start position:0%
we have an incredible opportunity to set
 
01:15:48.649 --> 01:15:48.659 align:start position:0%
an example for the rest of the nation
 
01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
so why exactly is it that we are so good
 
01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
at what we do
 
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
well the main reason is is that it
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
starts with a robust Civics dialogue
 
01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
it's New Hampshire and every Granite
 
01:16:04.010 --> 01:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
seder knows somebody who has served in
 
01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
elective office whether it be a family
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
member a friend a neighbor maybe it's
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
the planning board or the school board
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
Governor whatever it might be we take
 
01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
pride in our accessibility and our
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
connectedness to our constituents when
 
01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
you run into your Selectmen at Dunkin
 
01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
Donuts or Market Basket you let them
 
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
know what's on your mind
 
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
Lord knows I have done some of my most
 
01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:24.900 align:start position:0%
important listening in the serial aisle
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
of Market Basket in Epping
 
01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
it's usually because the serial aisle is
 
01:16:32.090 --> 01:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
so big and I'm staring aimlessly at the
 
01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
thing trying to figure out what what my
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
kids want to eat but it is a great
 
01:16:36.890 --> 01:16:36.900 align:start position:0%
opportunity and we all as public
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
servants as elected officials have to
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
find those moments those opportunities
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
to be great listeners because that's the
 
01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.130 align:start position:0%
to be great listeners because that's the
expectation

01:16:46.130 --> 01:16:46.140 align:start position:0%
expectation
 
01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
and it's because of our robust Civics
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
that we continue to lead the way in
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
engagement and personal responsibility
 
01:16:54.169 --> 01:16:54.179 align:start position:0%
and individual liberty now I mentioned I
 
01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
mentioned Mrs lankau's Civics and
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
government class who's joining us today
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
so our job is really to deliver results
 
01:17:02.810 --> 01:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
we know that but just as important we
 
01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
must set an example for those students
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
that are sitting up in that Gallery we
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
must Inspire them keep them involved
 
01:17:10.729 --> 01:17:10.739 align:start position:0%
instill the principles that make New
 
01:17:12.669 --> 01:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire putting
 
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
individuals ahead of big systems
 
01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:17.940 align:start position:0%
the average citizen is interested in
 
01:17:20.209 --> 01:17:20.219 align:start position:0%
seeing progress on their genuine issue
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
so this connection between elected
 
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
officials and citizens that's really the
 
01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
key to success that you really don't
 
01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
find in most any other state in the
 
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
country our entire system is based on
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
the idea of interconnectedness and
 
01:17:32.159 --> 01:17:34.010 align:start position:0%
the idea of interconnectedness and
interdependency

01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
interdependency
 
01:17:36.050 --> 01:17:36.060 align:start position:0%
and as an engineer I can tell you I
 
01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
think it's the ideal way to design a
 
01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
self-regulating system it's Unique in
 
01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
government it works and we should be
 
01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
very proud of that but make no mistake
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
while we stand on the shoulders of 200
 
01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
years of a disciplined process we're
 
01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
always just one generation away of
 
01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
becoming like everybody else and
 
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
nationally you've heard a lot of talk
 
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
over the past couple years this was an
 
01:17:58.850 --> 01:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
interesting story The the two words that
 
01:18:00.169 --> 01:18:00.179 align:start position:0%
we heard a lot on the news parents
 
01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
matter right
 
01:18:04.669 --> 01:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
so while those two simple words seem to
 
01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
be almost like a New Concept in a place
 
01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
like Virginia they've been a central
 
01:18:11.209 --> 01:18:11.219 align:start position:0%
concept to our communities in our
 
01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
government here in New Hampshire since
 
01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
the very beginning it's not big
 
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
government's job to impose its will upon
 
01:18:18.530 --> 01:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
cities and towns dictating this and
 
01:18:20.209 --> 01:18:20.219 align:start position:0%
mandating that and saying You must or
 
01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
you cannot big government
 
01:18:24.169 --> 01:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
authoritarianism might be the way they
 
01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
do it in 49 other states but it is not
 
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
how we do it here in New Hampshire it's
 
01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:33.430 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:35.090 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:18:37.490 --> 01:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
it's a very simple formula in New
 
01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we distilled decision making
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
down to the lowest possible levels of
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
power empowering individuals to make
 
01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
their voices heard at the local level
 
01:18:48.050 --> 01:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
where their voice is the greatest
 
01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire we call it local
 
01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
control we've been doing it for hundreds
 
01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
of years but we're not about to stop now
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is not up to
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
politicians in Concord to dictate how a
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
one-room schoolhouse a hundred miles
 
01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
away does things or manages themselves
 
01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
day to day the power lies with the
 
01:19:06.169 --> 01:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
parents and with the teachers and with
 
01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
the Partnerships at that local level
 
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
who send their kids to school and manage
 
01:19:13.130 --> 01:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
those those School rooms day to day our
 
01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
job is to set up
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
provide guidelines and more often than
 
01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:16.669 align:start position:0%
provide guidelines and more often than
not

01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:19:18.530 --> 01:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
frankly get out of the way
 
01:19:21.649 --> 01:19:21.659 align:start position:0%
you do you Live Free or Die it's more
 
01:19:23.689 --> 01:19:23.699 align:start position:0%
than just four words on a license plate
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
it's our way of life here in New
 
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we must remain committed
 
01:19:33.210 --> 01:19:33.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:36.350 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
too often across this country you have
 
01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
politicians at every level of power that
 
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
think that they know better than the
 
01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:43.430 align:start position:0%
think that they know better than the
individual

01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
they get their priorities messed up they
 
01:19:47.810 --> 01:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
lose sight of why they were elected they
 
01:19:50.209 --> 01:19:50.219 align:start position:0%
easily forget about the basic tenets of
 
01:19:52.189 --> 01:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
individual responsibility limited
 
01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
government fiscal responsibility and
 
01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
make no mistake when it comes to
 
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
government there is no greater
 
01:19:59.450 --> 01:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
responsibility than managing other
 
01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
people's money it's not our money it's
 
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
their money families across the state
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
have sweat out their paychecks they work
 
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
hard to earn a living and it's our job
 
01:20:10.729 --> 01:20:10.739 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're being efficient
 
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
and responsible with that trust
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately too many politicians
 
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
don't consider those fiscal issues they
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
don't consider the importance of
 
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
balancing budgets
 
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
from their positions of power at State
 
01:20:25.010 --> 01:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
houses all across this country to the
 
01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
halls of Congress and Washington too
 
01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
many of them think they know better than
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
those that voted them into office and as
 
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
a result you have big government
 
01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
politicians losing sight of why we were
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
elected what public service is all about
 
01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
and who exactly we need to be held
 
01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
accountable to
 
01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
it's not right to tell a private
 
01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
business what they can or cannot do it
 
01:20:45.649 --> 01:20:45.659 align:start position:0%
is not the New Hampshire way to force
 
01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
locally elected and accountable school
 
01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
districts or town councils to bend to
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
the state House's will that's not
 
01:20:53.570 --> 01:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
leadership it's not conservative and it
 
01:20:57.050 --> 01:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.220 --> 01:20:58.230 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:58.230 --> 01:21:00.410 align:start position:0%
thank you
[Applause]

01:21:00.410 --> 01:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
I call it I call it taking the easy way
 
01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
out but leadership is about knowing the
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
limitations of your own power getting
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
government out of the way empowering
 
01:21:11.330 --> 01:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
those individuals and families to make
 
01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
the best decisions for themselves this
 
01:21:16.729 --> 01:21:16.739 align:start position:0%
is America we are a free country and we
 
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
believe in the Constitution and the
 
01:21:20.570 --> 01:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
Constitution gives every American
 
01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
gives every American the right to make
 
01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
stupid decisions sometimes right
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
I guess that's the beauty of being in
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
such a free country and just because I
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
may not like something or agree with
 
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
what you might have said doesn't mean it
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed I sure as heck don't
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
like what every business might do I I
 
01:21:38.270 --> 01:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
might not like whatever May whatever
 
01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
mayor does or whatever school or School
 
01:21:41.090 --> 01:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
District does
 
01:21:42.649 --> 01:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
but they're accountable to their own
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
voters they're accountable to their
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
local constituents and at last I checked
 
01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
people don't need politicians or
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
corporate boardrooms telling them what
 
01:21:52.610 --> 01:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
is right and what is wrong New Hampshire
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
will not be lectured or beholden to
 
01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
out-of-touch politicians who are
 
01:21:57.050 --> 01:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
disconnected from realities on the
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
ground that those those issues that are
 
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
really facing those businesses and
 
01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
families today will not be lectured by
 
01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
out-of-state businesses forcing their
 
01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
Politics on consumers will not be
 
01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
lectured by the power Brokers in
 
01:22:10.610 --> 01:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
Washington D.C this is New Hampshire and
 
01:22:12.590 --> 01:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
when we do it our way we do it better
 
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
than anyone
 
01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
than anyone
then

01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:16.750 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:16.750 --> 01:22:20.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire model works it's
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
proven and it's why other states are
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
taking notes this job is much bigger so
 
01:22:30.410 --> 01:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
much bigger than any of ourselves and we
 
01:22:31.850 --> 01:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
have to remind ourselves of that every
 
01:22:34.130 --> 01:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
single day
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
it's time we take that ego frankly a
 
01:22:38.630 --> 01:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
little bit of the hypocrisy out of
 
01:22:40.850 --> 01:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
politics it's time we get out of those
 
01:22:42.770 --> 01:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
Echo Chambers it's nice to be in that
 
01:22:44.689 --> 01:22:44.699 align:start position:0%
Echo chamber sometime people tell you
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
exactly what you want to hear but it's
 
01:22:48.290 --> 01:22:48.300 align:start position:0%
not real
 
01:22:50.330 --> 01:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
we have to get back into that real world
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
we have to hear how our decisions are
