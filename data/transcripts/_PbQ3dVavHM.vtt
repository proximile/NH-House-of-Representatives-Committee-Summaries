morning

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 align:start position:0%
we have uh four bills to discuss this
 
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
morning we have amendments to all of
 
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
those um I'd like to start with 8B
 
00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.509 align:start position:0%
 
subcommittee

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
did you want to what did you want to
 
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 align:start position:0%
introduce this one it's you worked on it
 
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
so yes I was filling in
 
00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
on the subcommittee on this one and what
 
00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 align:start position:0%
the amendment does is instead of adding
 
00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.350 align:start position:0%
the amendment does is instead of adding
a

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
specific organization to the list of
 
00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 align:start position:0%
ones that don't need that ones that can
 
00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.670 align:start position:0%
ones that don't need that ones that can
have

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.589 align:start position:0%
have
unlicensed

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
unlicensed
 
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
practitioners or conditional
 
00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:36.439 align:start position:0%
practitioners for that
 
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
matter and simply
 
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 align:start position:0%
described the type of organization that
 
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
that app that qualifies so it's a
 
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
organization that provides clinical
 
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Services employs licensed
 
00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
practitioners provides clinical
 
00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
supervision and assumes
 
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility so we don't care if it's
 
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
for profit or not for profit that's
 
00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 align:start position:0%
that's really irrelevant to the type of
 
00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 align:start position:0%
organization that to the type of
 
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
business but if they've got a structure
 
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 align:start position:0%
of mental health
 
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
um services including some licensed
 
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
practitioners who can be the supervisors
 
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
then they're allowed to hire
 
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
um new graduates unlicensed people or
 
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
people with
 
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
um conditional
 
00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 align:start position:0%
licenses and and supervise them and it's
 
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
the it gives them the umbrella of the
 
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
supervis and I think I thought the
 
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee thought that was the
 
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
simplest way to address the
 
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
issue guys any
 
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
comments yeah I I would agree that I
 
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
think it's the easiest way to handle the
 
00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 align:start position:0%
situation and I think from my personal
 
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
perspective I think it just does what
 
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
the statute arguably already did um but
 
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
there was some confusion around it I
 
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 align:start position:0%
think the language is much more clear
 
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 align:start position:0%
and uh will hopefully help to solve any
 
00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 align:start position:0%
any confusion yeah the
 
00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 align:start position:0%
apparently a for-profit clinic was being
 
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
treated differently than a non
 
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
for-profit Clinic while doing the same
 
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
type of work and nobody thought that was
 
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
an appropriate situation
 
00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
y um so if there's no further discussion
 
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
from the subcommittee I would entertain
 
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
a motion if anybody has one on
 
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.710 align:start position:0%
a motion if anybody has one on
amendments

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
BR all right so the motion is ought to
 
00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 align:start position:0%
pass on Amendment
 
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
R okay so um we'll recommend to the full
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
committee the adoption and then um I
 
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
will also move a to pass with Amendment
 
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
um any discussion on that or sorry
 
00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 align:start position:0%
second first do I have a second thanks
 
00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.469 align:start position:0%
second first do I have a second thanks
Steve

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
Steve
 
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
um all right no discussion all in favor
 
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
of odd to pass with Amendment 4 Z
 
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.710 align:start position:0%
of odd to pass with Amendment 4 Z
perfect

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
1413 um so this was a bill that came to
 
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
us because there was some concern um
 
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
that um mental health licensed mental
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
health professionals uh when they assume
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility for um somebody would be
 
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
legally responsible for them outside of
 
00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 align:start position:0%
the purview of their professional um
 
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
kind of responsibilities uh when they're
 
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
when they're giving Mental Health
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
Services um and that didn't make any
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
sense so I just wanted to clarify it uh
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
we used language here um that is also in
 
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
um actually the bill that we just did um
 
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
which is RSA
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
33834 and we just changed it to the
 
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
supervisor shall assume professional
 
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
ethical and legal responsibility for
 
00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:24.919 align:start position:0%
mental health services provided by the
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
candidate and a written agreement on
 
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
record with the board so we added uh
 
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
ethical and legal responsibility for
 
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:33.560 align:start position:0%
mental health services provided just to
 
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that you know they were only
 
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
going to be held accountable um when
 
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
they're doing their job and also I I
 
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to keep the legal component in
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
there because I do think that there
 
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
should be some oversight and
 
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
accountability I don't think that they
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
should be without that um so that's
 
00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
basically what this amendment does any
 
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
comments from the
 
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.270 align:start position:0%
comments from the
subcommittee

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:07:57.149 --> 00:07:57.159 align:start position:0%
yes one comment is that we did get
 
00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
testimony that the other Lang in that
 
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
section describing what a supervisory
 
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
agreement was was supported by the by
 
00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:08.550 align:start position:0%
agreement was was supported by the by
the

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
practitioners and this leaves that
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
language in there which I think is
 
00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
better than just a leading at wholesale
 
00:08:18.749 --> 00:08:18.759 align:start position:0%
to get de deal with the clarification
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
yes this will replace the whole bill so
 
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh originally this was going to delete
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
an entire section um of RSA and instead
 
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
of doing that we're just fine-tuning to
 
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
what the actual concern was so I think
 
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
it simplifies it a lot um so uh if
 
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
there's no further discussion I'd
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
motion thanks a to pass so the move is a
 
00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
to pass on Amendment
 
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:49.160 align:start position:0%
1076 do have a second Steve thank you um
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
any discussion I don't think so all in
 
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
four and then having adopted that well
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
or recommending that uh ought to pass
 
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.069 align:start position:0%
or recommending that uh ought to pass
with

00:09:01.069 --> 00:09:01.079 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:05.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment I'll move do have a second red
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
all in favor I perfect we'll make that
 
00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full committee 4
 
00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:18.920 align:start position:0%

good morning uh as we look on page

00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
my team is actually started with nashal
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:21.160 align:start position:0%
nonprofit Standalone
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
organization yes we have union members
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
we have all those things in there but we
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
are not directly connected to to a
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
union or a city town or state okay I'll
 
00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
have to go back and look I didn't ask
 
00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
for a change to that paragraph so I
 
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
don't know what happened there um if
 
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
something shifted was there something in
 
00:10:43.069 --> 00:10:43.079 align:start position:0%
there before that isn't there now I just
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
don't remember off the top of my head uh
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
I don't think it it connected everything
 
00:10:48.079 --> 00:10:51.990 align:start position:0%
I don't think it it connected everything
to

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:56.519 align:start position:0%
that yes it says including members of PE
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
support groups it doesn't say only me
 
00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
all right I just want to make sure okay
 
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
yeah cuz I I didn't touch that paragraph
 
00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
Okay um so for the subcommittee's
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
benefit what we did is uh in this
 
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
amendment if you look on page two um we
 
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.550 align:start position:0%
amendment if you look on page two um we
created

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:17.560 align:start position:0%

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
when it's referred to in the rest of the
 
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
statute you can go back and know what it
 
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
is that we're talking about when we say
 
00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
that um so it says emergency response
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%

telecommunication uh communicators and
 
00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:55.240 align:start position:0%
local dispatchers so we added that
 
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
section so you can make note of that the
 
00:11:59.629 --> 00:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
next one on H um we took into
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
consideration uh representative Smith's
 
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
concern uh we changed the language there
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
from Hospital Emergency Department
 
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
Personnel means staff rendering care
 
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
rescue support and life saving Services
 
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
while working for Andor in the hospital
 
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
emergency department he had that concern
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
that if it was um an employee who was
 
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
not actually in the emergency department
 
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
at the time that they wouldn't be um
 
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
included so uh they can be working for
 
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
or they can be working in there at at
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
the time of the incident or the trauma
 
00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
and still have access to this um so we
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
made that adjustment um line
 
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
25 um when we're talking about uh the
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
certification standards um I wanted to
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
add the commissioner of safety uh to the
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
icisf or similar organization because I
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
felt like if we're legislating this and
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
overseeing this there should be somebody
 
00:12:51.189 --> 00:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
in the government that's the contact
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
point for that and the commissioner of
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
safety seems like the appropriate person
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
to do that um so the commissioner of
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
safety can review the training standards
 
00:13:02.189 --> 00:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature and we do have
 
00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:05.079 align:start position:0%
some level of accountability there um so
 
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
that's another thing that was changed
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
you can note that if you've got concerns
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
let me know
 
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
um didn't change anything there um so
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
represent I still do have a concern I I
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
tried to address it but there didn't
 
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
seem to be a good way to do it we didn't
 
00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
change the language on line four of of
 
00:13:25.949 --> 00:13:25.959 align:start position:0%
three it page three it's exactly what
 
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
you gave to me y um my concern is that
 
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
if you want this to um be accessible to
 
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:35.240 align:start position:0%
retired persons that isn't spelled out
 
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
specifically anywhere and we couldn't
 
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
find anywhere to put it in this
 
00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
particular Amendment but that might be
 
00:13:41.069 --> 00:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
something that you want to give
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
consideration to um so I I know that we
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
mentioned retirees throughout it we do
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
but I think if you go back and you look
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
at it the retirees are people who are
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
providing the services not necessarily
 
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
receiving the
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
services um okay and so just just keep
 
00:13:58.509 --> 00:13:58.519 align:start position:0%
that in mind um when when it goes over
 
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
the I can't do anything about it now I
 
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
was talking with the attorney and um she
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
kept telling me um nor any person so any
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
person receiving the benefits which is
 
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
true but it being a peer support group
 
00:14:12.829 --> 00:14:12.839 align:start position:0%
and not licensed professionals um they
 
00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
have to be a peer and the argument I
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
think could potentially be made that if
 
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
you're retired you're no longer up here
 
00:14:20.749 --> 00:14:20.759 align:start position:0%
it's possible to make that argument and
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
so if you want um and then you wouldn't
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
qualify for the services so you wouldn't
 
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
be included in there um so I tried to
 
00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
get that resolved yesterday we ran out
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
of time um so that's just something you
 
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:33.160 align:start position:0%
might want to keep in mind but that's
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
the language as it came to us and um
 
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
that those were the end of the changes
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
the rest of it is as it came to us um so
 
00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
any comments Carol um just curious
 
00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
you're talking about subsections G and H
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
they're already there are we added G so
 
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
G is new
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
no G right here on line 13 of the amend
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
I only have the original amend
 
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:02.680 align:start position:0%
telecommunicator uh no so it's ch sh
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
I'll give you the we're proposing
 
00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
different I mean I don't object to the
 
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%
to the what you included but
 
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
experience and military occupation
 
00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
especially is determined by oplc because
 
00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:17.559 align:start position:0%
it appears later in the amendment so I'm
 
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that was supposed to come
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
out but I don't know that it's a
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
problem having it in there because
 
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:25.480 align:start position:0%
that's where I had put it but
 
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh the attorney had moved it
 
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
um so uh pretty much on on page one that
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
was the only change that change that had
 
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.230 align:start position:0%
was the only change that change that had
been

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.029 align:start position:0%
been
made

00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't really affect the it's not
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
going to have a negative impact on the
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
legislation all if you look at page
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
three it's on line 10 11 and 12 it says
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
they will determine what that means
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
under 332
 
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.590 align:start position:0%
under 332
G7

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
G7
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
um on page two on line 15 we tossed
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
around the idea to make sure that this
 
00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
bill did include
 
00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
veterans because it wasn't listed on
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
page on three ABCD on page three but on
 
00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
page two we decided to put veterans into
 
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
the title on line
 
00:18:27.549 --> 00:18:27.559 align:start position:0%
15 changing it from an spouse or
 
00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
temporary lure
 
00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure veterans was in there uh
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
the attorney had
 
00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
put military service members and their
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
families and Veterans and representative
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
Simon had some concern about what did
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
and families mean which I think is fear
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
so I changed that back to military
 
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
service members spouse and Veterans and
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard any uh throwback from
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
the attorney on that there was real
 
00:18:59.789 --> 00:18:59.799 align:start position:0%
quick a question on that um
 
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
when you go down another line um and
 
00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:04.919 align:start position:0%
maybe this isn't a concern maybe it's
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
just automatically included because it's
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
in the title but it says the office of
 
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
professional lenser and certification
 
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
shall issue temporary licenses to a
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
member of the Armed uh forces or their
 
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
spouse once again veterans isn't listed
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
there is that necessary or is member of
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
the Armed Forces adequate oh um uh the
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
AG in general might be able to answer
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
that better but I think on his face said
 
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
he wanted to say something
 
00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
please and he may be able to clarify I I
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
think uh page page page two lines 16 and
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
17 I know that there's uh sometimes a
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
difference in the language between
 
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
active members and Veterans and I just
 
00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that what is listed
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
will cover the veterans because that's
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
kind of the point right I I think that
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
that temporary lure was more to to
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
handle when active military members are
 
00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
going in their three-year change over to
 
00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:11.559 align:start position:0%
a different base that they can more
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
easily get a license for their spouse
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
yeah so representative I I think I think
 
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
if you look at 310 I'm not sure for for
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
sure I think it's okay okay you look at
 
00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
31016 specifically talks about uh the
 
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
portability of licenses for military
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
members who are transfering into the
 
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
state so I think we addressed a veterans
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
piece earlier in this part of the
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
legislation so I think it's really two
 
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
different things I'll I'll read this
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
really comprehensively while you
 
00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
continue to talk to make sure that
 
00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
that's the case but I know 31016 talks
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
specifically about portability of
 
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
licenses for spouses who follow their
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
their military uh member into the state
 
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
based on orders right so I think that's
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
what that deals with so I think we're
 
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
okay in that particular section I'll
 
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
look to make sure veterans are covered
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
in other parts of the bill give me a few
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
seconds Mr chair your program looks like
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
it Deals Only with
 
00:21:06.159 --> 00:21:07.909 align:start position:0%
it Deals Only with
veterans

00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
so uh Mr chair yes so I think uh in in
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
one of the iterations so
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
unpaid where you were on on uh line 16
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
has changed to Roman numeral one and
 
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
then on page three on line three no
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 2 is added to that section
 
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
law and I had added e on there in one of
 
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
the iterations where I just put veterans
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
and attorney uh from oplc took that out
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
and I think we talked about this that
 
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
the they felt that putting veterans in
 
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
the title was adequate for that I I
 
00:21:47.269 --> 00:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
would kind of like to see an e in there
 
00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:49.799 align:start position:0%
that says veterans
 
00:21:49.799 --> 00:21:51.710 align:start position:0%
that says veterans
yeah

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:54.039 align:start position:0%
okay yeah uh once again if you're
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
comfortable with it and you think it's
 
00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
going to accomplish it I'm I'm fine with
 
00:21:58.269 --> 00:21:58.279 align:start position:0%
it I just wanted to make sure that was
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
the only thing when I was rereading
 
00:22:00.909 --> 00:22:00.919 align:start position:0%
through it that kind of jumped out at me
 
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
as potential problem to verify I don't
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
see an issue with it I mean and and
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
again some of this will be addressed in
 
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules at oplc I don't
 
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
I don't want to speak for director
 
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
Courtney or or uh or or the
 
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
attorney but some of it will be
 
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
addressed in the administrative rules
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
piece and specifically the RFP that
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
they're working so that to rewrite the
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
rules will have significant input into
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
that that piece U yeah we just need to
 
00:22:27.269 --> 00:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
make sure we've given them the pieces to
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
do it so y think so
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
okay anything else representative
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
Brown uh no I think just for uh
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
representive Maguire's
 
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
edification 332 G7 Roman numeral 1 we
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
did have a change that in this amendment
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
and it got taken
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
out that requires all boards
 
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
to make rules regarding crosswalks Andor
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
matrixes matrices which according to
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
director Courtney either hasn't been
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
done or it's not anywhere near complete
 
00:23:07.269 --> 00:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
hasn't been done would be my guess okay
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
so she originally had put in an
 
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
amendment at at the end of this
 
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
amendment she originally had put in that
 
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
would have oplc do all the rul making
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
for that Matrix
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
creation for boards that are under oplc
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
and then I said what about the ones that
 
00:23:30.669 --> 00:23:30.679 align:start position:0%
aren't EMS really specifically M and we
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
decided that the
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee because that was a late
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
introduction that we couldn't throw that
 
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
into the amendment now because those
 
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
boards wouldn't have known about this so
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
uh adant Deputy adant General said he
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
would be willing to bring that to the
 
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
Senate and we could try to do that as an
 
00:23:49.149 --> 00:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
amendment in the
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
Senate if just just again I give you the
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
history of that so all of that has
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
removed that makes I think that's what
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
we talked about and that makes sense
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
right is what we talked
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
about I think the um EMT licensing is
 
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.310 align:start position:0%
about I think the um EMT licensing is
it's

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
National so there should be a good uh
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
understanding of what the military
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
training is I hope so you're you're
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
correct if you if you if that was a
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
question you are correct so on the Army
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
side if you are a combat medic you're
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
licensed in the National Registry of
 
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
EMTs and whether or not the state grad
 
00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:29.799 align:start position:0%
you know grants that license and they
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
should if they're in the National
 
00:24:32.669 --> 00:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
Registry there are caveats you have to
 
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
continue your cus there's some other
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
things to maintain that lenser but you
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
are correct
 
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
represent Mr chair when I first started
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
researching this I did talk to
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
a bureau chief at EMS whose Name Escapes
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
me and he did say that there there there
 
00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
is that some of that direct crossover
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
but that only applies to military
 
00:24:54.389 --> 00:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
members who are able to or required to
 
00:24:56.389 --> 00:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
get a national certification which many
 
00:24:59.230 --> 00:24:59.240 align:start position:0%
of the Medics are not still and if I
 
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
understand that correctly so not not all
 
00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
Medics are maintain that military
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
occupational specialty so there are some
 
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
FLOTUS for example wouldn't necessarily
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
be you know a combat medic and maintain
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
that EMT certification there was there
 
00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:14.039 align:start position:0%
are some other caveats there but they
 
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
could be licensed to be FLOTUS it just
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
they would don't need a license to be a
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
flomist I'm sorry there's no license
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
required to be a flomist I'll draw your
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
blood a little later
 
00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:28.039 align:start position:0%
representative nice seriously that's
 
00:25:30.909 --> 00:25:30.919 align:start position:0%
something that the whoever hires you is
 
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for making sure you're
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
license uh any other comments or I think
 
00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much I think that's pretty
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
much everything we talked about I'm I'm
 
00:25:48.669 --> 00:25:48.679 align:start position:0%
I'm happy with it the way it is as long
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
as page one line 15 and 16 attorney
 
00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:54.919 align:start position:0%
uster and yeah and director Courtney are
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
okay with that being D duplicative kind
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
of I right see it's a problem that's um
 
00:26:00.909 --> 00:26:00.919 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean that's the kind of thing we
 
00:26:02.669 --> 00:26:02.679 align:start position:0%
might be able to pull out later or in
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
the Senate so since we're going to have
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.789 --> 00:26:15.799 align:start position:0%
um maybe
 
00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:19.240 align:start position:0%
um whatever I I don't think it's
 
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
necessary but I don't think it's a
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
problem yeah well we're not we're not
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
going to touch it anyway that'll be
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
something they have to do on the other
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
side of the wall I suppose if they want
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
to well if you simply wanted to delete
 
00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
it we could get a we could get a quickly
 
00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.110 align:start position:0%
it we could get a we could get a quickly
revised

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
revised
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment but if we don't if you're
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
you're happy with it we can just leave
 
00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.909 align:start position:0%
you're happy with it we can just leave
it

00:26:42.909 --> 00:26:42.919 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
there for example where you could keep
 
00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:48.200 align:start position:0%
your your training as a FLOTUS and show
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
it to the
 
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
hospital or the Red
 
00:26:54.669 --> 00:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
Cross there you go the only thing I'll
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
say is that that U the attorney had
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
moved that out in one one of the
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
iterations and I'm not quite sure how it
 
00:27:02.389 --> 00:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
well we had a few going around so they
 
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
got yeah yeah you've got to got to keep
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
your eye on them just for clarification
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the other boards not
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
covered by oplc is that what we're
 
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
talking about now we're talking about
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
something different no we're on page one
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
under the definition of license yeah it
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
was commensurate training and and the
 
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
oplc had taken that out it doesn't have
 
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
to be I don't think it has to be in here
 
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
are you more comfortable if we strike
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
it I'm comfortable with whatever will
 
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
make this go through if if we strike it
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
in the Senate that's but this is
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
describing what the veteran the VAP is
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
doing yeah all right and they may be
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
able to say oh yes you've got your fotus
 
00:27:44.509 --> 00:27:44.519 align:start position:0%
certification in New Hampshire you don't
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
need a license you're good I think or
 
00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
even more appropriately electricians for
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
example we passed some registration last
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
year about experiencing electricians to
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
surpass their apprenticeship period
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
right so the vlap would be able to say
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
this is what the law says this is what
 
00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
your training says you should be able to
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
go to the board and make this this go so
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
I think it's I think it's important to
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
have it spelled out in both places I I
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think it's I don't think
 
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
it hurts anything for it to be clarified
 
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
yeah it's not I don't think it's hurting
 
00:28:16.509 --> 00:28:16.519 align:start position:0%
anything for sure
 
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
okay and and then I'll just reiterate do
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
we want to add on page three under Roman
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
numeral 2 do we want to put an e for
 
00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
veterans so that Roman numeral 2 falls
 
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
under three
 
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
uh P line 15 on page
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
two but it doesn't say veterans and I
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
had put it in there and and oplc said
 
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
they didn't need it but I don't think
 
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's this section says that they shall
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
facilitate and if there are I think that
 
00:28:48.669 --> 00:28:48.679 align:start position:0%
it's nice to include it would be
 
00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate to include veterans and the
 
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
line which is essentially what that does
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
yeah um I'm I'm good with doing that do
 
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
you want to take on the responsibility
 
00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:05.720 align:start position:0%
of getting it in there before exec yeah
 
00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
or can we I mean we could push this back
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
to next week too if we need we would
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
really we've got a couple of big ones
 
00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:12.519 align:start position:0%
pushed back to next week so I would
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
really rather get it done get a simple
 
00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
one line change yeah so we can I mean we
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
can we can recommend it with knowing
 
00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
that the line change is coming and then
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
we'll just have to look at the final
 
00:29:26.509 --> 00:29:26.519 align:start position:0%
version Oh add that as e you think or
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
yeah y okay and sounds okay on your sure
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
yeah it's just just clarification
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%

01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
um the amendment
 
01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
turns the bill into uh a bill that would
 
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
provide New Hampshire that New Hampshire
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
shall exempt itself from daylight
 
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
savings time when authorized to do so by
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
the United States Congress and this
 
01:04:09.549 --> 01:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
committee knows we've had many many
 
01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
bills over the years before my time even
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
for um making this change people don't
 
01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
like the time change and they want it to
 
01:04:20.829 --> 01:04:20.839 align:start position:0%
change we heard a lot of testimony that
 
01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
we need to stay in step with the states
 
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
that border us for reasons of work and
 
01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:27.880 align:start position:0%
and family life and for lotss of
 
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
different reasons so um I did a little
 
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
research and found that the states are
 
01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
coming together 11 states have already
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
passed bills main being one of them that
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
would make the change when Congress
 
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
authorizes the states to do so so I got
 
01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment drawn up to uh
 
01:04:49.269 --> 01:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan who submitted the
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
original Bill supports the amendment and
 
01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh I think this will put New Hampshire
 
01:04:57.269 --> 01:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
in the queue with the States in line
 
01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:00.039 align:start position:0%
with our bordering state of Maine to um
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
make the change when Congress approves
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
it right representative BR do you wish
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%

01:05:10.829 --> 01:05:10.839 align:start position:0%

01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:12.680 align:start position:0%

I'd like to move the we um that we
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
pass how ought to pass with with
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%

01:06:44.349 --> 01:06:44.359 align:start position:0%
your new motion I think I said
 
01:06:47.549 --> 01:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
everything previously Madam chair okay
 
01:06:52.589 --> 01:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
repr gr I agree with representative G
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to say that it's very very
 
01:06:58.750 --> 01:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
elegant because it's much simpler to say
 
01:07:01.549 --> 01:07:01.559 align:start position:0%
when Congress tells us we can we will
 
01:07:04.109 --> 01:07:04.119 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to petition
 
01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
repeatedly yes and just to um clarify I
 
01:07:14.349 --> 01:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
believe 11 states have already done this
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
so there is a nationwide group that's
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
tabulating these bills across the
 
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
country and Congress will hear what the
 
01:07:25.950 --> 01:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
people are wanting them to do thank you
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
and I I will say this was the first time
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
we've had a similar Bill where we did
 
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
not have to beat up on the fact that the
 
01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
time changes are stressful and dangerous
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
because everybody agreed to that so it's
 
01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
it was a nice touch all right any other
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
comments questions Madam chair yes yes I
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
I think uh long-term members of this
 
01:07:59.269 --> 01:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
committee realize that uh I have opposed
 
01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
this idea for many years um dependent on
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that I felt it should be
 
01:08:09.029 --> 01:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
Nationwide so I find myself able to
 
01:08:09.039 --> 01:08:10.109 align:start position:0%
Nationwide so I find myself able to
support

01:08:10.109 --> 01:08:10.119 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:08:13.829 --> 01:08:13.839 align:start position:0%

01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
representative Simon to speak to it
 
01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
since it's his Amendment and I did this
 
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
only to start the
 
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
conversation okay representative
 
01:10:38.110 --> 01:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
G um I I'm interested to hear what
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
representative Simon has to say all
 
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
right representative Simon you're on I
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
apologize to the Comm for my tardiness
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
let's jump in um thank you for moving
 
01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment in seconding uh so this
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
deals with critical incident stress
 
01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
management teams uh it's a peer support
 
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
group um that uh was in um Public Safety
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
or emergency response and Public Safety
 
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
workers allowing people who have gone
 
01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
through a traumatic experience to talk
 
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
to one of their colleagues as opposed to
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
going to professional um counselor who
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
may or may not understand the
 
01:11:09.310 --> 01:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
complexities of of what they deal with
 
01:11:13.229 --> 01:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
out in the field um so uh the original
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
bill was one line it came to us uh as a
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
five-page Amendment so it was sent to
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so that we could look at it
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
more in depthly um I'll just point out
 
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
real quickly to the changes um on page
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
two line three we've added a definition
 
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
for emergency sponse Public Safety
 
01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
worker and everybody who falls under
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
that category simply so that as it comes
 
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
up in the rest of the statute uh you can
 
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
refer back to this and know exactly what
 
01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
it is that we're talking about it gets
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
rid of the ambiguity um the second thing
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
of notes starting on line nine um this
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
was the main purpose they originally
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
brought the bill for they wanted to make
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
sure that uh emergency hospital uh
 
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
Hospital Emergency Department Personnel
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
were covered uh under this kind of
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
agreement and uh so I've adjusted the
 
01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
language a little bit it now says
 
01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
Hospital Emergency Department Personnel
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
means staff rendering care rescue
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
support and life- saving Services while
 
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
working for Andor in the hospital
 
01:12:13.189 --> 01:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
emergency department uh representative
 
01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
schmith that was primarily for your
 
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
concern that if they were outside of the
 
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
space they would still be covered so
 
01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
you're welcome so that's in there
 
01:12:26.669 --> 01:12:26.679 align:start position:0%
um let's see uh on line 25 of page two
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
um it talks about um the CR
 
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
International critical incident stress
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
Foundation which would set um the
 
01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:37.719 align:start position:0%
certification standards and also uh
 
01:12:41.189 --> 01:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
maintain training um requirements uh I
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
added in on line 25 and also the
 
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner of safety since we're
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
covering the in statute I felt like it
 
01:12:48.149 --> 01:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
was only reasonable that there should be
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
somebody some government entity that
 
01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
oversaw what they were doing and not
 
01:12:54.629 --> 01:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
just some other organization and uh we
 
01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
talking with everybody the commissioner
 
01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
of safety seems like the appropriate
 
01:13:00.149 --> 01:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
person um to just make sure that what's
 
01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
going on um there's some accountability
 
01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
there um and secondarily then
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
accountability to us so um line 28 they
 
01:13:11.709 --> 01:13:11.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that members who uh
 
01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:13.400 align:start position:0%
were a part of these teams could be
 
01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
retired um Public Safety
 
01:13:19.629 --> 01:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
workers um so that they could continue
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:27.270 align:start position:0%
 
there

01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:30.189 --> 01:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
so and then at the end of the amendment
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
um they
 
01:13:34.189 --> 01:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
took what was uh deemed to be
 
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
confidential uh and they flushed that
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
out to a greater degree so the the
 
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
principles are are similar uh just with
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
more detail uh so that was already in
 
01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
statute but they wanted to add some
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
distinctives to it so that's flushed out
 
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
there the subcommittee thought that the
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
changes were reasonable and helpful um
 
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
and so we bringing it to the full
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
pass questions comments concerns
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
represent V thank you madam chair um
 
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
just a question about uh page three uh
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
line 21
 
01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
to 35 The Suicide
 
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
Prevention um is this applicable to all
 
01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
emergency respond ERS that are
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
responding to a call from a
 
01:14:31.229 --> 01:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
distressed First
 
01:14:33.189 --> 01:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
Responders thank you for the question
 
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
representative so this um this section
 
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
just deals with what will not be deemed
 
01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
confidential uh when they're talking
 
01:14:42.189 --> 01:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
with each other so if any of these
 
01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
things are brought up um in one of their
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
meetings and there's a question about it
 
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
um they will have to divulge that
 
01:14:51.629 --> 01:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
information um because it's too it's too
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
important that people would be able to
 
01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
respond to it so that's that's all that
 
01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
that deals with thank you
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
yep representa I just want to make sure
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
so in line nine and 10 did you change
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
the definition of the hospital emergency
 
01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
department personnel uh thank you
 
01:15:11.229 --> 01:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
representative yeah we um ju I just
 
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
adjusted uh let me get there um so on
 
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
line 10 you'll see that it says for
 
01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
Andor in that was the only change and
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
the reason we made that change uh
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
originally it was in the hospital
 
01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
emergency department and there was some
 
01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
concern from the subcommittee that
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
somebody who worked for um the emergency
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
department would be outside of the
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
department at the time that they
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
encountered the incident trying to help
 
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
and that they would not have access to
 
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
these services so I just changed it to
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
say that if you're working for the
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
hospital emergency department or in
 
01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
Andor in the hospital emergency
 
01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
department then you would have access to
 
01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:47.430 align:start position:0%
department then you would have access to
these

01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
you yeah I'd like to add to that this
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
would also cover other Hospital
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
Personnel who were called into emergency
 
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
as might be the case if there was a a
 
01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
disaster that wanted all the help they
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
could get so your your other staff might
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
be working in the emergency department
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
and would be covered would be able to
 
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%

lot of work on this very well crafted
 
01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
we've tried to include virtually
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
every kind of situation that we could
 
01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
conceive of uh and to protect these very
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
important people um being exposed to in
 
01:17:51.629 --> 01:17:51.639 align:start position:0%
very serious stress so I think this is a
 
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.669 --> 01:18:00.679 align:start position:0%

01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
uh colleagues uh this bill is brought on
 
01:20:02.709 --> 01:20:02.719 align:start position:0%
behalf of the uh New Hampshire
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
Commission on Native American Affairs uh
 
01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
which has been uh working on uh the
 
01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
amendment for some time with regard to
 
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
um facilitating their ability to
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
function which has been hampered by the
 
01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
fact that they uh do not have a fully
 
01:20:24.990 --> 01:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
appointed membership and there for
 
01:20:27.149 --> 01:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
Quorum has been very difficult for them
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
to obtain that's a and and this will
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully alleviate that
 
01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:36.639 align:start position:0%
situation um and uh a couple of other
 
01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:38.719 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
um aspects where we have struck out um
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
some existing federal statute I believe
 
01:20:50.830 --> 01:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
someone may be able to speak to this
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
that we have some people from the
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
commission here this morning uh if they
 
01:20:59.669 --> 01:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
they uh would be allowed to confirm um
 
01:21:02.910 --> 01:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
that some of the federal statutes uh are
 
01:21:05.790 --> 01:21:05.800 align:start position:0%
out of date um and
 
01:21:08.189 --> 01:21:08.199 align:start position:0%
so that has been worked on and I'm not
 
01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
sure exactly I know that um Ben uh
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
Wilson from the Department from the
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
agency said he would attempt to be here
 
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
today I don't know whether he's been
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
able to make it or not because I don't
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
know him personally
 
01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
I guess he's not here okay um thank
 
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
you madam chair that's enough do we have
 
01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
copies of
 
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
that what it's it's the original bill
 
01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:37.110 align:start position:0%
that what it's it's the original bill
it's

01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
147 there's no
 
01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry I I quite understand your
 
01:21:45.229 --> 01:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
confusion but occasionally we do pass a
 
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:50.669 --> 01:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment all right representative G
 
01:21:52.590 --> 01:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just wanted to
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
say that um I've made the motion
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
originally for interim study because of
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
some concerns about um the future as we
 
01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
move forward this committee as people
 
01:22:06.669 --> 01:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
know passed a a bill for a study
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
committee and so I was concerned about
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
any possible inconsistencies with uh
 
01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
approving a bill this year and then next
 
01:22:16.189 --> 01:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
year study committee coming back with
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
different recommendations and I've been
 
01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
assured that that won't be an issue and
 
01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
I'm really happy to support the work of
 
01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:24.199 align:start position:0%
the commission and look forward to the
 
01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
work together to uh to move
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
ahead I think the the largest part of
 
01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is essentially establishing
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
the Quorum and the membership such that
 
01:22:39.709 --> 01:22:39.719 align:start position:0%
the commission can work and the study
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
committee is to evaluate what it's
 
01:22:45.550 --> 01:22:45.560 align:start position:0%
working on and that can be done while
 
01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
the commission um proceeds with the
 
01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
business anyone
 
01:22:58.470 --> 01:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
else all right in that case the motion
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass by representative
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%

01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:06.880 align:start position:0%

consent it pass 20 to
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
Z all right seeing no no objection we'll
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
put that on
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
1420 that one I thought we had voted on
 
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
already but it's not in the system so I
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
would like to get it revoted on
 
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
motion uh my recollection is I I would
 
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
make a motion for interim
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:26.709 align:start position:0%
 
motion

01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:29.310 --> 01:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion uh
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
just as a reminder this was a bill to
 
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
have state agencies call anyone that was
 
01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
in contact with them call them back
 
01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
within three days and we had quite a bit
 
01:24:40.590 --> 01:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
of discussion about how complicated that
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
could get but it wasn't a bad idea to
 
01:24:45.669 --> 01:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
make sure agencies were providing
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
adequate public service so the interim
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
study was uh proposed Madame chair we
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
seem to have a disagreement in that we
 
01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
have people here who have a vote count
 
01:24:59.149 --> 01:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
from February 14th it was not okay it
 
01:25:03.149 --> 01:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
was not included in the somehow it never
 
01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
got in so it was not included into the
 
01:25:08.910 --> 01:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
official it's not did somehow it didn't
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
get into the official record
 
01:25:15.109 --> 01:25:15.119 align:start position:0%
so I presume representative goalie that
 
01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:17.480 align:start position:0%
the vote was in fact pretty much
 
01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
unanimous for interms St it was 1521 I
 
01:25:22.430 --> 01:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
had representative Gro to make the
 
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
motion representative Le a second and
 
01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
this was done
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
214 and put on consent I
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
agree yeah my record shows that to fine
 
01:25:38.229 --> 01:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
I thought so myself but it's okay so
 
01:25:42.629 --> 01:25:42.639 align:start position:0%
what do why don't we do it again either
 
01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:46.360 align:start position:0%
that or just vote to confirm that vote
 
01:25:50.550 --> 01:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
that since we'd already did it um then I
 
01:25:52.990 --> 01:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
would uh resend my motion that's okay
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
it's the the same result I believe and
 
01:25:59.510 --> 01:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
and Madam shair as we know all these
 
01:26:01.790 --> 01:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
hearings are recorded So it's very easy
 
01:26:03.310 --> 01:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
for somebody to go back pull the tape on
 
01:26:05.669 --> 01:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
the 14th to see that we did do this so
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how I got lost in the
 
01:26:08.159 --> 01:26:09.790 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how I got lost in the
paperwork

01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
paperwork
 
01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
but I guess things happen and it's
 
01:26:16.750 --> 01:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
probably probably got sent in my spam
 
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
folder and uh but the good news is that
 
01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
we keep the same vote so that's actually
 
01:26:25.629 --> 01:26:25.639 align:start position:0%
we're very consistent right uh huh
 
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
yes I would say also if if we are going
 
01:26:32.669 --> 01:26:32.679 align:start position:0%
to redo Would we not have to withdraw
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
the previous
 
01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
vote that's
 
01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:39.550 align:start position:0%
vote that's
why

01:26:39.550 --> 01:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:26:42.510 --> 01:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
well Madam chair would you like a motion
 
01:26:45.189 --> 01:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
well we have a motion we have probably
 
01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
dozen motions Madam chair I I think we
 
01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
should confer with the clerk's office
 
01:26:53.229 --> 01:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
since it's a clear case that we that
 
01:26:56.830 --> 01:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
represented there there you are Mi Mr
 
01:26:58.669 --> 01:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
Greenland good
 
01:27:02.430 --> 01:27:02.440 align:start position:0%
morning an issue has come up where House
 
01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:03.990 align:start position:0%
morning an issue has come up where House
Bill

01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:27:06.750 --> 01:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
1420 was voted
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
on on February
 
01:27:14.590 --> 01:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
14th it doesn't seem to be in the system
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
we don't disagree with the previous
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation how do what do we need to
 
01:27:23.109 --> 01:27:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:23.119 --> 01:27:25.070 align:start position:0%
 
system

01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
it was exec in
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
committee with a recommendation of
 
01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:33.510 align:start position:0%
committee with a recommendation of
interim

01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
study and we were only 15 16 that day 15
 
01:27:40.990 --> 01:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
I believe that was the day of the
 
01:27:44.430 --> 01:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
hearing yeah so if you could if you
 
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
could confirm exactly what it is we need
 
01:27:52.030 --> 01:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
point that's correct it is not in the
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
system as having happened but we have
 
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
memories thank you we will uh not do
 
01:28:11.669 --> 01:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
anything more until we discover what the
 
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
easiest way to get this settled is
 
01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
because there's no disagreement on that
 
01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
one all right how about 1456 representa
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
groto you have a motion
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
yes I move aop pass on House Bill
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
1456 is there a
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
second I'll second okay seconded by
 
01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:41.189 align:start position:0%
second I'll second okay seconded by
representative

01:28:41.189 --> 01:28:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:43.229 --> 01:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
Shu okay you wish to speak to your
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
motion I'd love
 
01:28:49.109 --> 01:28:49.119 align:start position:0%
to so some of us might remember because
 
01:28:51.109 --> 01:28:51.119 align:start position:0%
this is one of those bills
 
01:28:55.229 --> 01:28:55.239 align:start position:0%
that can be difficult to remember
 
01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
that it involved the board of tax and
 
01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:58.189 align:start position:0%
that it involved the board of tax and
land

01:28:58.189 --> 01:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
land
 
01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
appeals and that recommendations had
 
01:29:04.109 --> 01:29:04.119 align:start position:0%
been made that in the bill rather than
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court making the appointment
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
to the board of tax and lands appeal the
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court would vet the candidates
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
but that the appointments would be made
 
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
by the governor and the executive
 
01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
Council and the reason why this was
 
01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
important is that when the members are
 
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
appointed by the Su Court there really
 
01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
isn't time there
 
01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.510 align:start position:0%
isn't time there
isn't

01:29:28.510 --> 01:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh the availability of public
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
opinion whereas in the when the when the
 
01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
position is appointed by the governor
 
01:29:40.270 --> 01:29:40.280 align:start position:0%
and the executive Council public opinion
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
is part of the process and so the board
 
01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
actually supports this and um it made
 
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
sense to me that we should do it this
 
01:29:51.790 --> 01:29:51.800 align:start position:0%
way so that the public has an
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to um make opinion on who
 
01:29:58.669 --> 01:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
the members of the board in tax and land
 
01:30:01.109 --> 01:30:01.119 align:start position:0%
appeals are the other
 
01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
um the questions that were that the
 
01:30:06.189 --> 01:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
committee had I can go over them but
 
01:30:11.189 --> 01:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
were very um process oriented and um
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
satisfied the bill does answer the
 
01:30:15.950 --> 01:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
questions that we had so I would support
 
01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
I would I would like the committee to
 
01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
support the OTP motion of House Bill
 
01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
1456 thank you representative shu
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%
yes we did hear that um this board is
 
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
considered I think the term was quasi
 
01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
judicial and therefore uh it seemed
 
01:30:35.790 --> 01:30:35.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the appointments to be
 
01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:37.400 align:start position:0%
made in this
 
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
manner okay any other comments represent
 
01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair the only
 
01:30:46.510 --> 01:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
question I have is and I'm looking back
 
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
at my notes Here was on line three
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
changing the appointment from three
 
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
years to five years was a recommendation
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that yes representative
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
yes that
 
01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
well some people didn't care and some
 
01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
people wanted to keep it for five years
 
01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
for um
 
01:31:11.310 --> 01:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
continuity but I didn't there was no
 
01:31:13.629 --> 01:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
amendment to do
 
01:31:16.750 --> 01:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
so I didn't I don't I don't have any I
 
01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
have one person saying that they thought
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
five years was better and another person
 
01:31:25.149 --> 01:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
saying that it didn't really matter to
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
them Madam chair I did have in my notes
 
01:31:32.350 --> 01:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
that uh testimony was that prior to
 
01:31:35.229 --> 01:31:35.239 align:start position:0%
2011 they had five-year terms so it's
 
01:31:39.629 --> 01:31:39.639 align:start position:0%
not totally out of the realm of of
 
01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
reliability I guess is the word I'm
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:46.870 align:start position:0%
looking for
okay

01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:31:49.629 --> 01:31:49.639 align:start position:0%
any do we wish do we wish to amend it
 
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
for fiveyear terms or or not bother
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
represent it is there any uh interest
 
01:31:55.199 --> 01:31:56.669 align:start position:0%
represent it is there any uh interest
representative

01:31:56.669 --> 01:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:32:00.109 --> 01:32:00.119 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam chairman so uh I
 
01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
serve on the board of um the assessing
 
01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
Standards Board uh for some time I think
 
01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
it's about 16 years uh and the board of
 
01:32:13.709 --> 01:32:13.719 align:start position:0%
tax and land appeals is a very important
 
01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
institution and kind of a special
 
01:32:18.669 --> 01:32:18.679 align:start position:0%
special breed of cat but it could use a
 
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of of modernization which has
 
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
already been spoken to so I think this
 
01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
is U we should proceed in this fashion
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
and this will benefit the stability and
 
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
also the continuity of the board of tax
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair uh it just one
 
01:34:21.430 --> 01:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph that was added to the original
 
01:34:25.470 --> 01:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
bill in this uh Amendment and uh if you
 
01:34:31.470 --> 01:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
remember uh this was at the hearing it
 
01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
added um not
 
01:34:37.950 --> 01:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
withstanding the blur from nine five n
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
line five to 10 so this just amends it
 
01:34:46.669 --> 01:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
tad bit
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
so clarifies rather not Tad clarifies
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
the fact that when the sub of property
 
01:34:58.189 --> 01:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
may be transferred and it uh clarifies
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:12.229 align:start position:0%
 
DD

01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:14.830 --> 01:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
okay representative BR do you have a
 
01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to your second I do thank
 
01:35:21.229 --> 01:35:21.239 align:start position:0%
you so um Ben Frost from the New
 
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing um mentioned that they
 
01:35:28.350 --> 01:35:28.360 align:start position:0%
have the preemptive right to this um
 
01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
State these State Properties but they
 
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
felt that Pro profit or nonprofit
 
01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
organizations should be included in this
 
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
they should have the same availability
 
01:35:42.990 --> 01:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
so I think that's what this this bill
 
01:35:47.229 --> 01:35:47.239 align:start position:0%
does it gives them the right to do so um
 
01:35:51.149 --> 01:35:51.159 align:start position:0%
and that was as a so this amendment came
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
forth from the recommendation at this
 
01:35:56.830 --> 01:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
sub at the Committee
 
01:36:00.669 --> 01:36:00.679 align:start position:0%
hearing okay any Madam chair another
 
01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
clarification this was my goof up I had
 
01:36:07.390 --> 01:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
the language and I was going to bring
 
01:36:09.310 --> 01:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment and I
 
01:36:12.109 --> 01:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
totally forgot about it until this
 
01:36:14.590 --> 01:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
morning like yesterday so I got the
 
01:36:17.950 --> 01:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
amendment in a rush so this specific
 
01:36:21.109 --> 01:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
language was given by Ben Frost which
 
01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
was uh you know housing trusts this is
 
01:36:29.229 --> 01:36:29.239 align:start position:0%
exactly it clarifies so that's my fault
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you other comments representa yeah
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
just for clarification this amendment
 
01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
though because um it does take the New
 
01:36:38.669 --> 01:36:38.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing bureau out of the
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
running because they're not a nonprofit
 
01:36:43.390 --> 01:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
organization but he felt that it was
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
important to do so so um that just
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
clarifies that there's no motive or
 
01:36:59.950 --> 01:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:01.709 --> 01:37:01.719 align:start position:0%
no uh no comment on the amendment I will
 
01:37:06.750 --> 01:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:10.229 --> 01:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
amended I just wanted to thank U Mr
 
01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
Frost and congratulate him on his
 
01:37:14.109 --> 01:37:14.119 align:start position:0%

01:39:27.629 --> 01:39:27.639 align:start position:0%
been said Madam okay representative luus
 
01:39:29.550 --> 01:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I have a
 
01:39:32.030 --> 01:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
problem with this
 
01:39:36.790 --> 01:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
and I have a concern where um things are
 
01:39:39.790 --> 01:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
funded you not in an open manner I mean
 
01:39:43.109 --> 01:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
if we're going to give money for um this
 
01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
sort of thing I would say that the uh
 
01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
property should be sold at fair market
 
01:39:51.109 --> 01:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
value and then if the legislature
 
01:39:54.669 --> 01:39:54.679 align:start position:0%
decides to provide money for um for
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
other things such as housing then that
 
01:39:58.350 --> 01:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
should be done through a bill or the
 
01:40:02.350 --> 01:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
normal budgeting process uh um I'm sure
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
the motive of everybody here is is fine
 
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
trying to help but it it seems to me
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
that it it looks like kind of a a way of
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
hiding spending um where it should be
 
01:40:14.950 --> 01:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
more in the open at least if I
 
01:40:16.830 --> 01:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
understand what this is doing
 
01:40:21.310 --> 01:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
correctly represent Manti um there is no
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
money given for housing it is the sale
 
01:40:28.830 --> 01:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
of the property on a surplus property uh
 
01:40:32.350 --> 01:40:32.360 align:start position:0%
from my understanding uh this what the
 
01:40:35.950 --> 01:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
Housing Authority has the prior dip and
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
not every property that's available for
 
01:40:41.669 --> 01:40:41.679 align:start position:0%
development that the Housing Authority
 
01:40:46.350 --> 01:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
can uh do it so they can partner uh with
 
01:40:49.709 --> 01:40:49.719 align:start position:0%
with the housing crisis so it's the
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
properties Lee
 
01:40:55.390 --> 01:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
or say the property exactly
 
01:40:57.550 --> 01:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
representative leus you were wanted to
 
01:40:59.589 --> 01:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
continue I understand that the issue is
 
01:41:03.070 --> 01:41:03.080 align:start position:0%
if you sell something at less than fair
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
market value then you're foregoing uh
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
revenue for the state which is in a
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
sense the essentially the same thing as
 
01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
as giving the money away uh to something
 
01:41:16.990 --> 01:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
so that's why I have a problem with
 
01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
it representative Simon you
 
01:41:21.629 --> 01:41:21.639 align:start position:0%
representative gold thank you so much
 
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
Madam chair in my opinion this is not
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
mandating that the property be sold
 
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:30.639 align:start position:0%
below fair market value it simply is
 
01:41:32.589 --> 01:41:32.599 align:start position:0%
allowing the flexibility for the state
 
01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
to make choices that serve the situation
 
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
properties repr Simon thank you madam
 
01:41:45.950 --> 01:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
chair um perhaps this did go to
 
01:41:50.189 --> 01:41:50.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee no not exactly okay um my
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
original concern with the bill and
 
01:41:54.750 --> 01:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
represent man P maybe you can speak to
 
01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:56.550 align:start position:0%
represent man P maybe you can speak to
this

01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:41:59.470 --> 01:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
um was that we're we're giving these
 
01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
properties to a non-government entity at
 
01:42:05.550 --> 01:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
below fair market value
 
01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
and I I I think your Amendment here is
 
01:42:11.189 --> 01:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
trying to deal with it my concern is
 
01:42:13.950 --> 01:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
that you know this isn't in perpetuity
 
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh it's not a forever thing that they
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
have to hold these standards eventually
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
they're free and clear of the government
 
01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
intervention and they can do whatever
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
they want with the property um did we
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
ever find out what that limitation was
 
01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
like how long they have to keep to this
 
01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
agreement before they can do something
 
01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
else I would ask uh Ben Frost Mr benen
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
Frost if he could
 
01:42:41.550 --> 01:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
ask the language came specifically from
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
the housing if that's appropriate Mr
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:52.109 --> 01:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair uh
 
01:42:53.790 --> 01:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
committee members good morning
 
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
I'm Ben Frost I'm the deputy executive
 
01:42:57.470 --> 01:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
director and chief legal officer at New
 
01:42:59.629 --> 01:42:59.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing uh we are in fact a
 
01:43:01.149 --> 01:43:01.159 align:start position:0%
governmental entity we're an
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
instrumentality of state government
 
01:43:05.709 --> 01:43:05.719 align:start position:0%
created by the legislature under RSA
 
01:43:07.870 --> 01:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
204c uh back in
 
01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:10.360 align:start position:0%
1981 uh regarding the term of
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
affordability it's not specific in RSA
 
01:43:16.589 --> 01:43:16.599 align:start position:0%
204d which is the statute referenced I
 
01:43:17.669 --> 01:43:17.679 align:start position:0%
believe in the amendment although I've
 
01:43:20.669 --> 01:43:20.679 align:start position:0%
have not seen the amendment itself um
 
01:43:23.189 --> 01:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
that is the The Sur Surplus lands
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
statute that pertains to affordable
 
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
housing that does not contain a a term
 
01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:28.830 align:start position:0%
housing that does not contain a a term
of

01:43:28.830 --> 01:43:28.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative yes on on lines uh End of
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
Line nine and line 10 is the reference
 
01:43:42.669 --> 01:43:42.679 align:start position:0%
to RSA 204d that does not contain a term
 
01:43:46.189 --> 01:43:46.199 align:start position:0%
of affordability U but generally the
 
01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
projects that we Finance we don't build
 
01:43:50.669 --> 01:43:50.679 align:start position:0%
the housing but we Finance developer
 
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
construction uh have terms that are at a
 
01:43:55.470 --> 01:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
minimum of 20 years but typically are
 
01:43:57.870 --> 01:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
more like 30
 
01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:08.910 --> 01:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
affordability representative Simon thank
 
01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you for taking my question
 
01:44:12.990 --> 01:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
so what what's the determining Factor as
 
01:44:16.030 --> 01:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
to whether it's 20 30 40 77 like how do
 
01:44:18.189 --> 01:44:18.199 align:start position:0%
you make those distinctions between
 
01:44:20.030 --> 01:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
applicants thank you for the question
 
01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
the the answer depends on the other
 
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
sources of funding so for example uh if
 
01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
we were to use the state's affordable
 
01:44:29.149 --> 01:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
housing fund that has a statutory
 
01:44:31.589 --> 01:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
minimum term of affordability of 20
 
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
years um if we were to use the uh
 
01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
low-income housing tax credit which is a
 
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
federal program that we administer uh
 
01:44:42.510 --> 01:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
that tends to be a minimum of 30 years
 
01:44:45.870 --> 01:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
although we push that to 40 and 60 years
 
01:44:47.669 --> 01:44:47.679 align:start position:0%
depending upon the type of tax credit
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
used uh we're now giving incent we we we
 
01:44:52.589 --> 01:44:52.599 align:start position:0%
will be giving incentives to developers
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
in the next next round to push that up
 
01:44:58.990 --> 01:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
to 75 years um it it these are typically
 
01:45:01.870 --> 01:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
um financially complex transactions that
 
01:45:04.510 --> 01:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
have a deep Capital stack many different
 
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
sources of funding and whichever one has
 
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
the longest term of affordability is the
 
01:45:11.950 --> 01:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
controls other do are there any other
 
01:45:16.709 --> 01:45:16.719 align:start position:0%
immediate questions for Mr Frost before
 
01:45:18.550 --> 01:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
we let them
 
01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:20.669 align:start position:0%
we let them
go

01:45:20.669 --> 01:45:20.679 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:45:23.790 --> 01:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
back so this might help a the concerns
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
of of the of some of the members of the
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
committee if the um if this property is
 
01:45:35.589 --> 01:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
used for affordable housing is there a
 
01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
restriction that the you know after the
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
the property cannot be sold for profit
 
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
by the organization after a certain
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
amount of time is there restriction of
 
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
what they can do with the property so
 
01:45:52.149 --> 01:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
that the concern is obviously that they
 
01:45:54.510 --> 01:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
buy it for a low price and then they
 
01:45:56.790 --> 01:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
sell it for a high price and walk you
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
know so is is there how can we alleviate
 
01:46:00.639 --> 01:46:01.510 align:start position:0%
know so is is there how can we alleviate
that

01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:03.390 --> 01:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
concern thank you for that question
 
01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
representative the I think the best
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
answer I can give is that we uh
 
01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
maintain um control over the operations
 
01:46:15.390 --> 01:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
of these properties we don't we don't
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
administer them directly but we oversee
 
01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
them on behalf of and in collaboration
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
with other investors uh so typically
 
01:46:27.669 --> 01:46:27.679 align:start position:0%
speaking these are uh
 
01:46:30.990 --> 01:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
for-profit um developments even when
 
01:46:34.030 --> 01:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
they're done by a nonprofit entity and
 
01:46:36.030 --> 01:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
this this relies on a provision of the
 
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
low-income housing tax credit which
 
01:46:40.510 --> 01:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
requires the development to be owned by
 
01:46:42.750 --> 01:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
a for-profit entity even if it's a
 
01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
nonprofit that's behind it and that's
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
just an aspect of federal law uh so
 
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
these do these do make profit but we
 
01:46:53.470 --> 01:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
require them uh in most cases to turn if
 
01:46:56.589 --> 01:46:56.599 align:start position:0%
they spin off cash we require 50% of
 
01:46:58.629 --> 01:46:58.639 align:start position:0%
that to come back to us which we then
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
reinvest in other properties um but we
 
01:47:04.910 --> 01:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
maintain long-term Asset Management as
 
01:47:07.870 --> 01:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
long as we have uh an interest in the
 
01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
property for those terms as I earlier
 
01:47:13.189 --> 01:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
described uh we are overseeing it and
 
01:47:17.870 --> 01:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
that means uh deeded uh deed restricted
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh conditions that are recorded in the
 
01:47:20.709 --> 01:47:20.719 align:start position:0%
registry of
 
01:47:25.629 --> 01:47:25.639 align:start position:0%
deeds okay represent Brown and the M py
 
01:47:27.310 --> 01:47:27.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair uh thanks for
 
01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question I can't find it in my
 
01:47:32.510 --> 01:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
notes and I can't remember can you
 
01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
refresh my memory on on why that the
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
Housing Authority wouldn't want to take
 
01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:45.070 --> 01:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
to well I'm uh it's an interesting
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
question and I'm I'm my comments on this
 
01:47:50.350 --> 01:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
at the hearing and here are in response
 
01:47:54.589 --> 01:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
to the bill um we do have existing tools
 
01:47:58.830 --> 01:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
under RSA 204d and other statutes to do
 
01:48:03.310 --> 01:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
similar things uh this is um I'd say
 
01:48:06.750 --> 01:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
helpful language that is intended I
 
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
think to guide state agency action and
 
01:48:14.669 --> 01:48:14.679 align:start position:0%
uh long range and GNC as
 
01:48:18.790 --> 01:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
well repr man py thank you madam chair
 
01:48:23.550 --> 01:48:23.560 align:start position:0%
um isn't this the way of
 
01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:28.639 align:start position:0%
uh Surplus property or uh not uh tax uh
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue generating property is
 
01:48:34.229 --> 01:48:34.239 align:start position:0%
redeveloped and over a period of time
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
that would uh generate
 
01:48:42.430 --> 01:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
taxes uh for the local community so this
 
01:48:46.910 --> 01:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
transforming non tax generating property
 
01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
into uh tax generating
 
01:48:52.910 --> 01:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
property that's very correct representa
 
01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:55.639 align:start position:0%
magy the almost all of the developments
 
01:48:59.189 --> 01:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
that we Finance are uh taxable uh
 
01:49:01.350 --> 01:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
properties so they pay local property
 
01:49:03.870 --> 01:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
tax including the State education
 
01:49:05.870 --> 01:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
so I I want to confirm something I
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
remember from the hearing that you
 
01:49:16.109 --> 01:49:16.119 align:start position:0%
already have have a priority in the
 
01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
purchase of such Surplus land but you
 
01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
must pay full
 
01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
price Madam chair it depends on who the
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
controlling agency is and the source of
 
01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
funding for the state agency to have
 
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
acquired the property uh under RSA
 
01:49:39.229 --> 01:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
204d uh we do have uh priority uh access
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
to it essentially a right of first
 
01:49:44.830 --> 01:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
refusal to any state agency property uh
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
and we under that statute we can acquire
 
01:49:50.430 --> 01:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
those properties uh I think the the
 
01:49:53.229 --> 01:49:53.239 align:start position:0%
language of the statute is with without
 
01:49:56.430 --> 01:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
consideration meaning without the fee
 
01:49:58.430 --> 01:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
being paid for the value of the land so
 
01:50:00.870 --> 01:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
we can under that statute acquire
 
01:50:03.990 --> 01:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
properties uh without paying for them
 
01:50:07.669 --> 01:50:07.679 align:start position:0%
subject to long range n&amp;c that they're
 
01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
they're the ultimate Arbiters of this
 
01:50:12.390 --> 01:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
that's the existing statute so this the
 
01:50:16.109 --> 01:50:16.119 align:start position:0%
existing statute says that you that you
 
01:50:19.589 --> 01:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
can be given a chunk of surplus land
 
01:50:21.709 --> 01:50:21.719 align:start position:0%
with the consent of the agency that owns
 
01:50:24.669 --> 01:50:24.679 align:start position:0%
it and governor and counsel and long
 
01:50:28.350 --> 01:50:28.360 align:start position:0%
range yes and long range planning and
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
this bill simply says if there's other
 
01:50:30.239 --> 01:50:31.790 align:start position:0%
this bill simply says if there's other
Surplus

01:50:31.790 --> 01:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
Surplus
 
01:50:35.070 --> 01:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
property you can get it for below
 
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
Market correct so it expands your
 
01:50:40.109 --> 01:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
options it does all right and I would
 
01:50:41.950 --> 01:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
say specifically with regard to the
 
01:50:44.589 --> 01:50:44.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation that's
 
01:50:46.910 --> 01:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
that's who owns a large portion of the
 
01:50:49.149 --> 01:50:49.159 align:start position:0%
Surplus type land in the state as I
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
would imagine representative leus and
 
01:50:52.990 --> 01:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
then Simon thank you it's just trying to
 
01:50:55.390 --> 01:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
get some clarification on on what was
 
01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
just asked
 
01:50:59.950 --> 01:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
so um there was a reference to
 
01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
Department transportation are they not
 
01:51:05.550 --> 01:51:05.560 align:start position:0%
an agency that you can acquire Surplus
 
01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
land from for no fee um I guess the
 
01:51:13.069 --> 01:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
question is why would you want this if
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
you can just take the land without any
 
01:51:18.910 --> 01:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
cost representative like I said it gets
 
01:51:22.030 --> 01:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
to the the point I I made um in the my
 
01:51:24.669 --> 01:51:24.679 align:start position:0%
prior response um and I didn't fully
 
01:51:27.709 --> 01:51:27.719 align:start position:0%
answer the the question I think um with
 
01:51:28.910 --> 01:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
regard to the Department of
 
01:51:31.470 --> 01:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
Transportation it does depend upon the
 
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
source that the the dot used to acquire
 
01:51:37.790 --> 01:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
the property on behalf of the State uh
 
01:51:41.229 --> 01:51:41.239 align:start position:0%
so if it is federal funding then under
 
01:51:44.270 --> 01:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
current federal law subject to waivers
 
01:51:46.669 --> 01:51:46.679 align:start position:0%
uh then the current fair market value
 
01:51:50.109 --> 01:51:50.119 align:start position:0%
must be obtained if it is highway or
 
01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
Turnpike funds um I believe it is
 
01:51:56.790 --> 01:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh the original purchase price and then
 
01:51:59.270 --> 01:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
there may be other other ways too but
 
01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
this this really gives some flexibility
 
01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
to dot in particular in uh determining
 
01:52:08.510 --> 01:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
that how they want to dispose of the
 
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
properties yeah I just looked at RSA 204
 
01:52:15.030 --> 01:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
and it says Surplus property with
 
01:52:18.589 --> 01:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
Highway fund shall be transferred to the
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
authority provided the authority shall
 
01:52:22.870 --> 01:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
compensate the department for such land
 
01:52:24.589 --> 01:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
and an amount acceptable to the
 
01:52:24.599 --> 01:52:26.229 align:start position:0%
and an amount acceptable to the
department

01:52:26.229 --> 01:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
so so the idea that current Law requires
 
01:52:33.950 --> 01:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
you to pay full market value is not
 
01:52:37.470 --> 01:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
exactly correct okay followup followup
 
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
please so I the second part of my
 
01:52:42.510 --> 01:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
question was um and I sort of got an
 
01:52:45.030 --> 01:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
answer but I'm not entirely clear on it
 
01:52:47.069 --> 01:52:47.079 align:start position:0%
is um you know what's the advantage to
 
01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
your agency of having this rather than
 
01:52:52.870 --> 01:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
just what you have today IDE and when
 
01:52:54.430 --> 01:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
you say flexibility I'd like a little
 
01:52:58.430 --> 01:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
expansion on that and uh the chair cited
 
01:53:01.229 --> 01:53:01.239 align:start position:0%
um RSA 204d I think you also need to
 
01:53:04.990 --> 01:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
look at um RSA 440 and I think there's
 
01:53:07.950 --> 01:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
another statute maybe
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
439 uh and that there's a series of
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
statutes under 4339 ABC and I forget
 
01:53:16.629 --> 01:53:16.639 align:start position:0%
which one is which uh but there
 
01:53:19.750 --> 01:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
different terms that apply um different
 
01:53:21.390 --> 01:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
requirements that apply depending upon
 
01:53:24.629 --> 01:53:24.639 align:start position:0%
the the s source of funding that dot
 
01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
used to acquire uh those properties this
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
would uh impact upon those whereas we to
 
01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
give us well to give the agency uh
 
01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
greater flexibility and I would suggest
 
01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
guidance to um long range and and GNC
 
01:53:45.510 --> 01:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
that it's within statutory authority to
 
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
do this thank
 
01:53:51.310 --> 01:53:51.320 align:start position:0%
you representative Schmidt and then gold
 
01:53:52.990 --> 01:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so
 
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
Ben can you tell us is this is this a
 
01:53:57.550 --> 01:53:57.560 align:start position:0%
situation that's happening all the time
 
01:54:01.629 --> 01:54:01.639 align:start position:0%
all over the place or is this a fairly
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
situation well representative Schmidt
 
01:54:12.910 --> 01:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's certainly Arcane but uh it is
 
01:54:15.870 --> 01:54:15.880 align:start position:0%
um becoming increasingly common uh in
 
01:54:18.229 --> 01:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
fact we are working with the Department
 
01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
of Transportation right now uh regarding
 
01:54:23.950 --> 01:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
properties in Conway that were
 
01:54:26.510 --> 01:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
associated with the now defunct Conway
 
01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:29.639 align:start position:0%
bypass project uh and this the
 
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
department is is disposing of those
 
01:54:33.950 --> 01:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
properties we are preparing to pay full
 
01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
fair market value for those we have uh
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
the department has an appraisal we have
 
01:54:39.950 --> 01:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
an appraisal we haven't agreed upon
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
price um and and that that simply means
 
01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
that it's a cost that's going to get
 
01:54:48.870 --> 01:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
embedded into the the transaction that
 
01:54:51.310 --> 01:54:51.320 align:start position:0%
when the uh properties are used for
 
01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
development so you it seems to be a more
 
01:54:57.830 --> 01:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mam chair so it seems to be
 
01:55:00.510 --> 01:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
something that is coming more into
 
01:55:03.310 --> 01:55:03.320 align:start position:0%
common practice uh
 
01:55:06.069 --> 01:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
or I think so yes and I I'll just say we
 
01:55:07.629 --> 01:55:07.639 align:start position:0%
have an excellent working relationship
 
01:55:09.510 --> 01:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Transportation
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
okay I think that's helpful thank you
 
01:55:13.669 --> 01:55:13.679 align:start position:0%
representative leus thank you so to to
 
01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
help me decide what I'm going to do um I
 
01:55:18.990 --> 01:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
do not
 
01:55:22.709 --> 01:55:22.719 align:start position:0%
support you know having umone money go
 
01:55:24.910 --> 01:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
into a program through any path other
 
01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
than the legislature you know explicitly
 
01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
providing it so the question is with
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
this bill will your agency be able
 
01:55:40.030 --> 01:55:40.040 align:start position:0%
to expand um you know the program where
 
01:55:41.950 --> 01:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
you can acquire property for this
 
01:55:44.669 --> 01:55:44.679 align:start position:0%
purpose for less than fair market value
 
01:55:47.950 --> 01:55:47.960 align:start position:0%
believe so okay thank you representative
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
gold thank you madam chair I have a
 
01:55:52.910 --> 01:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
two-part question the first part is
 
01:55:54.790 --> 01:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
if I remember correctly when the bill
 
01:55:56.189 --> 01:55:56.199 align:start position:0%
was originally
 
01:55:58.629 --> 01:55:58.639 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill was not your idea
 
01:56:00.270 --> 01:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
you didn't ask for this bill is that
 
01:56:02.470 --> 01:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct when you saw the
 
01:56:04.629 --> 01:56:04.639 align:start position:0%
bill you worked with the representative
 
01:56:07.550 --> 01:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
to um to work out some inconsistencies
 
01:56:09.669 --> 01:56:09.679 align:start position:0%
with other parts of the law that is
 
01:56:11.830 --> 01:56:11.840 align:start position:0%

looking at before you having worked on
 
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
the language of the representative to
 
01:56:31.270 --> 01:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
iron out some of that does this
 
01:56:34.870 --> 01:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
amendment F uh adjust any of the things

talking under fair market value what is
 
01:56:57.069 --> 01:56:57.079 align:start position:0%
the range of under fair market value
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
does that go all the way down to zero
 
01:57:01.870 --> 01:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
or okay so we're talking anywhere from
 
01:57:04.030 --> 01:57:04.040 align:start position:0%
zero to fair market value yes thank you

this kind of thing uh is disagreeable
 
02:06:09.030 --> 02:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
because it uh obscures costs for one so
 
02:06:11.069 --> 02:06:11.079 align:start position:0%
that will cause uh confusion for
 
02:06:13.149 --> 02:06:13.159 align:start position:0%
property values and pricing for the
 
02:06:15.870 --> 02:06:15.880 align:start position:0%

Department to another without uh going
 
02:06:29.069 --> 02:06:29.079 align:start position:0%
through the legislator and kind of OB
 
02:06:31.109 --> 02:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
scures the funding in that
 
02:06:31.119 --> 02:06:34.589 align:start position:0%

this bill deals with firefighter station
 
02:08:56.750 --> 02:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
where or not to be confused with their
 
02:08:58.229 --> 02:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
personal protective equipment which is
 
02:09:00.189 --> 02:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
what they would use in an actual um
 
02:09:02.990 --> 02:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
dangerous fire situation um station wear
 
02:09:05.109 --> 02:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
is defined for the first time in statute
 
02:09:06.549 --> 02:09:06.559 align:start position:0%
to differentiate it from personal
 
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
protective equipment so you can see that
 
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
on line 12 um there um further changes
 
02:09:15.549 --> 02:09:15.559 align:start position:0%
the the amendment brings down on line
 
02:09:15.559 --> 02:09:18.109 align:start position:0%
the the amendment brings down on line
27

02:09:18.109 --> 02:09:18.119 align:start position:0%
27
 
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
um the uh manufacturers have to um be
 
02:09:25.189 --> 02:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
transparent as to whether or not the um
 
02:09:27.470 --> 02:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
firefighter station wear contains past
 
02:09:31.950 --> 02:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
chemicals um and those notices um on 30
 
02:09:33.390 --> 02:09:33.400 align:start position:0%
line 30 says all notices shall be
 
02:09:35.709 --> 02:09:35.719 align:start position:0%
included in all personal Personnel files
 
02:09:37.229 --> 02:09:37.239 align:start position:0%
while employees using the firefighting
 
02:09:39.069 --> 02:09:39.079 align:start position:0%
protective personal protective equipment
 
02:09:41.109 --> 02:09:41.119 align:start position:0%
and a copy of the same shall be provided
 
02:09:43.030 --> 02:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
directly to the employee so the employee
 
02:09:44.549 --> 02:09:44.559 align:start position:0%
the employee has a record of whether or
 
02:09:46.149 --> 02:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
not even the protective equipment that
 
02:09:49.830 --> 02:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
they're using um has pasas in it um the
 
02:09:52.430 --> 02:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
main change uh
 
02:09:55.790 --> 02:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
is uh page two line nine and following
 
02:09:57.229 --> 02:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
uh it says should safe alternative to
 
02:09:58.549 --> 02:09:58.559 align:start position:0%
the current firefighter personal
 
02:09:59.830 --> 02:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
protective equipment be designed and
 
02:10:02.030 --> 02:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
manufactured fire departments may give
 
02:10:03.629 --> 02:10:03.639 align:start position:0%
preference to that alternative as a part
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
of their existing personel protective
 
02:10:06.950 --> 02:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
equipment replacement program and then
 
02:10:09.629 --> 02:10:09.639 align:start position:0%
from 12 on talks about um a safe
 
02:10:09.639 --> 02:10:11.589 align:start position:0%
from 12 on talks about um a safe
alternative

02:10:11.589 --> 02:10:11.599 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
02:10:15.790 --> 02:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
um or sorry uh line 17 talks about the
 
02:10:18.870 --> 02:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
station where uh This was um to address
 
02:10:21.709 --> 02:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
representative Le's concern um um that
 
02:10:24.270 --> 02:10:24.280 align:start position:0%
we're not um pushing an unfunded mandate
 
02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
down um on the municipalities it gives
 
02:10:32.069 --> 02:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
time um beginning in January 1st of 2025
 
02:10:34.629 --> 02:10:34.639 align:start position:0%
uh for departments to cease um the
 
02:10:37.470 --> 02:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
purchasing of that Fireware and then on
 
02:10:40.510 --> 02:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
July 1st uh for the wearing of the same
 
02:10:42.790 --> 02:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
um and that will allow uh the funds that
 
02:10:44.430 --> 02:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
usually come for their allowance to come
 
02:10:45.709 --> 02:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
through before they have to make those
 
02:10:48.149 --> 02:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
purchases so that it's not um difficult
 
02:10:49.669 --> 02:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
for the municipalities or for the
 
02:10:51.470 --> 02:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
firefighter themselves so that's
 
02:10:52.950 --> 02:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
essentially what the amendment does and
 
02:10:54.430 --> 02:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
once again the subcommittee looked at
 
02:10:55.589 --> 02:10:55.599 align:start position:0%
that thought it was reasonable and is
 
02:10:56.709 --> 02:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
recommending it to the committee as
 
02:10:57.990 --> 02:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
ought to
 
02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
pass represent gr do you wish to speak
 
02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
to your
 
02:11:07.629 --> 02:11:07.639 align:start position:0%
second yes I um I think that the bill
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:11:13.589 --> 02:11:13.599 align:start position:0%
itself uh defines better the um the
 
02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill however I do have a
 
02:11:20.549 --> 02:11:20.559 align:start position:0%
question about this with representative
 
02:11:20.559 --> 02:11:22.830 align:start position:0%
question about this with representative
Simon

02:11:22.830 --> 02:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
Simon
 
02:11:25.870 --> 02:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about in paragraph six
 
02:11:27.990 --> 02:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about station Weare which
 
02:11:30.390 --> 02:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
I don't have a problem with that but in
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph five we're talking about
 
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:45.310 --> 02:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
so I would how do we know that this
 
02:11:48.790 --> 02:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
firefighting Personnel protective
 
02:11:51.750 --> 02:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
equipment is approved by someone
 
02:11:53.310 --> 02:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
is approved
 
02:11:57.030 --> 02:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
by as approved by because you can you
 
02:12:00.229 --> 02:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
know for example um one of the reasons
 
02:12:03.910 --> 02:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
why these materials are used in fire
 
02:12:06.589 --> 02:12:06.599 align:start position:0%
firing protective equipment is they
 
02:12:11.030 --> 02:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
incredible tolerance to high heat and so
 
02:12:12.910 --> 02:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
how do we make
 
02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:14.549 align:start position:0%
how do we make
sure

02:12:14.549 --> 02:12:14.559 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:12:18.629 --> 02:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
that this equipment when you
 
02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
say they shall be given preference
 
02:12:23.430 --> 02:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
a safe
 
02:12:25.910 --> 02:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
alternative how do we Define this I just
 
02:12:28.350 --> 02:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that someone doesn't
 
02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
buy something that is considered safe
 
02:12:34.109 --> 02:12:34.119 align:start position:0%
alternative and is less expensive and
 
02:12:36.069 --> 02:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
isn't protecting our firefighters I mean
 
02:12:37.950 --> 02:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
anybody can jump in on this conversation
 
02:12:39.470 --> 02:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
because that's what concerns me I'll let
 
02:12:42.149 --> 02:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
represent go hit it first and follow up
 
02:12:43.270 --> 02:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair there are
 
02:12:45.669 --> 02:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
standards for which gear are certified
 
02:12:47.350 --> 02:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
and made
 
02:12:50.229 --> 02:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
acceptable for the turnout gear um and
 
02:12:51.750 --> 02:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
that's what they would have to be using
 
02:12:54.189 --> 02:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
when they set the standard they'd have
 
02:12:55.470 --> 02:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
to follow those standards that are
 
02:12:58.149 --> 02:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
already in place okay for the
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
gar standards are in statute not in
 
02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
statute they're NFPA compliance okay all
 
02:13:07.069 --> 02:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
right they in the fire code I support
 
02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment and I um that was my only
 
02:13:11.270 --> 02:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
concern but I do think that the bill
 
02:13:13.470 --> 02:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
defines better the intent and I
 
02:13:15.149 --> 02:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate the work thank you you're
 
02:13:16.750 --> 02:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
welcome and just to clarify too uh the
 
02:13:19.109 --> 02:13:19.119 align:start position:0%
bill also the amendment also States I
 
02:13:22.709 --> 02:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
think both of them did um that they're
 
02:13:24.350 --> 02:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
going to you know they shouldn't be
 
02:13:26.830 --> 02:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
wearing that except when necessary but
 
02:13:27.950 --> 02:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
obviously they still need to do it when
 
02:13:29.390 --> 02:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
it's necessary but when they're out just
 
02:13:31.030 --> 02:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
on a call that where they're not in
 
02:13:32.589 --> 02:13:32.599 align:start position:0%
danger they shouldn't be wearing that
 
02:13:34.589 --> 02:13:34.599 align:start position:0%
equipment because it's being proven to
 
02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
cause cancer so we we don't want
 
02:13:42.109 --> 02:13:42.119 align:start position:0%
that represent representative Schmid
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman we worked on
 
02:13:47.229 --> 02:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
this in subcommittee a lot uh and I I
 
02:13:51.149 --> 02:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
was at the W ugas Hospital C cafeteria a
 
02:13:52.669 --> 02:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks ago and somebody
 
02:13:56.030 --> 02:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
inadvertently triggered off a uh fire
 
02:13:58.830 --> 02:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
alarm Okay and the the trucks we had
 
02:14:00.990 --> 02:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
trucks from Dover and from Summers where
 
02:14:03.669 --> 02:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
all came there was no fire but it was
 
02:14:06.149 --> 02:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
interesting to see when they pulled up
 
02:14:09.069 --> 02:14:09.079 align:start position:0%
see them getting out of the uh of their
 
02:14:11.870 --> 02:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
truck and putting on their equipment
 
02:14:14.270 --> 02:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
because you know they're not supposed to
 
02:14:17.149 --> 02:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
wear it except when they're going in and
 
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's essential to protect them in
 
02:14:24.030 --> 02:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
in an actual fire uh but otherwise they
 
02:14:26.470 --> 02:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
don't want it on at all because it is
 
02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:28.549 align:start position:0%
don't want it on at all because it is
dangerous

02:14:28.549 --> 02:14:28.559 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
02:14:31.510 --> 02:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
okay so I called out to him saying there
 
02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
ain't no fire guys take your time and so
 
02:14:36.350 --> 02:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
forth but because otherwise they got to
 
02:14:38.189 --> 02:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
get get into their gear and put it all
 
02:14:40.030 --> 02:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
on and not wearing it when they're
 
02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:41.510 align:start position:0%
on and not wearing it when they're
driving

02:14:41.510 --> 02:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
driving
 
02:14:44.629 --> 02:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
around good representative Brown uh
 
02:14:46.510 --> 02:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh for
 
02:14:49.589 --> 02:14:49.599 align:start position:0%
representative Simon for clarify for me
 
02:14:51.549 --> 02:14:51.559 align:start position:0%
it is it the the chemicals that could be
 
02:14:54.310 --> 02:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
in the gear that can have been shown to
 
02:14:56.189 --> 02:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
cause cancer in certain circumstances
 
02:14:58.589 --> 02:14:58.599 align:start position:0%
not the gear itself that's not
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily is that necessarily proven
 
02:15:03.310 --> 02:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
that the gear causes cancer um so
 
02:15:05.229 --> 02:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
there's at least a a very strong concern
 
02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
and correlation with the fact that the
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
past chemicals that they're presently
 
02:15:11.189 --> 02:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
using as fire retardants in the gear um
 
02:15:12.830 --> 02:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
is cancer causing because obviously when
 
02:15:14.750 --> 02:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
they're in high heat and sweating pores
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
open up and you know there's a lot of
 
02:15:17.790 --> 02:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
transfer between the chemicals and the
 
02:15:20.069 --> 02:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
bloodstream um so we want to be cautious
 
02:15:22.709 --> 02:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
of that this this bill in particular for
 
02:15:24.350 --> 02:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
the most part is work uh dealing with
 
02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
station wear station wear could be
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
t-shirts and you know pants or whatever
 
02:15:29.430 --> 02:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
um stuff that they're just wearing
 
02:15:31.510 --> 02:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
around the station and whatnot those
 
02:15:34.549 --> 02:15:34.559 align:start position:0%
also have been Laden with past chemicals
 
02:15:36.589 --> 02:15:36.599 align:start position:0%
um I think to just kind of consider it
 
02:15:38.669 --> 02:15:38.679 align:start position:0%
as an extra layer of protection in case
 
02:15:40.390 --> 02:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
they're not necessary I I did ask
 
02:15:42.629 --> 02:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
whether or not it puts the firefighters
 
02:15:44.589 --> 02:15:44.599 align:start position:0%
a greater risk to wear that under their
 
02:15:47.310 --> 02:15:47.320 align:start position:0%
protective equipment and it does not um
 
02:15:49.430 --> 02:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
so that's just to say this the regular
 
02:15:50.430 --> 02:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
wear that they're wearing around the
 
02:15:52.589 --> 02:15:52.599 align:start position:0%
station should have this stuff in it um
 
02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
because they shouldn't be soaking in it
 
02:15:56.790 --> 02:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
all the time yeah if anyone is
 
02:15:59.870 --> 02:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
interested the uh Globe Manufacturing in
 
02:16:03.350 --> 02:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield makes most of this equipment
 
02:16:05.870 --> 02:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
and it's it's not just one layer it's
 
02:16:08.109 --> 02:16:08.119 align:start position:0%
multiples and if you're interested we
 
02:16:09.589 --> 02:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
can arrange for a
 
02:16:12.350 --> 02:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
tour representative Gould and then Shu
 
02:16:15.589 --> 02:16:15.599 align:start position:0%
it Madam chair just like to say again I
 
02:16:17.629 --> 02:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
think I've said this before but the
 
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
conversations with this committee's
 
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
having and the testimony we heard have
 
02:16:24.030 --> 02:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
spread out through so many networks kind
 
02:16:25.549 --> 02:16:25.559 align:start position:0%
of backing up what representative
 
02:16:27.950 --> 02:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
Schmidt said I know that volunteer
 
02:16:30.950 --> 02:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
firefighters in my district are no
 
02:16:33.990 --> 02:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
longer carrying pfast 3D gear in their
 
02:16:35.750 --> 02:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
pickup truck riding around with it all
 
02:16:37.429 --> 02:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
the time as a result of what we've
 
02:16:39.830 --> 02:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
learned so thank you and I support well
 
02:16:42.070 --> 02:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
that's very good representative Shu the
 
02:16:45.509 --> 02:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
beny thank you madam chair yes um I just
 
02:16:47.270 --> 02:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
want to point out and I I think we're
 
02:16:50.549 --> 02:16:50.559 align:start position:0%
all aware that uh firefighting gear has
 
02:16:53.910 --> 02:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
Chang changed and adapted over the I'll
 
02:16:57.230 --> 02:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
say centuries technically uh as new
 
02:16:59.830 --> 02:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
technologies come out that they think
 
02:17:02.030 --> 02:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
will protect firefighters they're
 
02:17:05.270 --> 02:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
adapted but unfortunately it sometimes
 
02:17:09.429 --> 02:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
takes time and use to discover that some
 
02:17:12.349 --> 02:17:12.359 align:start position:0%
of the materials are in fact uh
 
02:17:14.429 --> 02:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the health of the the
 
02:17:16.469 --> 02:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
very people that they're designed to
 
02:17:19.950 --> 02:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
protect so any step forward that we can
 
02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
take to try in advance that uh I think
 
02:17:26.030 --> 02:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
is in the right direction okay represent
 
02:17:28.870 --> 02:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
mani and then Schmid U thank you madam
 
02:17:32.709 --> 02:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
chair um echoing some of the comments
 
02:17:39.030 --> 02:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
earlier uh also realizing that PF uh p
 
02:17:41.830 --> 02:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
is not only in the gear but also in the
 
02:17:44.349 --> 02:17:44.359 align:start position:0%
insulation and stuff so from different
 
02:17:48.309 --> 02:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
angles this is helping the
 
02:17:51.270 --> 02:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
firefighters um First Responders going
 
02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
into these fire to reduce the risk of
 
02:17:58.830 --> 02:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
exposure in this personal gear my son is
 
02:18:02.349 --> 02:18:02.359 align:start position:0%
a volunteer firefighter in Vermont and
 
02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
this was very specific to asking the
 
02:18:13.190 --> 02:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:21.429 --> 02:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
um uh cated uh pced uh um
 
02:18:26.070 --> 02:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
clothing sorry and this was also um
 
02:18:29.709 --> 02:18:29.719 align:start position:0%
initially it was also in the kids babies
 
02:18:33.509 --> 02:18:33.519 align:start position:0%
the um what is it the pajamas and stuff
 
02:18:36.750 --> 02:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
so this was uh you know but now a lot of
 
02:18:38.429 --> 02:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
those things are retreating and I think
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
we are doing the right thing to protect
 
02:18:42.270 --> 02:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
our fire
 
02:18:44.990 --> 02:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
fighters representative Smith thank you
 
02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
you recall those of us who've been
 
02:18:48.150 --> 02:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
around for a while we had the
 
02:18:51.230 --> 02:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
firefighting Foams the bill about 6 or 7
 
02:18:54.429 --> 02:18:54.439 align:start position:0%
years ago they stuff used to be they
 
02:18:56.830 --> 02:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
would the firefighters used to sometimes
 
02:19:00.150 --> 02:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
use it in their graduation ceremonies
 
02:19:02.030 --> 02:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
you know spraying it around dunking it
 
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
and so forth and so on and stuff turns
 
02:19:06.750 --> 02:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
out to be extremely toxic and so forth
 
02:19:09.549 --> 02:19:09.559 align:start position:0%
and so on much of that stuff has been
 
02:19:13.709 --> 02:19:13.719 align:start position:0%
replaced by less harmful substances but
 
02:19:16.750 --> 02:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
if you want to get true
 
02:19:19.389 --> 02:19:19.399 align:start position:0%
protection you got to use it but you
 
02:19:21.589 --> 02:19:21.599 align:start position:0%
don't want to be using it it except when
 
02:19:24.030 --> 02:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary to go into an
 
02:19:26.349 --> 02:19:26.359 align:start position:0%
incident so this is what we're talking
 
02:19:29.990 --> 02:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
about here okay yes represent gold one
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
last comment as a Shepherd I would be
 
02:19:34.589 --> 02:19:34.599 align:start position:0%
remissed to not say there's some really
 
02:19:36.910 --> 02:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
exciting research happening with wool
 
02:19:39.910 --> 02:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
which is an old material but it can
 
02:19:43.270 --> 02:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
provide Protections in a non-toxic
 
02:19:47.349 --> 02:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:49.910 --> 02:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
Brown um thank you everyone for that let
 
02:19:52.349 --> 02:19:52.359 align:start position:0%
let me try to explain what I asked
 
02:19:54.469 --> 02:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
representative Simon so because it seems
 
02:19:56.309 --> 02:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
like some of you are concerned to what I
 
02:19:58.349 --> 02:19:58.359 align:start position:0%
asked you go to the gas station there's
 
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
benzine and gasoline Benzene is a known
 
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
carcinogen but if you get a drop of
 
02:20:04.710 --> 02:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
gasoline on your finger you don't get
 
02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
cancer on your finger is my point so
 
02:20:08.790 --> 02:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
that that was kind of what I was asking
 
02:20:11.349 --> 02:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
thank you yes
 
02:20:15.030 --> 02:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
they're over time these protective gear
 
02:20:17.950 --> 02:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
has become less immediately toxic but
 
02:20:19.990 --> 02:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's still carcinogenic in
 
02:20:22.710 --> 02:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
still beats getting
 
02:20:29.150 --> 02:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
burnt all right anyone else comments all
 
02:20:31.630 --> 02:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
right the motion is to adopt amendment
 
02:20:35.110 --> 02:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
0981 to House Bill 1352 and the clerk
 
02:20:37.910 --> 02:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
can call the role representative Simon
 
02:20:39.670 --> 02:20:39.680 align:start position:0%

Manti yes and the chair yes onea z n all
 
02:21:21.309 --> 02:21:21.319 align:start position:0%
right is the amendment passes
 
02:21:23.710 --> 02:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
go thank you madam chair I move on to
 
02:21:26.790 --> 02:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
pass with am as amended with Amendment
 
02:21:29.230 --> 02:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
okay seconded by representative Simon
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
moved by representative goalie ought to
 
02:21:32.230 --> 02:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
pass with
 
02:21:37.830 --> 02:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:40.790 --> 02:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
motion yes
 
02:21:42.830 --> 02:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
um as a
 
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
retired Captain with me just um I
 
02:21:49.030 --> 02:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
understand the importance of turnout
 
02:21:51.750 --> 02:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
gear and the protection it provides
 
02:21:54.630 --> 02:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
also understand that in wearing that
 
02:21:57.510 --> 02:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
turnout gear it also can be detrimental
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
to the health of some of the uh
 
02:22:01.150 --> 02:22:01.160 align:start position:0%
individuals it's meant to
 
02:22:06.070 --> 02:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
protect um so this is a big step in the
 
02:22:09.349 --> 02:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
right direction to make sure that our
 
02:22:09.359 --> 02:22:10.790 align:start position:0%

original Bill the fees were going to be

boards and established by the office the
 
02:26:32.190 --> 02:26:32.200 align:start position:0%

02:30:24.349 --> 02:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
present amendment number
 
02:30:29.349 --> 02:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:33.070 --> 02:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
second so I'll mention that we heard
 
02:30:35.750 --> 02:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
that there were problems the no the
 
02:30:39.190 --> 02:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
original Bill simply
 
02:30:42.590 --> 02:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
added clinics outpatient clinics to the
 
02:30:45.710 --> 02:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
list of organizations that don't that
 
02:30:48.950 --> 02:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
can employ unlicensed individuals for
 
02:30:51.670 --> 02:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
mental health practice
 
02:30:54.830 --> 02:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
after discussion in the subcommittee we
 
02:30:59.030 --> 02:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
decided it wasn't really the
 
02:31:00.830 --> 02:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
organization of
 
02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
the agency that was doing it it was how
 
02:31:05.349 --> 02:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
it would you know whether it's
 
02:31:09.110 --> 02:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
for-profit or not for profit it's that
 
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's an organization that provides
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
services and provides clinical
 
02:31:17.150 --> 02:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
supervision of its
 
02:31:21.950 --> 02:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
staff so this Amendment instead of
 
02:31:25.190 --> 02:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
adding to the list of Exempted
 
02:31:28.269 --> 02:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
institutions Etc it says that the
 
02:31:31.590 --> 02:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
organization provides clinical Mental
 
02:31:35.070 --> 02:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
Health Services employs licensed
 
02:31:37.870 --> 02:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
practitioners who can do the supervision
 
02:31:40.469 --> 02:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
and provides clinical supervision and
 
02:31:42.950 --> 02:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
assumes professional ethical and legal
 
02:31:44.950 --> 02:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility for those
 
02:31:51.070 --> 02:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
services so that is essentially what the
 
02:31:54.670 --> 02:31:54.680 align:start position:0%
facilities or institutions or nonprofits
 
02:31:57.070 --> 02:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
do this simply says we don't care if
 
02:31:59.630 --> 02:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
you're for-profit or not you have to do
 
02:32:02.349 --> 02:32:02.359 align:start position:0%
these things in order to be able to
 
02:32:02.359 --> 02:32:03.389 align:start position:0%
these things in order to be able to
bring

02:32:03.389 --> 02:32:03.399 align:start position:0%
bring
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
on unlicensed people people who are
 
02:32:09.349 --> 02:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
waiting for their license and so uh we
 
02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
think it will help with the problem of
 
02:32:15.910 --> 02:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
for-profit and not for profit agencies
 
02:32:18.830 --> 02:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
differently so representative

okay do you wish to speak to your motion
 
02:35:11.030 --> 02:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh yeah just real briefly um so all this
 
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
bill does uh is bring it in line with
 
02:35:15.030 --> 02:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
the language that we just had in the
 
02:35:17.990 --> 02:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
previous Amendment um in supervisory
 
02:35:20.429 --> 02:35:20.439 align:start position:0%
agreements that go outside of the
 
02:35:23.750 --> 02:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
realm of organization we on one-onone um
 
02:35:25.190 --> 02:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
it simply states that the supervisor
 
02:35:26.790 --> 02:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
shall assume professional ethical and
 
02:35:28.269 --> 02:35:28.279 align:start position:0%
legal responsibility for the mental
 
02:35:29.510 --> 02:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
health services provided by the
 
02:35:31.309 --> 02:35:31.319 align:start position:0%
candidate in a written agreement on
 
02:35:33.429 --> 02:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
record with the board there has been
 
02:35:35.630 --> 02:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
some concern that the previous language
 
02:35:37.710 --> 02:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
uh opened up the supervisor to legal
 
02:35:40.150 --> 02:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
ramifications beyond their professional
 
02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh engagement with um the candidate and
 
02:35:44.670 --> 02:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
so we just wanted to clarify the fact
 
02:35:46.469 --> 02:35:46.479 align:start position:0%
that they can only be held accountable
 
02:35:48.429 --> 02:35:48.439 align:start position:0%
um when the candidate is providing
 
02:35:53.230 --> 02:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:55.269 --> 02:35:55.279 align:start position:0%

gold okay do you wish to speak to your
 
02:39:12.910 --> 02:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
motion um in the subcommittee we spoke
 
02:39:16.110 --> 02:39:16.120 align:start position:0%
at at length about the the difference
 
02:39:20.990 --> 02:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
between these two um professions and
 
02:39:22.590 --> 02:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
that there would be some
 
02:39:25.110 --> 02:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
significant addition in time probably to
 
02:39:26.870 --> 02:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
the Board of Professional Engineers if
 
02:39:29.030 --> 02:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
these two boards were combined and it
 
02:39:30.790 --> 02:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
would probably be less efficient in the
 
02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:32.269 align:start position:0%
would probably be less efficient in the
long

02:39:32.269 --> 02:39:32.279 align:start position:0%
long
 
02:39:34.950 --> 02:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
run thank you representative gold my
 
02:39:38.710 --> 02:39:38.720 align:start position:0%

representative

02:39:39.910 --> 02:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:39:44.190 --> 02:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
laus um thank you um yeah we decided
 
02:39:45.950 --> 02:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
that that they are distinct enough that
 
02:39:48.030 --> 02:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
the land Ser surveyor serving on the
 
02:39:50.269 --> 02:39:50.279 align:start position:0%
board really couldn't help much with the
 
02:39:54.870 --> 02:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh um you know the engineers and with
 
02:39:56.510 --> 02:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
certain exception except for certain
 
02:39:58.190 --> 02:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
exceptions the uh Engineers weren't
 
02:39:59.269 --> 02:39:59.279 align:start position:0%
going to be able to come out on land
 
02:40:01.630 --> 02:40:01.640 align:start position:0%
surveying combining them didn't make
 
02:40:04.309 --> 02:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
sense in the future there are problems
 
02:40:06.110 --> 02:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
with the number of land Ser surveyor
 
02:40:08.469 --> 02:40:08.479 align:start position:0%
being small in the future it might make
 
02:40:10.030 --> 02:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
sense to turn that into an Advisory
 
02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
board but that's not the bill we had so
 
02:40:14.950 --> 02:40:14.960 align:start position:0%

representative Brown was going to go get
 
02:43:40.510 --> 02:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
a change to it it hasn't come through as
 
02:43:42.190 --> 02:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
far as I know so I have them it has not
 
02:43:43.990 --> 02:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I keep checking my email and it has
 
02:43:45.750 --> 02:43:45.760 align:start position:0%

02:43:47.910 --> 02:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
okay Madam cheer would you like me to
 
02:43:49.590 --> 02:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
talk about house buil tent oh we need to
 
02:43:52.150 --> 02:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
withdraw the Motions I guess right if or
 
02:43:53.670 --> 02:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
are we going to continue we don't have
 
02:43:56.750 --> 02:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:59.950 --> 02:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment so so the the amendment change
 
02:44:02.710 --> 02:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
is a um a minor detail that we can
 
02:44:04.510 --> 02:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
discuss that doesn't change the bill at
 
02:44:06.349 --> 02:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
all it's just a minor change to it so if
 
02:44:08.550 --> 02:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
we want to discuss it we can and then if
 
02:44:10.269 --> 02:44:10.279 align:start position:0%
you feel like it's too large of a change
 
02:44:11.950 --> 02:44:11.960 align:start position:0%
we can withdraw it but I think we can
 
02:44:15.070 --> 02:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
probably move forward I I don't have any
 
02:44:17.110 --> 02:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment for we don't have any of the
 
02:44:19.910 --> 02:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
Amendments oh he's got it
 
02:44:21.150 --> 02:44:21.160 align:start position:0%
I I'd already passed it the other side
 
02:44:22.550 --> 02:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
but I stopped
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%

yes the amendment that was stated to be
 
02:44:33.870 --> 02:44:33.880 align:start position:0%
offered was 1096 this is not so the
 
02:44:36.710 --> 02:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
motion needs to be withdrawn 10 yeah
 
02:44:39.190 --> 02:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
I'll remove my I'll remove my um motion
 
02:44:42.429 --> 02:44:42.439 align:start position:0%
to move uh amendment 10 n6h because that
 
02:44:44.349 --> 02:44:44.359 align:start position:0%

02:44:46.070 --> 02:44:46.080 align:start position:0%

seconds okay so just for clarification
 
02:45:05.110 --> 02:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
if we vote on this amendment but then we
 
02:45:06.790 --> 02:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
get another amendment it will have a
 
02:45:08.830 --> 02:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
different number so how do we handle
 
02:45:12.030 --> 02:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
that I just want to I think considering
 
02:45:14.550 --> 02:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
the time we will discuss this amendment
 
02:45:17.710 --> 02:45:17.720 align:start position:0%

02:45:20.230 --> 02:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
new Amendment we will have it back after
 
02:45:23.070 --> 02:45:23.080 align:start position:0%

02:46:04.950 --> 02:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh the intent of this bill
 
02:46:11.070 --> 02:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:13.349 --> 02:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
veterans cross over to the civilian
 
02:46:16.269 --> 02:46:16.279 align:start position:0%
world with licenses for whatever their
 
02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
profession might
 
02:46:20.550 --> 02:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
be in originally our thought as the
 
02:46:23.150 --> 02:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
sponsors it was a team effort that we
 
02:46:25.510 --> 02:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
could create a crosswalk and or a matrix
 
02:46:27.910 --> 02:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
for all of the military occupational
 
02:46:30.910 --> 02:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
Specialties over to civilian Specialties
 
02:46:33.630 --> 02:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
and we quickly realized that that was a
 
02:46:36.309 --> 02:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
a gantu and task and that none of us had
 
02:46:40.190 --> 02:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
the expertise to actually do that job
 
02:46:43.309 --> 02:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
I'm working closely with oplc and the
 
02:46:45.349 --> 02:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
deputy agitant General Warren Perry from
 
02:46:47.070 --> 02:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
the veterans
 
02:46:50.269 --> 02:46:50.279 align:start position:0%
agency we massage the original Bill and
 
02:46:51.830 --> 02:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
ended up with this amendment where we
 
02:46:55.870 --> 02:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
are at now it creates a program in in
 
02:46:57.790 --> 02:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
the veterans agency called the veterans
 
02:46:59.950 --> 02:46:59.960 align:start position:0%
licensing acceleration program which
 
02:47:04.030 --> 02:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
they will guide our veterans and uh uh
 
02:47:05.990 --> 02:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
those that may be still in the military
 
02:47:06.950 --> 02:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
but they know they're going to be
 
02:47:09.230 --> 02:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
getting out very shortly it will guide
 
02:47:12.510 --> 02:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
them through the process and help them
 
02:47:14.510 --> 02:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh to work with oplc to get their
 
02:47:15.990 --> 02:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
applications done
 
02:47:18.630 --> 02:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
properly and oplc will then be able to
 
02:47:20.110 --> 02:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
work for them to get their licensing
 
02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:21.469 align:start position:0%
work for them to get their licensing
done

02:47:21.469 --> 02:47:21.479 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:47:25.630 --> 02:47:25.640 align:start position:0%
efficiently there we do have a small
 
02:47:26.750 --> 02:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
concern that we're going to try to
 
02:47:28.910 --> 02:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
address in the Senate because we we
 
02:47:31.070 --> 02:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
brought I brought something up Friday
 
02:47:32.750 --> 02:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
that would involve other the other
 
02:47:37.150 --> 02:47:37.160 align:start position:0%
agencies whose boards are not under
 
02:47:39.910 --> 02:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
oplc and they would not have been aware
 
02:47:41.269 --> 02:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
of this amendment that we wanted to
 
02:47:41.279 --> 02:47:42.230 align:start position:0%
of this amendment that we wanted to
bring

02:47:42.230 --> 02:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
bring
 
02:47:45.030 --> 02:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
forward today so that will hopefully be
 
02:47:46.469 --> 02:47:46.479 align:start position:0%
taken care of in an amendment when we
 
02:47:49.710 --> 02:47:49.720 align:start position:0%
get to the Senate I think um
 
02:47:52.670 --> 02:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh the veterans agency and Deputy
 
02:47:55.830 --> 02:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
agitant General is is very much uh on
 
02:47:58.830 --> 02:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
board with this as as he has left I'm
 
02:48:01.790 --> 02:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
speaking for him is he still here no
 
02:48:04.590 --> 02:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
he's not here he was here earlier um and
 
02:48:07.150 --> 02:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
I think I that's probably enough um I'm
 
02:48:09.550 --> 02:48:09.560 align:start position:0%
sure that uh representative Simon or
 
02:48:11.230 --> 02:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
enals can chime in if you have any
 
02:48:13.230 --> 02:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
questions I'm happy to take the
 
02:48:16.630 --> 02:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
amendment that yes okay
 
02:48:19.269 --> 02:48:19.279 align:start position:0%
so the amendment that I took down if you
 
02:48:22.830 --> 02:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
go to page let's start on page
 
02:48:27.110 --> 02:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
two on line 15 on page
 
02:48:30.910 --> 02:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
two um under the SE existing section
 
02:48:33.110 --> 02:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
31016 military service members we're
 
02:48:34.389 --> 02:48:34.399 align:start position:0%
going to change that to spouse and
 
02:48:37.190 --> 02:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
Veterans that's fine Roman numeral one
 
02:48:38.950 --> 02:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
talks about the temporary
 
02:48:41.630 --> 02:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
licenses which the intent was if you're
 
02:48:43.190 --> 02:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
if you're a military person moving to
 
02:48:45.630 --> 02:48:45.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and your spouse has a
 
02:48:47.790 --> 02:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
license as you you probably move every 3
 
02:48:49.550 --> 02:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
years as a military person that your
 
02:48:51.950 --> 02:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
spouse can easily get a temporary
 
02:48:54.870 --> 02:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
license then it goes the addition is on
 
02:48:59.070 --> 02:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:02.070 --> 02:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
2 and it says uh I'll read it
 
02:49:03.670 --> 02:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding any journalist special
 
02:49:05.150 --> 02:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
law to the contrary the executive
 
02:49:07.110 --> 02:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
director s facilitate the issuance of a
 
02:49:10.389 --> 02:49:10.399 align:start position:0%
license or certification for a person
 
02:49:11.950 --> 02:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
and in that list
 
02:49:15.950 --> 02:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
ABCD veterans is not stated we had some
 
02:49:18.070 --> 02:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
discussion in the subcommittee that
 
02:49:20.429 --> 02:49:20.439 align:start position:0%
because it say veteran back on page two
 
02:49:24.389 --> 02:49:24.399 align:start position:0%
on line 15 that that would cover it but
 
02:49:25.870 --> 02:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
we wanted to kind of make sure in
 
02:49:27.550 --> 02:49:27.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee this morning that it was
 
02:49:30.190 --> 02:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
actually very clearly stated and I did
 
02:49:32.469 --> 02:49:32.479 align:start position:0%
check with attorney AER how out in the
 
02:49:32.479 --> 02:49:34.349 align:start position:0%
check with attorney AER how out in the
hall

02:49:34.349 --> 02:49:34.359 align:start position:0%
hall
 
02:49:37.550 --> 02:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
subsequently um so we're going to add on
 
02:49:40.469 --> 02:49:40.479 align:start position:0%
at line eight we're going to add
 
02:49:44.030 --> 02:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
e which will and I was grammatically
 
02:49:46.910 --> 02:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
corrected by the OS lawyer I had just
 
02:49:49.190 --> 02:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
put veterans and he said if you read it
 
02:49:50.910 --> 02:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
says shall facilitate the issuance of a
 
02:49:54.630 --> 02:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
license or certification for a person
 
02:49:57.630 --> 02:49:57.640 align:start position:0%
and he suggested who is a veteran and
 
02:49:59.550 --> 02:49:59.560 align:start position:0%
may I believe it should be or is a
 
02:50:01.870 --> 02:50:01.880 align:start position:0%
veteran because those other requirements
 
02:50:01.880 --> 02:50:02.870 align:start position:0%
veteran because those other requirements
are

02:50:02.870 --> 02:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:50:05.670 --> 02:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
all take the hand out of
 
02:50:08.710 --> 02:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
here and out of line seven and out of
 
02:50:12.469 --> 02:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
line seven yep well no I mean the ABCD
 
02:50:16.070 --> 02:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
are all requirements for a a trailing
 
02:50:16.080 --> 02:50:17.630 align:start position:0%
are all requirements for a a trailing
spouse

02:50:17.630 --> 02:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
spouse
 
02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:22.710 align:start position:0%
spouse
essentially

02:50:22.710 --> 02:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:25.269 --> 02:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
anyway so it's not so simple
 
02:50:27.309 --> 02:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
so or
 
02:50:29.710 --> 02:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
yeah and as I haven't seen it yet I
 
02:50:33.150 --> 02:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
don't know what he may have actually uh
 
02:50:35.590 --> 02:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
come up with okay representative
 
02:50:35.600 --> 02:50:36.670 align:start position:0%
come up with okay representative
representative

02:50:36.670 --> 02:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:50:39.309 --> 02:50:39.319 align:start position:0%
Simon oh um I was just saying yeah I
 
02:50:42.349 --> 02:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
think you need an or there yeah an
 
02:50:46.030 --> 02:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
e u I'd like to add that there's a
 
02:50:49.190 --> 02:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal note here it is indeterminable
 
02:50:52.950 --> 02:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
the agitant general has said that they
 
02:50:55.150 --> 02:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
they're already responsible for doing
 
02:50:57.750 --> 02:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
this work this just clarifies their
 
02:50:59.710 --> 02:50:59.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility a little and they can do
 
02:51:03.229 --> 02:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
it within their current budget the oplc
 
02:51:05.830 --> 02:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
is already required
 
02:51:11.790 --> 02:51:11.800 align:start position:0%
to uh facilitate licenses for military
 
02:51:14.910 --> 02:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
and their spouses that's in current law
 
02:51:17.070 --> 02:51:17.080 align:start position:0%
this again is mostly clarifying for
 
02:51:23.590 --> 02:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:29.070 --> 02:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
um agencies that are not in oplc are
 
02:51:33.030 --> 02:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
work are working with the veterans to
 
02:51:36.150 --> 02:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
get their requirements in but the the
 
02:51:39.750 --> 02:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
veterans agency oh me the
 
02:51:42.830 --> 02:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
um is the one that has the knowledge of
 
02:51:45.870 --> 02:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
what the military codes mean and how it
 
02:51:48.710 --> 02:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
applies to civilian life and they will
 
02:51:51.110 --> 02:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
be working with the individuals so that
 
02:51:53.990 --> 02:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
they can get their license or in some
 
02:51:56.110 --> 02:51:56.120 align:start position:0%
cases confirmation that they don't need
 
02:51:56.120 --> 02:51:56.990 align:start position:0%
cases confirmation that they don't need
a

02:51:56.990 --> 02:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:52:02.710 --> 02:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
license and uh and that's already in the
 
02:52:08.030 --> 02:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:08.040 --> 02:52:09.870 align:start position:0%
 
else

02:52:09.870 --> 02:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
else
 
02:52:13.510 --> 02:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
1090 needs to be get
 
02:52:16.790 --> 02:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
a at the moment representative Brown has
 
02:52:21.469 --> 02:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
requested an amendment that adds in
 
02:52:23.790 --> 02:52:23.800 align:start position:0%
veterans on page
 
02:52:26.870 --> 02:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
three U but is otherwise identical to
 
02:52:29.670 --> 02:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
this this amendment so we're not going
 
02:52:32.830 --> 02:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
to be voting right
 
02:52:36.070 --> 02:52:36.080 align:start position:0%

02:53:40.750 --> 02:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:53:44.590 --> 02:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
okay comments grammatical Corrections
 
02:53:47.429 --> 02:53:47.439 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
02:53:47.439 --> 02:53:48.990 align:start position:0%
uh representative
goalie

02:53:48.990 --> 02:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
goalie
 
02:53:52.030 --> 02:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
I just question the need for this
 
02:53:54.269 --> 02:53:54.279 align:start position:0%
amendment when you look on page two line
 
02:53:56.550 --> 02:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
15 specifically says in the heading
 
02:53:59.670 --> 02:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
military service members spouse and
 
02:54:02.110 --> 02:54:02.120 align:start position:0%
Veterans and all of this falls under
 
02:54:04.349 --> 02:54:04.359 align:start position:0%
that heading so why do we need to add
 
02:54:06.750 --> 02:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
veterans specifically if it's already
 
02:54:09.190 --> 02:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
what this statute talks about that is
 
02:54:12.309 --> 02:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
the question and if I
 
02:54:14.510 --> 02:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
might thank you madam chair and
 
02:54:16.990 --> 02:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
representative goalie uh I we had this
 
02:54:18.830 --> 02:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
conversation subcommittee believe
 
02:54:21.510 --> 02:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
attorney Oster how here and said the
 
02:54:23.710 --> 02:54:23.720 align:start position:0%
same thing that because it's in the
 
02:54:26.550 --> 02:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
heading we may not need it I was
 
02:54:29.750 --> 02:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
concerned that it it appeared to be left
 
02:54:32.269 --> 02:54:32.279 align:start position:0%
out in this list and I guess I could I
 
02:54:33.990 --> 02:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
can defer to the attorney and or the
 
02:54:36.630 --> 02:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee on this little
 
02:54:36.640 --> 02:54:39.269 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee on this little
specific

02:54:39.269 --> 02:54:39.279 align:start position:0%
specific
 
02:54:43.110 --> 02:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:46.229 --> 02:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
else represent goie thank you madam
 
02:54:48.670 --> 02:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
chair um just to state that if we do
 
02:54:51.990 --> 02:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
pass this amendment I'm fine with it as
 
02:54:53.590 --> 02:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
is without another amendment coming
 
02:54:55.990 --> 02:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
forward to make that one minor change
 
02:54:58.990 --> 02:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
okay other I tend to
 
02:55:02.630 --> 02:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
agree okay any anyone else want to step
 
02:55:04.790 --> 02:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
in representative Simon wanted to say
 
02:55:06.309 --> 02:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
it'll make representative Brown's lunch
 
02:55:08.670 --> 02:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
easier he doesn't have to deal with it
 
02:55:10.910 --> 02:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
ah we don't want indigestion anywhere
 
02:55:14.349 --> 02:55:14.359 align:start position:0%
that's for sure all right so Madam chair
 
02:55:16.950 --> 02:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
I I I'll agree I I was just I was
 
02:55:18.830 --> 02:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
concerned that it wasn't specific enough
 
02:55:21.670 --> 02:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
but enough people with more expertise
 
02:55:23.469 --> 02:55:23.479 align:start position:0%
than me and experience have said so and
 
02:55:26.990 --> 02:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
I think the attorney was already had um
 
02:55:28.790 --> 02:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
stated that so I'm okay with going with
 
02:55:34.110 --> 02:55:34.120 align:start position:0%
it as is okay so the with with that
 
02:55:36.670 --> 02:55:36.680 align:start position:0%

04:22:22.990 --> 04:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:25.910 --> 04:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:22:31.030 --> 04:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
um we're going to take up 1526 and then
 
04:22:34.870 --> 04:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
1521 so 1526 is the conditional
 
04:22:37.950 --> 04:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
veterinarian license represent
 
04:22:40.309 --> 04:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
blackis do you have a
 
04:22:42.950 --> 04:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
motion I do Madam chair representative
 
04:22:44.950 --> 04:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
gold has a motion
 
04:22:47.189 --> 04:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
excellent what is your motion I would
 
04:22:51.070 --> 04:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
like to move a to pass on House Bill
 
04:22:52.870 --> 04:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
1526 all
 
04:22:54.910 --> 04:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
right do you wish to speak to your
 
04:22:56.750 --> 04:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
motion sure this bill enables the board
 
04:22:58.630 --> 04:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
of veterinarian medicine to issue a
 
04:23:00.830 --> 04:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
conditional veterinarian license for
 
04:23:02.790 --> 04:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
veterinarians who are educated in other
 
04:23:05.229 --> 04:23:05.239 align:start position:0%
countries in order to address the
 
04:23:07.630 --> 04:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
serious shortage of veterinarians in New
 
04:23:09.990 --> 04:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a farmer I can tell you
 
04:23:11.750 --> 04:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
I've had animals die because I can't get
 
04:23:15.590 --> 04:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
a veterinarian out I've gotten um
 
04:23:19.189 --> 04:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
requests from the oh I'm not going to
 
04:23:20.469 --> 04:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
say their name right but the women of
 
04:23:22.630 --> 04:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Farm Bureau to please
 
04:23:26.030 --> 04:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
do everything in my power to assist in
 
04:23:28.630 --> 04:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
in alleviating the serious serious
 
04:23:31.870 --> 04:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
veterans veterinarians shortage in New
 
04:23:35.429 --> 04:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but this bill is very very
 
04:23:38.710 --> 04:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
conservative in that the veterinarian
 
04:23:40.910 --> 04:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
educated in a foreign country first and
 
04:23:44.830 --> 04:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
foremost has to be um have legal status
 
04:23:46.830 --> 04:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as
 
04:23:50.389 --> 04:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
verified by uh information that's
 
04:23:53.550 --> 04:23:53.560 align:start position:0%
maintained by the US citizenship and
 
04:23:55.469 --> 04:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
Immigration Services they must be
 
04:23:58.149 --> 04:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
employed by a veterinarian service and
 
04:24:00.309 --> 04:24:00.319 align:start position:0%
they must be under supervision of a
 
04:24:03.670 --> 04:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
licensed veterinarian we also heard in
 
04:24:07.670 --> 04:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
testimony that there's a a serious lag
 
04:24:09.950 --> 04:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
in the processing of these
 
04:24:13.030 --> 04:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
ecfvg certificates that are required in
 
04:24:15.189 --> 04:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
order to complete the licensing process
 
04:24:17.790 --> 04:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire so this is
 
04:24:19.469 --> 04:24:19.479 align:start position:0%
just a temporary measure to give a
 
04:24:21.750 --> 04:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
conditional license that allows them to
 
04:24:24.429 --> 04:24:24.439 align:start position:0%
get through that process before and that
 
04:24:26.229 --> 04:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
the board the veterinarian board has the
 
04:24:27.830 --> 04:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
right to revoke these conditional
 
04:24:30.790 --> 04:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
licenses at any time for any reason so
 
04:24:32.790 --> 04:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
it seemed a no-brainer to me and I hope
 
04:24:34.910 --> 04:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
you all will support it thank you
 
04:24:36.950 --> 04:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative laus thank you I agree
 
04:24:39.550 --> 04:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
with uh everything she said the only
 
04:24:40.990 --> 04:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
thing I'll I'll point out is that when
 
04:24:43.429 --> 04:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
you talk about uh uh completing the
 
04:24:45.189 --> 04:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
process could take an extended period of
 
04:24:46.990 --> 04:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
time it can take over a
 
04:24:51.550 --> 04:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
year um and you know they've already
 
04:24:54.550 --> 04:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
completed their uh you know they've had
 
04:24:57.070 --> 04:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
training as a veterinarian and they've
 
04:24:59.269 --> 04:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
completed all all the steps except
 
04:25:01.070 --> 04:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
they're clinical and the examination
 
04:25:03.309 --> 04:25:03.319 align:start position:0%
goes with it and the problem is as I
 
04:25:04.510 --> 04:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
recall I think there's only a couple
 
04:25:06.830 --> 04:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
places in the country with a total of
 
04:25:10.550 --> 04:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
maybe 200 seats for that program and so
 
04:25:13.349 --> 04:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
getting into it can take uh
 
04:25:15.670 --> 04:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
over a year and then I mean not only
 
04:25:16.950 --> 04:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
will this provide more Veterinary
 
04:25:18.429 --> 04:25:18.439 align:start position:0%
service but it'll take these people who
 
04:25:19.790 --> 04:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
are trained veterinarians operating
 
04:25:21.990 --> 04:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
under supervision put them in a position
 
04:25:23.349 --> 04:25:23.359 align:start position:0%
where they can at least make some money
 
04:25:24.950 --> 04:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
while they're they're you know earn a
 
04:25:27.429 --> 04:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
living while they're trying to uh do
 
04:25:29.030 --> 04:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
their best to complete the process and
 
04:25:35.590 --> 04:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:39.950 --> 04:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
so anyone other comments
 
04:25:42.389 --> 04:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
questions yeah I'd like to expand on
 
04:25:45.950 --> 04:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
what representative Le has said is that
 
04:25:50.229 --> 04:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
this final test must be done in the US
 
04:25:53.510 --> 04:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
and as he said there's only very few
 
04:25:56.030 --> 04:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
slots and you so you would have to be
 
04:25:58.870 --> 04:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
here waiting for a year and this bill
 
04:26:02.670 --> 04:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
would allow the person to um like you
 
04:26:05.510 --> 04:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
say earn a living while they're
 
04:26:10.109 --> 04:26:10.119 align:start position:0%
waiting all right any repr of man py
 
04:26:13.189 --> 04:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um before they get
 
04:26:16.910 --> 04:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
the practicum is there a path where they
 
04:26:21.750 --> 04:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
get the education and their training
 
04:26:24.550 --> 04:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
accredited with there are agencies that
 
04:26:29.070 --> 04:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
does accreditation for international
 
04:26:33.429 --> 04:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
uh yes according to the testimony we
 
04:26:37.910 --> 04:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
heard they they have already to they in
 
04:26:41.469 --> 04:26:41.479 align:start position:0%
order to get to take this practical test
 
04:26:43.389 --> 04:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
they have to have completed the training
 
04:26:45.790 --> 04:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
and taken the
 
04:26:50.030 --> 04:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
um uh essentially the licensing exam for
 
04:26:53.389 --> 04:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
veterinarian and a test in English so
 
04:26:55.910 --> 04:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
that they they should be able to to work
 
04:26:59.429 --> 04:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
once they complete the
 
04:27:03.070 --> 04:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
um the Practical the Hands-On exam which
 
04:27:05.349 --> 04:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
is not always given in in other
 
04:27:09.189 --> 04:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
countries follow even before they take
 
04:27:11.630 --> 04:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
the exam and stuff and they come in when
 
04:27:13.710 --> 04:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
I had my Masters in speech language
 
04:27:16.510 --> 04:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
pathology that was not from here and my
 
04:27:19.309 --> 04:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
undergrad and Masters had to be sent to
 
04:27:22.550 --> 04:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
a different agency to say the curriculum
 
04:27:26.710 --> 04:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
and the credits were up toart to what
 
04:27:30.469 --> 04:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
was uh here that is the education so
 
04:27:34.790 --> 04:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
that the veterinary schools in other
 
04:27:39.510 --> 04:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
countries might have accredited one so
 
04:27:41.469 --> 04:27:41.479 align:start position:0%
that that's all I'm trying I'm not
 
04:27:41.479 --> 04:27:42.790 align:start position:0%
that that's all I'm trying I'm not
asking

04:27:42.790 --> 04:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
asking
 
04:27:45.309 --> 04:27:45.319 align:start position:0%
there these people have completed all
 
04:27:47.910 --> 04:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
steps of the
 
04:27:50.469 --> 04:27:50.479 align:start position:0%
ecfvg which is something for foreign
 
04:27:52.590 --> 04:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
veterinarian graduates I
 
04:27:56.950 --> 04:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
imagine um and so there is a
 
04:27:56.960 --> 04:27:59.429 align:start position:0%
imagine um and so there is a
um

04:27:59.429 --> 04:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:03.269 --> 04:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
um there is an established pathway that
 
04:28:04.990 --> 04:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
looks at their
 
04:28:07.590 --> 04:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
education it used to be there for the
 
04:28:07.600 --> 04:28:09.309 align:start position:0%
education it used to be there for the
doctors

04:28:09.309 --> 04:28:09.319 align:start position:0%
doctors
 
04:28:13.309 --> 04:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
ecfmg uh was the doctor's of for medical
 
04:28:17.070 --> 04:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
doctors that was available and uh that
 
04:28:19.229 --> 04:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
was in that was
 
04:28:23.070 --> 04:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
stopped in 90s I believe well it still
 
04:28:26.670 --> 04:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
seems to be working for veteran yeah so
 
04:28:30.109 --> 04:28:30.119 align:start position:0%
yes good to know any other questions or
 
04:28:32.870 --> 04:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
comments represent LE just wanted to
 
04:28:35.030 --> 04:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
point out that there is an FN but uh
 
04:28:38.149 --> 04:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
oplc said the cost will in determin it
 
04:28:39.670 --> 04:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
could be absorbed in their budget so
 
04:28:42.950 --> 04:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
there's no significant impact
 
04:28:45.429 --> 04:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Shu thank you
 
04:28:48.630 --> 04:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
madam chus I had concerns about this
 
04:28:53.149 --> 04:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
also um however um after speaking to
 
04:28:55.670 --> 04:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
members of the subcommittee um they
 
04:28:58.229 --> 04:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
pointed out that the bill specifically
 
04:29:00.950 --> 04:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
states that while this person is
 
04:29:03.910 --> 04:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
awaiting their opportunity to get the
 
04:29:06.630 --> 04:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
test they can practice but it has to be
 
04:29:10.109 --> 04:29:10.119 align:start position:0%
under the supervision of a licensed uh
 
04:29:13.510 --> 04:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
veterinarian or Veterinary practice so I
 
04:29:16.349 --> 04:29:16.359 align:start position:0%
think that uh assures me that they will
 
04:29:20.710 --> 04:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
be uh adhering to the practices that are
 
04:29:24.550 --> 04:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you anyone else
 
04:29:27.149 --> 04:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
represent Brown thank you madam chair um
 
04:29:30.990 --> 04:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
following up on on your uh
 
04:29:33.550 --> 04:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
statement do do we know what supervision
 
04:29:34.550 --> 04:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
means because we've had this
 
04:29:37.109 --> 04:29:37.119 align:start position:0%
conversation in another bill about
 
04:29:39.790 --> 04:29:39.800 align:start position:0%
assistance and tethering and untethering
 
04:29:41.910 --> 04:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
from their their doctor uh do we know
 
04:29:44.189 --> 04:29:44.199 align:start position:0%
what supervision means and just as a
 
04:29:46.229 --> 04:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
quicky educational commission for
 
04:29:47.830 --> 04:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
foreign Veterinary
 
04:29:51.510 --> 04:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
graduates ah thank you representative
 
04:29:53.670 --> 04:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
leus you have an answer to that I I
 
04:29:56.790 --> 04:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
think so um it actually providing such
 
04:29:59.109 --> 04:29:59.119 align:start position:0%
person is employed by and practices the
 
04:30:00.510 --> 04:30:00.520 align:start position:0%
profession under the supervision of a
 
04:30:02.469 --> 04:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
duly license veterinarian so they
 
04:30:04.750 --> 04:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
actually have to be employed by the
 
04:30:08.309 --> 04:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
veterinarian or or the office so that're
 
04:30:09.870 --> 04:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
you know they're they're tied together a
 
04:30:11.550 --> 04:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
lot more closely than like the the some
 
04:30:13.550 --> 04:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
of the other things we've heard about
 
04:30:16.109 --> 04:30:16.119 align:start position:0%
the other thing it says um might
 
04:30:18.349 --> 04:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
alleviate some concerns a conditional
 
04:30:20.389 --> 04:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
license may be summarily revoked by a
 
04:30:22.790 --> 04:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
majority vote of the board of Veterinary
 
04:30:24.189 --> 04:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
practice so I mean they don't even have
 
04:30:25.750 --> 04:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
to do the normal due process
 
04:30:27.550 --> 04:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
investigation everything if they've got
 
04:30:30.030 --> 04:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
a conditional license so if there are
 
04:30:32.309 --> 04:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
any complaints coming in I imagine
 
04:30:34.830 --> 04:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
they'd be dealt with pretty promptly
 
04:30:34.840 --> 04:30:37.149 align:start position:0%
they'd be dealt with pretty promptly

Amendment

04:32:02.870 --> 04:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:32:07.550 --> 04:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
0902 H to House Bill
 
04:32:15.910 --> 04:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:19.429 --> 04:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh before we discuss this amendment this
 
04:32:24.910 --> 04:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
is a replace all so we have to decide
 
04:32:28.109 --> 04:32:28.119 align:start position:0%
first if we want to support the
 
04:32:28.119 --> 04:32:29.189 align:start position:0%
first if we want to support the
amendment

04:32:29.189 --> 04:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:32:33.550 --> 04:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
itself as given to us and secondly if we
 
04:32:36.189 --> 04:32:36.199 align:start position:0%
do if we do support it then what do we
 
04:32:39.510 --> 04:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
want to do with the content of
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
1521 we have a couple of choic ches the
 
04:32:46.070 --> 04:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
ones that I would recommend were would
 
04:32:50.870 --> 04:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
be to add some portion of
 
04:32:53.790 --> 04:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
1521 into house bill
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
1622 which is also about administrative
 
04:32:59.990 --> 04:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
rul making and so the content would be
 
04:33:01.349 --> 04:33:01.359 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:33:03.670 --> 04:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
germine uh so if we have that there's
 
04:33:07.230 --> 04:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
sub piece of the original 1521 we want
 
04:33:10.750 --> 04:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
to include we can add it to
 
04:33:14.109 --> 04:33:14.119 align:start position:0%
um 1622 if we want it to pass
 
04:33:18.109 --> 04:33:18.119 align:start position:0%
immediately or we could decide to add
 
04:33:21.590 --> 04:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
the concerns from
 
04:33:26.349 --> 04:33:26.359 align:start position:0%
1521 to a committee study of the topic
 
04:33:29.150 --> 04:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
which we can do without a bill uh the
 
04:33:31.949 --> 04:33:31.959 align:start position:0%
administrating rulemaking process is
 
04:33:34.670 --> 04:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
well within our scope we can just put a
 
04:33:37.789 --> 04:33:37.799 align:start position:0%
committee on it and work on it
 
04:33:37.799 --> 04:33:39.470 align:start position:0%
committee on it and work on it
because

04:33:39.470 --> 04:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:33:45.029 --> 04:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:48.109 --> 04:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
are are one thing the actual language of
 
04:33:49.789 --> 04:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
the bill is another and we could
 
04:33:52.750 --> 04:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
certainly study the issues raised
 
04:33:55.150 --> 04:33:55.160 align:start position:0%
without having a bill to tie it to
 
04:33:55.160 --> 04:33:56.269 align:start position:0%
without having a bill to tie it to
representative

04:33:56.269 --> 04:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:33:59.029 --> 04:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you mam chair well I I I
 
04:34:03.029 --> 04:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the the the little cqu
 
04:34:05.830 --> 04:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
you've started off here uh I I'm very
 
04:34:08.269 --> 04:34:08.279 align:start position:0%
much in support of the non- gerain
 
04:34:11.150 --> 04:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
amendment uh having participated as a
 
04:34:13.109 --> 04:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
couple of us were able to a couple days
 
04:34:16.910 --> 04:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
ago um in the hearing on the non gerine
 
04:34:19.390 --> 04:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment I'm very supportive but at the
 
04:34:23.150 --> 04:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
same time I I don't want to jettison the
 
04:34:26.269 --> 04:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
uh the content of of the underlying
 
04:34:28.670 --> 04:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
content in other words of the bill as
 
04:34:30.949 --> 04:34:30.959 align:start position:0%
filed because I think it really is an
 
04:34:34.390 --> 04:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
issue uh with some of the agencies that
 
04:34:38.349 --> 04:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
that are not sufficiently uh open to uh
 
04:34:40.150 --> 04:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
input from the public and which
 
04:34:43.789 --> 04:34:43.799 align:start position:0%
sometimes is very M and very appropriate
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
and needs to be out there so that the
 
04:34:48.670 --> 04:34:48.680 align:start position:0%
people can see it that are not
 
04:34:52.230 --> 04:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily watching the hearing or
 
04:34:54.789 --> 04:34:54.799 align:start position:0%
whatever the agency is presenting or
 
04:34:57.789 --> 04:34:57.799 align:start position:0%
doing at that particular time uh and
 
04:34:59.949 --> 04:34:59.959 align:start position:0%
I've seen it in with regard to some
 
04:35:03.109 --> 04:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
issues in the city of Rochester which is
 
04:35:06.189 --> 04:35:06.199 align:start position:0%
in straford County as you know where I
 
04:35:08.230 --> 04:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh where I am the chairman of the of the
 
04:35:11.029 --> 04:35:11.039 align:start position:0%
delegation uh so I I think your your
 
04:35:13.709 --> 04:35:13.719 align:start position:0%
proposal is is a very excellent one and
 
04:35:15.470 --> 04:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
I hope the committee will be supportive
 
04:35:18.429 --> 04:35:18.439 align:start position:0%
of retaining some and and doing
 
04:35:20.910 --> 04:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
something this year with the underlying
 
04:35:23.990 --> 04:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
thing I like the idea of studying it uh
 
04:35:25.590 --> 04:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
because I think it deserves more than
 
04:35:28.070 --> 04:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
just a
 
04:35:30.230 --> 04:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
compressed treatment of it at this
 
04:35:32.269 --> 04:35:32.279 align:start position:0%
particular time which was all we would
 
04:35:34.750 --> 04:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
get if we were tacking it onto something
 
04:35:37.429 --> 04:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
else um and we wouldn't get anything
 
04:35:40.029 --> 04:35:40.039 align:start position:0%
this year so anyway that I've said
 
04:35:44.510 --> 04:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
enough for the moment okay um in that
 
04:35:49.590 --> 04:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
case with without objection we we will
 
04:35:53.109 --> 04:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
take up the some the content of 1521
 
04:35:55.670 --> 04:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
when we are discussing
 
04:35:58.510 --> 04:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
1622 and decide if there is something we
 
04:36:02.029 --> 04:36:02.039 align:start position:0%
want to spec amend to pass this year and
 
04:36:04.910 --> 04:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
other and we will and at that point
 
04:36:08.230 --> 04:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
we'll also decide if we need to create a
 
04:36:10.510 --> 04:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
study committee on it okay
 
04:36:12.109 --> 04:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
representative Simon thank thank you
 
04:36:13.750 --> 04:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so um we're
 
04:36:15.789 --> 04:36:15.799 align:start position:0%
talking about adding something to 1622
 
04:36:17.390 --> 04:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
we have that on the docket for today so
 
04:36:21.390 --> 04:36:21.400 align:start position:0%
are we going to delay that it's the next
 
04:36:24.590 --> 04:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
one no I mean so we have to be ready to
 
04:36:28.189 --> 04:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:31.230 --> 04:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
well right so the question is do we
 
04:36:33.949 --> 04:36:33.959 align:start position:0%
support this amendment and if we do we
 
04:36:36.949 --> 04:36:36.959 align:start position:0%
will consider the content the original
 
04:36:38.390 --> 04:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
content of
 
04:36:41.869 --> 04:36:41.879 align:start position:0%
1521 while we are discussing 1622 to
 
04:36:44.230 --> 04:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
because it it could be added to it
 
04:36:45.910 --> 04:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
appropriately it is
 
04:36:48.629 --> 04:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
Germain would we need to get an
 
04:36:50.470 --> 04:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
amendment and bring that back next week
 
04:36:52.510 --> 04:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
we might very well need to do that okay
 
04:36:55.109 --> 04:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
thank you but we we are coming back next
 
04:36:58.910 --> 04:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
week anyway so yep can be done Madam
 
04:37:00.830 --> 04:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
chair representative ghoul thank you
 
04:37:04.070 --> 04:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
madam chair for taking my question um
 
04:37:06.470 --> 04:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand are we saying
 
04:37:09.750 --> 04:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
that when we talk about 1622 we may want
 
04:37:14.910 --> 04:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
to amend 1622 to include some of the pro
 
04:37:19.551 --> 04:37:19.561 align:start position:0%
provisions of the original 1521 yes so
 
04:37:22.189 --> 04:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
the amendment would stay the same and
 
04:37:24.869 --> 04:37:24.879 align:start position:0%
could be processed but we don't want to
 
04:37:26.029 --> 04:37:26.039 align:start position:0%
act on
 
04:37:27.830 --> 04:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
it in
 
04:37:31.109 --> 04:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
hindsight attaching this amendment which
 
04:37:35.109 --> 04:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
I do support to 1521 was probably not
 
04:37:37.789 --> 04:37:37.799 align:start position:0%
the best decision it should have gone
 
04:37:41.830 --> 04:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
onto uh 1286 the uh combining the board
 
04:37:45.390 --> 04:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
of of
 
04:37:47.990 --> 04:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
which is not we don't need to worry
 
04:37:50.990 --> 04:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
about follow up followup so my only
 
04:37:52.869 --> 04:37:52.879 align:start position:0%
point is I really think this is
 
04:37:56.310 --> 04:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
important the um recovery houses are
 
04:37:57.830 --> 04:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
very near and dear to my heart and
 
04:37:59.590 --> 04:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
important and this would be good
 
04:38:03.269 --> 04:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
legislation for my town and so it
 
04:38:06.269 --> 04:38:06.279 align:start position:0%
however you I trust your great wisdom in
 
04:38:10.109 --> 04:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
how to best handle it well unfortunately
 
04:38:13.390 --> 04:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
I I found out that we can't just slide
 
04:38:15.109 --> 04:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment over to another bill
 
04:38:18.230 --> 04:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
without another hearing but since we do
 
04:38:21.390 --> 04:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
have a another bill that would be gerain
 
04:38:23.910 --> 04:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
to the original 1521 I think we should
 
04:38:25.269 --> 04:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
cover it
 
04:38:28.109 --> 04:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
there all right so on the amendment
 
04:38:30.429 --> 04:38:30.439 align:start position:0%
which representative grot do you wish to
 
04:38:33.990 --> 04:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:37.349 --> 04:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment I'm so sorry I apologize could
 
04:38:38.629 --> 04:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
you please repeat you want me to speak
 
04:38:41.150 --> 04:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
to my motion yes okay or the the
 
04:38:44.230 --> 04:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
amendment the amendment okay so the
 
04:38:46.670 --> 04:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
amendment to 1521 replaces the entire
 
04:38:48.551 --> 04:38:48.561 align:start position:0%
bill with a bill that's related to
 
04:38:50.590 --> 04:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
recovery houses and one of the issues
 
04:38:54.429 --> 04:38:54.439 align:start position:0%
that has happened is that because
 
04:38:59.109 --> 04:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
um recovery houses are not identified in
 
04:39:01.869 --> 04:39:01.879 align:start position:0%
Statute in a clear enough manner
 
04:39:06.070 --> 04:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
everyone is using their local um zoning
 
04:39:10.109 --> 04:39:10.119 align:start position:0%
ordinances to Define them and is causing
 
04:39:12.670 --> 04:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
discrepancies throughout the the
 
04:39:17.070 --> 04:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
estate um on how these um facil how
 
04:39:19.789 --> 04:39:19.799 align:start position:0%
these fac facilities are managed for
 
04:39:22.470 --> 04:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
example um
 
04:39:25.029 --> 04:39:25.039 align:start position:0%
individual um purchased a house with a
 
04:39:27.150 --> 04:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
means of having a recovery house and in
 
04:39:30.390 --> 04:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
some in in some um communities if you
 
04:39:33.109 --> 04:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
have two or three more people who are
 
04:39:35.510 --> 04:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
not related living in the same house
 
04:39:39.030 --> 04:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
then it causes a whole throw back throw
 
04:39:41.990 --> 04:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
into the zoning ordinances which can
 
04:39:44.948 --> 04:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
take which can delay the opening of the
 
04:39:47.910 --> 04:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
recovery house and since we need these
 
04:39:49.670 --> 04:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
um and the ones that we have are
 
04:39:53.110 --> 04:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
operating well this was brought forward
 
04:39:56.150 --> 04:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
as a way of resolving the issue so it
 
04:39:58.310 --> 04:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
basically um talks about recovering
 
04:40:00.990 --> 04:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
houses meaning primarily a non-transient
 
04:40:03.230 --> 04:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
dwelling or dwelling unit that provides
 
04:40:06.948 --> 04:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
substance-free living and um and that
 
04:40:08.230 --> 04:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
the people who are living in the
 
04:40:10.310 --> 04:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
recovery house are living as a single
 
04:40:13.628 --> 04:40:13.638 align:start position:0%
household so that's what defines
 
04:40:17.190 --> 04:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
them um so but it doesn't include a
 
04:40:18.868 --> 04:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
boarding house or a rooming house so
 
04:40:21.230 --> 04:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
it's very clear that it's only meant for
 
04:40:24.030 --> 04:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
those people in recovery so I think that
 
04:40:26.270 --> 04:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
the bill um is important enough that we
 
04:40:28.390 --> 04:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
address it and that's why I'm attaching
 
04:40:31.670 --> 04:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
it to 1521 and I realized that it is
 
04:40:33.990 --> 04:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
caused a whole bunch of problems for
 
04:40:36.750 --> 04:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
1521 but it's not something that we can
 
04:40:38.628 --> 04:40:38.638 align:start position:0%
be res that can be
 
04:40:42.150 --> 04:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
resolved right so thank you because I
 
04:40:43.788 --> 04:40:43.798 align:start position:0%
know that
 
04:40:47.550 --> 04:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
people understand that um 15201 was
 
04:40:50.590 --> 04:40:50.600 align:start position:0%
trying to address something and I think
 
04:40:52.948 --> 04:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
that well I'm G to stop at that right
 
04:40:54.590 --> 04:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
now I'm not going to go any further we
 
04:40:55.868 --> 04:40:55.878 align:start position:0%
can talk about it later okay
 
04:40:57.390 --> 04:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
representative goalie you wish to speak
 
04:40:59.628 --> 04:40:59.638 align:start position:0%
to your second time thank you madam
 
04:41:01.750 --> 04:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
chair the only uh other comment I'll
 
04:41:04.830 --> 04:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
make is that we received a letter email
 
04:41:06.590 --> 04:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
to us from the Fire Marshall who is in
 
04:41:08.430 --> 04:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
support of this
 
04:41:12.830 --> 04:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
change yes that was your main Amendment
 
04:41:15.708 --> 04:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
on the yes that's the subject of our
 
04:41:17.550 --> 04:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
current debate good well that's that's
 
04:41:20.350 --> 04:41:20.360 align:start position:0%
important to hear from him
 
04:41:20.360 --> 04:41:22.270 align:start position:0%
important to hear from him
yes

04:41:22.270 --> 04:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:41:25.350 --> 04:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
so yes any uh
 
04:41:27.948 --> 04:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
other com
 
04:41:32.390 --> 04:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
muty it's it's a question um this is
 
04:41:37.070 --> 04:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
similar to group homes uh that was in
 
04:41:40.550 --> 04:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
the 90s and early 2000 for people with
 
04:41:43.190 --> 04:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
developmental disability living in the
 
04:41:46.270 --> 04:41:46.280 align:start position:0%
community with staff or is it there no
 
04:41:48.270 --> 04:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
staff it's a private residence it's a
 
04:41:50.190 --> 04:41:50.200 align:start position:0%
private residence there no staff a
 
04:41:53.350 --> 04:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
Recovery House are people who are sober
 
04:41:55.510 --> 04:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
and living in the house with other
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
people okay thank you it's not a medical
 
04:42:01.390 --> 04:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
or counseling or anything
 
04:42:04.868 --> 04:42:04.878 align:start position:0%
facility may I Madam chair having been
 
04:42:06.788 --> 04:42:06.798 align:start position:0%
there at the hearing you recall that
 
04:42:08.868 --> 04:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
they did talk about a
 
04:42:11.150 --> 04:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
manager uh so I don't know whe that
 
04:42:13.788 --> 04:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
certainly would be considered staff but
 
04:42:15.230 --> 04:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
I think there is a clear difference to
 
04:42:18.070 --> 04:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
group homes and between and the recovery
 
04:42:22.030 --> 04:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
houses yeah it but uh at the hearing
 
04:42:23.788 --> 04:42:23.798 align:start position:0%
they did mention they might have an
 
04:42:27.750 --> 04:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
employee there who would be you
 
04:42:31.708 --> 04:42:31.718 align:start position:0%
know who who would also be working his
 
04:42:33.750 --> 04:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
way through recovery and would do things
 
04:42:35.948 --> 04:42:35.958 align:start position:0%
like make sure the the bills got paid
 
04:42:37.708 --> 04:42:37.718 align:start position:0%
and every and
 
04:42:37.718 --> 04:42:39.628 align:start position:0%
and every and
uh

04:42:39.628 --> 04:42:39.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:42:43.270 --> 04:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
um not so much as a as
 
04:42:46.830 --> 04:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
a as a counselor as somebody that's
 
04:42:50.868 --> 04:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:54.230 --> 04:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
house that it's not left in the hands of
 
04:42:56.190 --> 04:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
the the people who are there who are in
 
04:42:58.990 --> 04:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
recovery and and who are obviously in a
 
04:43:01.948 --> 04:43:01.958 align:start position:0%
fragile situation in their lives so the
 
04:43:04.830 --> 04:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
ma there was a clear reference to a
 
04:43:07.708 --> 04:43:07.718 align:start position:0%
manager on on
 
04:43:12.110 --> 04:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
board some anyone else representative
 
04:43:15.628 --> 04:43:15.638 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair um I also
 
04:43:18.030 --> 04:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
attended the uh subcommittee meeting on
 
04:43:20.390 --> 04:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
the non-gain amendment and I may be
 
04:43:23.310 --> 04:43:23.320 align:start position:0%
stating the obvious but um these
 
04:43:27.110 --> 04:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
recovery houses are a large part of
 
04:43:30.110 --> 04:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
folks who are attempting to recover from
 
04:43:33.310 --> 04:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
substance abuse and we obviously have a
 
04:43:36.470 --> 04:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
large problem with that in this state
 
04:43:38.990 --> 04:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
and I think this is an important step to
 
04:43:41.750 --> 04:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
aiding those people who are willing to
 
04:43:46.230 --> 04:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
try and recover thank you anyone else
 
04:43:49.430 --> 04:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
represent Simon thank you madam chair um
 
04:43:51.430 --> 04:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
not obviously not opposed to the content
 
04:43:55.030 --> 04:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
of the amendment um my biggest concern
 
04:43:56.788 --> 04:43:56.798 align:start position:0%
with adopting it is the underlying
 
04:43:59.110 --> 04:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
content and I'm happy to vote for the
 
04:44:01.628 --> 04:44:01.638 align:start position:0%
amendment if uh with the committee's
 
04:44:03.628 --> 04:44:03.638 align:start position:0%
approval I might be allowed to work on
 
04:44:05.550 --> 04:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
the language of 1521 the underlying
 
04:44:07.708 --> 04:44:07.718 align:start position:0%
language to see if it will fit into 1622
 
04:44:12.590 --> 04:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
and bring it back next week okay
 
04:44:15.590 --> 04:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I the testimony we got was that in
 
04:44:20.430 --> 04:44:20.440 align:start position:0%
many cases a person opening a recovery
 
04:44:23.350 --> 04:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
house went would go to the planning

the
 
04:48:19.390 --> 04:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
hearing it deletes the first paragraph
 
04:48:21.868 --> 04:48:21.878 align:start position:0%
of the bill which talks about
 
04:48:26.868 --> 04:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
the um rul making for retention periods
 
04:48:29.230 --> 04:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
because the oplc and the Secretary of
 
04:48:32.350 --> 04:48:32.360 align:start position:0%
State are working on that issue offline
 
04:48:34.070 --> 04:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to have them settle it
 
04:48:36.350 --> 04:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
before we change the
 
04:48:39.910 --> 04:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
law and then it simplifies the language
 
04:48:42.190 --> 04:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
in uh SE
 
04:48:42.200 --> 04:48:44.670 align:start position:0%

I thought several members had already
 
04:49:17.628 --> 04:49:17.638 align:start position:0%

staff presented at the public hearing
 
04:49:39.948 --> 04:49:39.958 align:start position:0%
this is a combination of that Amendment
 
04:49:42.270 --> 04:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
Plus some other changes that were made
 
04:49:44.590 --> 04:49:44.600 align:start position:0%

subcommittee it's it's a historical
 
04:49:55.868 --> 04:49:55.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:00.548 --> 04:50:00.558 align:start position:0%
point yes am is make it impossible to
 
04:50:02.430 --> 04:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
look at
 
04:50:06.910 --> 04:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:09.750 --> 04:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
the so this is the subcommittee
 
04:50:09.760 --> 04:50:11.708 align:start position:0%
the so this is the subcommittee
amendment

04:50:11.708 --> 04:50:11.718 align:start position:0%

04:50:14.310 --> 04:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
and do you want a motion or did you move
 
04:50:16.830 --> 04:50:16.840 align:start position:0%

04:50:21.310 --> 04:50:21.320 align:start position:0%
good representative Shu do you wish to
 
04:50:24.270 --> 04:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
uh talk to you m um I will just state
 
04:50:29.150 --> 04:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
that the um subcommittee um agreed to
 
04:50:32.670 --> 04:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
this unanimously uh we heard from both
 
04:50:36.830 --> 04:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
um jel car staff and oplc that they were
 
04:50:40.150 --> 04:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
in agreement with the amendment and so I
 
04:50:42.230 --> 04:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
think uh it's proper to move forward
 
04:50:47.310 --> 04:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:51.070 --> 04:50:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:51.080 --> 04:50:52.948 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:50:52.948 --> 04:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:50:57.990 --> 04:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:00.430 --> 04:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
amendment seeing none I think we should
 
04:51:04.750 --> 04:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
now move into whatever content from
 
04:51:08.070 --> 04:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
1521 some person some member of the
 
04:51:12.750 --> 04:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
committee wants to include clude in
 
04:51:15.030 --> 04:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
something to be brought forward this
 
04:51:15.040 --> 04:51:17.390 align:start position:0%
something to be brought forward this
year

04:51:17.390 --> 04:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:51:21.788 --> 04:51:21.798 align:start position:0%
um yes representing thank you so
 
04:51:24.868 --> 04:51:24.878 align:start position:0%
um the administrative rules process is
 
04:51:26.548 --> 04:51:26.558 align:start position:0%
one that has
 
04:51:28.788 --> 04:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
many um
 
04:51:31.788 --> 04:51:31.798 align:start position:0%
components and last year and I and I
 
04:51:34.990 --> 04:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:37.708 --> 04:51:37.718 align:start position:0%
avoid making changes to the
 
04:51:39.948 --> 04:51:39.958 align:start position:0%
administrative rule process when the
 
04:51:42.230 --> 04:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
changes that we made last year are still
 
04:51:42.240 --> 04:51:43.030 align:start position:0%
changes that we made last year are still
in

04:51:43.030 --> 04:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:51:45.868 --> 04:51:45.878 align:start position:0%
process I believe last year we did
 
04:51:49.830 --> 04:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
address some of this public response
 
04:51:53.310 --> 04:51:53.320 align:start position:0%
from agencies and those rules are coming
 
04:51:55.990 --> 04:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
to Jael car
 
04:51:59.910 --> 04:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
shortly so and I feel that that was a
 
04:52:03.030 --> 04:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
movement of the dial and before we move
 
04:52:06.150 --> 04:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
the dial again I'd like to see at least
 
04:52:10.230 --> 04:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
where did this take us and can we as a
 
04:52:10.240 --> 04:52:11.110 align:start position:0%
where did this take us and can we as a
Comm

04:52:11.110 --> 04:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
Comm
 
04:52:14.190 --> 04:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
committee agree to meet and talk about
 
04:52:17.230 --> 04:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
this so that we can
 
04:52:22.390 --> 04:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
make a decision that is going to
 
04:52:25.110 --> 04:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
be effective you know make a change
 
04:52:26.750 --> 04:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to be effective that's my
 
04:52:29.190 --> 04:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
concern with just you know willly just
 
04:52:31.190 --> 04:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
at living and just picking stuff out and
 
04:52:33.830 --> 04:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
sticking in something else we we and I
 
04:52:36.390 --> 04:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to Bel labor this but we've
 
04:52:38.390 --> 04:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
seen what it's done to
 
04:52:41.470 --> 04:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
oplc right so I would like try to avoid
 
04:52:44.150 --> 04:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
that with a committee with a with a
 
04:52:46.030 --> 04:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
division with the with the
 
04:52:48.470 --> 04:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
administrative group administrative
 
04:52:52.030 --> 04:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
rules group and Jael car which is
 
04:52:56.470 --> 04:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
complicated enough as it is so that's my
 
04:52:59.590 --> 04:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
my two cents so I don't know if that's
 
04:53:03.590 --> 04:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
helpful um I do believe that there is a
 
04:53:03.600 --> 04:53:04.868 align:start position:0%
helpful um I do believe that there is a
need

04:53:04.868 --> 04:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
need
 
04:53:09.030 --> 04:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
for um 1521 some component perhaps but
 
04:53:11.070 --> 04:53:11.080 align:start position:0%
I'd like to really take a look at it
 
04:53:12.948 --> 04:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
carefully before we add it to something
 
04:53:16.470 --> 04:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
else okay uh I believe the jail car
 
04:53:20.670 --> 04:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
staff has brought some examples of the
 
04:53:23.990 --> 04:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
reports on on public comments to the
 
04:53:26.830 --> 04:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
rules that they can uh present to the
 
04:53:29.350 --> 04:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
committee so you can see what is
 
04:53:31.670 --> 04:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
starting to happen because of the law we
 
04:53:35.190 --> 04:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
passed last year representative lacis y
 
04:53:36.830 --> 04:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't oppose certainly don't
 
04:53:40.070 --> 04:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
oppose the idea of uh taking a look at
 
04:53:41.868 --> 04:53:41.878 align:start position:0%
it care carefully and not doing in the
 
04:53:44.110 --> 04:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
middle of exec session um
 
04:53:46.548 --> 04:53:46.558 align:start position:0%
but I guess my only question is has
 
04:53:48.868 --> 04:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
there been a a draft of the rules that
 
04:53:52.628 --> 04:53:52.638 align:start position:0%
anybody's looked at and is there either
 
04:53:55.070 --> 04:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
oh the rule you said CH that the they're
 
04:53:58.230 --> 04:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
working on rules related to this and my
 
04:54:01.150 --> 04:54:01.160 align:start position:0%
my question is um if any if nobody's
 
04:54:02.548 --> 04:54:02.558 align:start position:0%
looked at them fine or they're not
 
04:54:05.628 --> 04:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
available fine I was just curious if
 
04:54:07.868 --> 04:54:07.878 align:start position:0%
they seem to address the issues dealt
 
04:54:10.868 --> 04:54:10.878 align:start position:0%
with in 1521 or not or if
 
04:54:12.430 --> 04:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
looks like there would be conflict with
 
04:54:13.510 --> 04:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
what's in
 
04:54:17.750 --> 04:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
1521 right now the law we passed last
 
04:54:22.150 --> 04:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
year required that the agency Report
 
04:54:25.110 --> 04:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
with the final propos final proposed
 
04:54:28.390 --> 04:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
rule the public comment they received
 
04:54:30.470 --> 04:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
and their response to it how they dealt
 
04:54:30.480 --> 04:54:31.270 align:start position:0%
and their response to it how they dealt
with

04:54:31.270 --> 04:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:54:34.510 --> 04:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
it which is and here are some samples
 
04:54:37.430 --> 04:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
that you can take a look at that was
 
04:54:41.070 --> 04:54:41.080 align:start position:0%
effective in O for rules starting in
 
04:54:44.510 --> 04:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
October so they're just now starting to
 
04:54:47.910 --> 04:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
come out
 
04:54:51.868 --> 04:54:51.878 align:start position:0%
um all right I may have misspoke in my
 
04:54:55.470 --> 04:54:55.480 align:start position:0%
effort to try to you know be clear what
 
04:54:59.190 --> 04:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
the the the the the what we put together
 
04:55:01.788 --> 04:55:01.798 align:start position:0%
went into effect in October and these
 
04:55:04.350 --> 04:55:04.360 align:start position:0%
the documents that we're seeing are the
 
04:55:06.910 --> 04:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
results of that which is not something
 
04:55:10.030 --> 04:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
that we had before right okay so this is
 
04:55:10.040 --> 04:55:14.708 align:start position:0%
that we had before right okay so this is
new

04:55:14.708 --> 04:55:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:17.110 --> 04:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
okay and you can see there's one from
 
04:55:20.868 --> 04:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
the O OPC there's one from
 
04:55:25.390 --> 04:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
Dees there's a statement from uh the
 
04:55:25.400 --> 04:55:27.788 align:start position:0%
Dees there's a statement from uh the
Lottery

04:55:27.788 --> 04:55:27.798 align:start position:0%
Lottery
 
04:55:31.270 --> 04:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
Commission that's a fairly Hefty one
 
04:55:31.280 --> 04:55:36.230 align:start position:0%
Commission that's a fairly Hefty one
that

04:55:36.230 --> 04:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:40.830 --> 04:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
um the the difference is that 1521 as
 
04:55:44.830 --> 04:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
written as it came to us would
 
04:55:44.840 --> 04:55:46.750 align:start position:0%
written as it came to us would
require

04:55:46.750 --> 04:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
require
 
04:55:51.830 --> 04:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
that this analysis be done
 
04:55:51.840 --> 04:55:53.788 align:start position:0%
that this analysis be done
before

04:55:53.788 --> 04:55:53.798 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:55:58.070 --> 04:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
um um you know give gave it 90 days at
 
04:55:59.910 --> 04:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
the end of the public
 
04:55:59.920 --> 04:56:01.510 align:start position:0%
the end of the public
hearing

04:56:01.510 --> 04:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:56:05.628 --> 04:56:05.638 align:start position:0%
and that's doesn't necessarily agree
 
04:56:08.788 --> 04:56:08.798 align:start position:0%
with the what what is the period for uh
 
04:56:26.310 --> 04:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:28.150 --> 04:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mike morl director of
 
04:56:29.868 --> 04:56:29.878 align:start position:0%
administrative rules within the office
 
04:56:31.190 --> 04:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
of legislative
 
04:56:34.270 --> 04:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
Services uh currently agencies have a
 
04:56:37.270 --> 04:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
180 day limit from the time they filed
 
04:56:40.030 --> 04:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
their initial Proposal with us until
 
04:56:43.150 --> 04:56:43.160 align:start position:0%
they they have to file their final
 
04:56:48.510 --> 04:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
proposal um one thing that the bill as
 
04:56:53.110 --> 04:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
introduced does is ADD 90 days after the
 
04:56:56.310 --> 04:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
agency's had its public hearing um to
 
04:56:59.270 --> 04:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
put together the report that's in here
 
04:57:03.628 --> 04:57:03.638 align:start position:0%
um that adds 90 days onto the whole
 
04:57:06.750 --> 04:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
process which is going to require many
 
04:57:10.788 --> 04:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
changes in the law but um
 
04:57:12.150 --> 04:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
Madam chair would you like me to speak
 
04:57:12.160 --> 04:57:13.190 align:start position:0%
Madam chair would you like me to speak
further

04:57:13.190 --> 04:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:57:16.230 --> 04:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
about um
 
04:57:19.230 --> 04:57:19.240 align:start position:0%
there no I just wanted to know what the
 
04:57:21.750 --> 04:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
the cycle time was it's lengthy enough
 
04:57:26.430 --> 04:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:29.470 --> 04:57:29.480 align:start position:0%
is representative Schmidt thank you
 
04:57:33.030 --> 04:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair so I am not hostile to
 
04:57:36.270 --> 04:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
progress because we we we have been on
 
04:57:39.150 --> 04:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
the Jael car for some time in my case 18
 
04:57:42.190 --> 04:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
years not imagine that Jael car is
 
04:57:44.510 --> 04:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
perfect that the process has been handed
 
04:57:47.948 --> 04:57:47.958 align:start position:0%
down from the from the Divine Throne uh
 
04:57:51.310 --> 04:57:51.320 align:start position:0%
and is sub is uh susceptible to no
 
04:57:54.590 --> 04:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
further Improvement and so I'm open to
 
04:57:56.708 --> 04:57:56.718 align:start position:0%
the idea of anything that is going to
 
04:57:59.548 --> 04:57:59.558 align:start position:0%
improve the process um but I'm also
 
04:58:02.510 --> 04:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
mindful of the fact that that the gel
 
04:58:04.590 --> 04:58:04.600 align:start position:0%
car the administrative rule process is
 
04:58:07.270 --> 04:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
not well understood by the legislature
 
04:58:10.150 --> 04:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
certainly not by the house um in in my
 
04:58:12.788 --> 04:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
my 18 years of
 
04:58:16.390 --> 04:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
attending ja car sessions almost without
 
04:58:20.070 --> 04:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
fail I have seen State reps in front of
 
04:58:23.670 --> 04:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
the Jael car committee at hearings a
 
04:58:27.270 --> 04:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
handful of times it's almost always a p
 
04:58:29.590 --> 04:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
particular person with a particular
 
04:58:32.548 --> 04:58:32.558 align:start position:0%
problem and so and and until I got
 
04:58:34.310 --> 04:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
appointed to jail car I didn't know any
 
04:58:35.948 --> 04:58:35.958 align:start position:0%
more think more about it than most of my
 
04:58:38.190 --> 04:58:38.200 align:start position:0%
colleagues did but I've been doing it
 
04:58:42.150 --> 04:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
diligently for for about 18 years and I
 
04:58:46.430 --> 04:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
know that that there's a misconception
 
04:58:49.590 --> 04:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
that we've heard in this committee a
 
04:58:52.670 --> 04:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
number of times that the agencies are
 
04:58:54.270 --> 04:58:54.280 align:start position:0%
kind of running a muck they can do
 
04:58:56.190 --> 04:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
anything they want to and they're doing
 
04:59:00.310 --> 04:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
it uh I reject that because I think that
 
04:59:04.230 --> 04:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
by and large the agencies are diligently
 
04:59:07.868 --> 04:59:07.878 align:start position:0%
in attempting to implement the statutes
 
04:59:10.990 --> 04:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
that we have enacted
 
04:59:13.310 --> 04:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
which is not to say that the agencies
 
04:59:15.430 --> 04:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
never overstep their Authority or
 
04:59:17.628 --> 04:59:17.638 align:start position:0%
whatever and representative goalie will
 
04:59:21.110 --> 04:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
remember when we had this bill a year or
 
04:59:25.350 --> 04:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
so ago with regard to the Food Service
 
04:59:27.788 --> 04:59:27.798 align:start position:0%
entity that was required to put a
 
04:59:31.230 --> 04:59:31.240 align:start position:0%
thousand gallon tank into the into their
 
04:59:33.230 --> 04:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
ground they they had been a like I think
 
04:59:35.350 --> 04:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
an ice cream shop before and they
 
04:59:36.628 --> 04:59:36.638 align:start position:0%
switching over
 
04:59:40.628 --> 04:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
to I think crabs and and and
 
04:59:43.510 --> 04:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
that type of thing uh and so for
 
04:59:46.990 --> 04:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
clamshack okay and they came in and they
 
04:59:49.390 --> 04:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
said you're you've got a public restroom
 
04:59:52.230 --> 04:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
now which you didn't have before um
 
04:59:53.990 --> 04:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
you're having people eat there and so
 
04:59:56.150 --> 04:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
forth and you're putting stuff into the
 
04:59:59.868 --> 04:59:59.878 align:start position:0%
ground that is harmful to the the you
 
05:00:02.750 --> 05:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
know the viability of the soil to absorb
 
05:00:05.390 --> 05:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
that stuff and harmful to the
 
05:00:07.670 --> 05:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
environment and they required them to
 
05:00:10.548 --> 05:00:10.558 align:start position:0%
put in a thousand gallon tank
 
05:00:12.510 --> 05:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
and that bill came to
 
05:00:16.750 --> 05:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
us and and I think a lot of us saw this
 
05:00:18.830 --> 05:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
as a mistake at the very least on the
 
05:00:23.510 --> 05:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
part of Dees and and also possibly an
 
05:00:25.510 --> 05:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
example of
 
05:00:29.510 --> 05:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
heavy-handedness um and uh and in
 
05:00:32.110 --> 05:00:32.120 align:start position:0%
pursuant to that experience there was a
 
05:00:34.030 --> 05:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
working group that was set up between
 
05:00:35.830 --> 05:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
Dees and
 
05:00:39.990 --> 05:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
HHS and I participate in that and those
 
05:00:43.190 --> 05:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
most people who were very experienced
 
05:00:44.708 --> 05:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
people who had been in the plumbing
 
05:00:47.948 --> 05:00:47.958 align:start position:0%
business or the regulatory end of things
 
05:00:51.190 --> 05:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
for years and years and they said we've
 
05:00:54.190 --> 05:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
never had a discussion like this before
 
05:00:55.628 --> 05:00:55.638 align:start position:0%
because they said you know the plumbing
 
05:00:58.628 --> 05:00:58.638 align:start position:0%
code says that uh and we the plumbing
 
05:01:01.750 --> 05:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
cone governs everything in the house and
 
05:01:04.548 --> 05:01:04.558 align:start position:0%
six feet of pipe coming out of the house
 
05:01:07.548 --> 05:01:07.558 align:start position:0%
and the the the the dees has a
 
05:01:10.708 --> 05:01:10.718 align:start position:0%
requirement that septic tanks and so
 
05:01:12.910 --> 05:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
forth and so on but there was a lot of
 
05:01:15.430 --> 05:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
unclarity with regard to what happens
 
05:01:19.110 --> 05:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
when the plumbing line and the thing get
 
05:01:22.628 --> 05:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
close together what governs them
 
05:01:25.070 --> 05:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
connecting up and transferring the
 
05:01:27.390 --> 05:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
material from the house to the to the
 
05:01:30.990 --> 05:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
ground and and that that working group
 
05:01:33.948 --> 05:01:33.958 align:start position:0%
under all this expert input came up with
 
05:01:35.548 --> 05:01:35.558 align:start position:0%
some very good
 
05:01:38.150 --> 05:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
suggestions and but the point is that I
 
05:01:40.910 --> 05:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
think that uh that having experienced
 
05:01:43.948 --> 05:01:43.958 align:start position:0%
the turnkey landfill situation in Dober
 
05:01:46.350 --> 05:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
where there were a lot of comments with
 
05:01:49.548 --> 05:01:49.558 align:start position:0%
regard to older issues and other issues
 
05:01:53.030 --> 05:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
um and the the dees kind of waved a hand
 
05:01:55.470 --> 05:01:55.480 align:start position:0%
to some degree and said these are all
 
05:01:58.430 --> 05:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
non gerain they're dismissed but when
 
05:02:01.270 --> 05:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
the citizenry was myself included a
 
05:02:03.510 --> 05:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
little bit later in the game got
 
05:02:05.830 --> 05:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
involved and reached out and protested
 
05:02:07.830 --> 05:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
about the the the way this thing was
 
05:02:11.510 --> 05:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
handled and the EPA found out about
 
05:02:16.830 --> 05:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
it they they said Dees you have screwed
 
05:02:18.390 --> 05:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
up to put it
 
05:02:22.230 --> 05:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
bluntly um and so I think this is an
 
05:02:25.750 --> 05:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity this the underlying Bill
 
05:02:29.708 --> 05:02:29.718 align:start position:0%
1521 is an opportunity for the for the
 
05:02:31.788 --> 05:02:31.798 align:start position:0%
input of the citizenry which may be
 
05:02:34.470 --> 05:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
uninformed in some instances or wrong in
 
05:02:36.548 --> 05:02:36.558 align:start position:0%
other instances but that doesn't mean
 
05:02:38.510 --> 05:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
that the citizens don't know anything
 
05:02:42.628 --> 05:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
about anything at any time and and I
 
05:02:45.788 --> 05:02:45.798 align:start position:0%
looked at the stuff that EPA uh the E
 
05:02:49.350 --> 05:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
the dees subsequently put out to us put
 
05:02:51.708 --> 05:02:51.718 align:start position:0%
out to the public there was a lot of
 
05:02:54.150 --> 05:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
very good input from the public I don't
 
05:02:55.788 --> 05:02:55.798 align:start position:0%
know whether anybody else has seen that
 
05:02:58.230 --> 05:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
document but in stford County we saw it
 
05:03:02.150 --> 05:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
anyway and the thing is that 1521 is an
 
05:03:05.868 --> 05:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us and I think we should
 
05:03:09.510 --> 05:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
we should take this up in and as CH as
 
05:03:11.910 --> 05:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
the shair knows and some of the longer
 
05:03:14.270 --> 05:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
serving members know we don't need a
 
05:03:17.350 --> 05:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
bill we don't need a bill we can take up
 
05:03:19.590 --> 05:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
any issue that a majority of the this
 
05:03:21.708 --> 05:03:21.718 align:start position:0%
committee wants to study and I think
 
05:03:24.910 --> 05:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
this is a a topic worthy of that study
 
05:03:26.628 --> 05:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
but I would like to see some of the
 
05:03:29.350 --> 05:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
stuff done now because if we put it all
 
05:03:32.590 --> 05:03:32.600 align:start position:0%
in a an interim study nothing will
 
05:03:34.190 --> 05:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
happen this year and I think some of
 
05:03:36.270 --> 05:03:36.280 align:start position:0%
this stuff needs to be done this year
 
05:03:38.990 --> 05:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
which means we have to consider it now
 
05:03:44.070 --> 05:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:47.230 --> 05:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
Indulgence looking at the if you want to
 
05:03:50.030 --> 05:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
include something for this year the part
 
05:03:53.030 --> 05:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
that would make sense to me would be to
 
05:03:57.230 --> 05:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
require that public comment be posted on
 
05:04:01.548 --> 05:04:01.558 align:start position:0%
the website that would be because I
 
05:04:03.830 --> 05:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
believe that can be done without
 
05:04:05.750 --> 05:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
interfering with the
 
05:04:08.708 --> 05:04:08.718 align:start position:0%
process they particularly written
 
05:04:11.470 --> 05:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
testimony should be posted there's no
 
05:04:15.110 --> 05:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
reason not to and I think that would be
 
05:04:17.510 --> 05:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
as you say I think that's extremely wise
 
05:04:20.590 --> 05:04:20.600 align:start position:0%
proposal Madam chair all
 
05:04:23.990 --> 05:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
right representative laus um just so I'm
 
05:04:25.310 --> 05:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
clear you're you're proposing from the
 
05:04:29.390 --> 05:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
original 1521 to take just section three
 
05:04:32.030 --> 05:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
or any other part of B basically section
 
05:04:36.110 --> 05:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
three okay because that is that is
 
05:04:41.070 --> 05:04:41.080 align:start position:0%
something that some agencies do in part
 
05:04:43.708 --> 05:04:43.718 align:start position:0%
but it uh like responding to public
 
05:04:45.350 --> 05:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
comment it's something that we would
 
05:04:49.110 --> 05:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
want every agency to do regularly okay
 
05:04:51.868 --> 05:04:51.878 align:start position:0%
and then followup follow really comment
 
05:04:54.070 --> 05:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
um to to uh representative Schmid's
 
05:04:55.750 --> 05:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
comment yeah I chaired the subcommittee
 
05:04:57.390 --> 05:04:57.400 align:start position:0%
on that greas strap issue is actually
 
05:05:00.310 --> 05:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
between conflict between DS and the
 
05:05:02.830 --> 05:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
building code review board and uh it
 
05:05:04.590 --> 05:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
showed that interim study can sometimes
 
05:05:07.470 --> 05:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
be useful we got them to actually fix
 
05:05:09.230 --> 05:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
the problem without statute through rul
 
05:05:11.670 --> 05:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
making and other things so worked out
 
05:05:13.910 --> 05:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
and it shows how glamorous this job is
 
05:05:15.750 --> 05:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
that I spent a number of meetings on
 
05:05:20.070 --> 05:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:23.548 --> 05:05:23.558 align:start position:0%
traps many years ago I chaired the fog
 
05:05:26.590 --> 05:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
committee or study committee fat oil and
 
05:05:29.750 --> 05:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
grease about restaurant output yellow
 
05:05:31.548 --> 05:05:31.558 align:start position:0%
grease Brown grease I don't know if any
 
05:05:34.310 --> 05:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
of you have ever had any contact even
 
05:05:36.548 --> 05:05:36.558 align:start position:0%
smelling Brown grease but there is
 
05:05:39.750 --> 05:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
hardly a more evil smell in the in in
 
05:05:42.070 --> 05:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
the universe than that for
 
05:05:44.390 --> 05:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt representative
 
05:05:46.270 --> 05:05:46.280 align:start position:0%
Simon you had a comment yes thank you
 
05:05:48.990 --> 05:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair um recognize the complexity
 
05:05:51.350 --> 05:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
of how this all integrates when we're
 
05:05:53.430 --> 05:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the whole process um I would
 
05:05:55.190 --> 05:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
just like to offer once again to the
 
05:05:57.070 --> 05:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
committee um if the committee will give
 
05:05:58.910 --> 05:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
me its Indulgence to take the next week
 
05:06:00.230 --> 05:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
look at the language and make some
 
05:06:01.868 --> 05:06:01.878 align:start position:0%
recommendations as opposed to trying to
 
05:06:04.070 --> 05:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
jam it into the next 10 minutes here in
 
05:06:06.430 --> 05:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
committee I'd be happy to do that work
 
05:06:08.310 --> 05:06:08.320 align:start position:0%
if that's
 
05:06:10.670 --> 05:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
acceptable we I think we should we need
 
05:06:13.708 --> 05:06:13.718 align:start position:0%
to give you some guidance because if we
 
05:06:15.590 --> 05:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
wait until next
 
05:06:18.470 --> 05:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
week admittedly we won't have the final
 
05:06:21.670 --> 05:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
language before then but we should have
 
05:06:24.190 --> 05:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
an a consensus at least on what it
 
05:06:26.548 --> 05:06:26.558 align:start position:0%
should include or what it should not
 
05:06:30.788 --> 05:06:30.798 align:start position:0%
include uh because we're this time we've
 
05:06:33.948 --> 05:06:33.958 align:start position:0%
got a week next week we will have
 
05:06:37.670 --> 05:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
the we will not have time if if I may I
 
05:06:39.670 --> 05:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
I think that the 90 days is the most
 
05:06:42.590 --> 05:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
problematic part at this point and I
 
05:06:44.868 --> 05:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
think um the interested parties are
 
05:06:47.270 --> 05:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
interested in they're okay with having
 
05:06:49.590 --> 05:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
that removed um so that we're not
 
05:06:51.990 --> 05:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
slowing down the process um so I think
 
05:06:53.030 --> 05:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
that would be something if we're going
 
05:06:55.830 --> 05:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
to if we're going to cut that seems like
 
05:06:57.150 --> 05:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
the most reasonable thing to cut at this
 
05:06:59.030 --> 05:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
particular point in
 
05:07:03.750 --> 05:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
time so your your suggestion is that we
 
05:07:06.548 --> 05:07:06.558 align:start position:0%
incorporate section three which is the
 
05:07:09.590 --> 05:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
publishing public comment because we
 
05:07:11.270 --> 05:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
already have a
 
05:07:15.430 --> 05:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
statutory um requirement that the
 
05:07:18.030 --> 05:07:18.040 align:start position:0%
agency Report with the
 
05:07:22.510 --> 05:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
final uh final rule the public comment
 
05:07:28.190 --> 05:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:32.070 --> 05:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
correct yeah um even Part B of of one I
 
05:07:34.070 --> 05:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
I would just I'd like to take a closer
 
05:07:35.788 --> 05:07:35.798 align:start position:0%
look at that um and have some
 
05:07:37.628 --> 05:07:37.638 align:start position:0%
conversations with a few people and just
 
05:07:39.548 --> 05:07:39.558 align:start position:0%
determine if there's something that
 
05:07:40.868 --> 05:07:40.878 align:start position:0%
could be done and I'm happy to keep the
 
05:07:42.868 --> 05:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
chair in the loop since you know more on
 
05:07:45.628 --> 05:07:45.638 align:start position:0%
this issue than I do um to not bring
 
05:07:46.628 --> 05:07:46.638 align:start position:0%
something back to the committee that
 
05:07:49.510 --> 05:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be agreeable um but I'd
 
05:07:51.190 --> 05:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
like to look at that particular section
 
05:07:56.430 --> 05:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:58.708 --> 05:07:58.718 align:start position:0%
well think I'm willing to work with
 
05:08:00.708 --> 05:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
anybody on this because I have a lot of
 
05:08:02.510 --> 05:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
respect for this committee and having
 
05:08:04.548 --> 05:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
served on a long time but even this
 
05:08:07.030 --> 05:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
group of people with the possible
 
05:08:09.270 --> 05:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
exception of our of our subs today who
 
05:08:12.310 --> 05:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
are for whom this is all brand new um
 
05:08:13.750 --> 05:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is there are a lot
 
05:08:15.750 --> 05:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
of experienced and smart people on this
 
05:08:18.310 --> 05:08:18.320 align:start position:0%
committee that have shown me that we can
 
05:08:20.110 --> 05:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
we can get results when we put our minds
 
05:08:23.990 --> 05:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
to it so let's let's get at this any
 
05:08:26.948 --> 05:08:26.958 align:start position:0%
does anyone else have any opinion on
 
05:08:30.070 --> 05:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
this representative gold thank you madam
 
05:08:31.788 --> 05:08:31.798 align:start position:0%
chair I was going to volunteer to help I
 
05:08:34.430 --> 05:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
think that rep Simon's suggestion makes
 
05:08:38.110 --> 05:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
perfect sense and he's much um he's in a
 
05:08:39.830 --> 05:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
much better position than I am to take
 
05:08:41.470 --> 05:08:41.480 align:start position:0%
the charge on that but I would offer any
 
05:08:43.788 --> 05:08:43.798 align:start position:0%
assistance if he needs any tracking down
 
05:08:45.750 --> 05:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
comments from people or what have you
 
05:08:47.510 --> 05:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
and I think the plan sounds like a solid
 
05:08:49.830 --> 05:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
plan representative Bara okay I hate to
 
05:08:52.470 --> 05:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
be the wet blanket in all this but I'm
 
05:08:55.070 --> 05:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
going to be you know we have people who
 
05:08:56.990 --> 05:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
want to be on the committee or want to
 
05:08:58.830 --> 05:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
help but have no experience with the
 
05:09:01.430 --> 05:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
rule making process or experience with
 
05:09:04.990 --> 05:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
Jael car so I think that it's fine if
 
05:09:06.868 --> 05:09:06.878 align:start position:0%
representative Simon wants to work with
 
05:09:08.590 --> 05:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
someone but I think that it should
 
05:09:10.788 --> 05:09:10.798 align:start position:0%
involve I hate to do this to you but I
 
05:09:13.350 --> 05:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
think you should involve you and
 
05:09:17.350 --> 05:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
I and maybe um doesn't hurt my feelings
 
05:09:18.510 --> 05:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
I just didn't want to volunteer you for
 
05:09:20.470 --> 05:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
something else I know but I'm I'm
 
05:09:22.310 --> 05:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
willing to take a look at it involve
 
05:09:24.350 --> 05:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
myself and involve um the chair and
 
05:09:27.750 --> 05:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
involve someone from the office because
 
05:09:30.150 --> 05:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
I think that that's
 
05:09:32.590 --> 05:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
critical I that's the way it is I'm
 
05:09:35.708 --> 05:09:35.718 align:start position:0%
sorry well if I may I I think that Mr
 
05:09:37.670 --> 05:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
osterhout wasn't going to escape me and
 
05:09:39.990 --> 05:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
I think he was knowing that in the no
 
05:09:42.948 --> 05:09:42.958 align:start position:0%
it's not really no no this is not really
 
05:09:45.990 --> 05:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
OPC this this section of the B yeah he's
 
05:09:47.510 --> 05:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
waving off he wants to make sure that he
 
05:09:48.628 --> 05:09:48.638 align:start position:0%
that I know I'm not going to be
 
05:09:51.708 --> 05:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
bothering him but uh okay well Mr moral
 
05:09:53.470 --> 05:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
and I can become friends I'm fine I'm
 
05:09:54.708 --> 05:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
fine with that as well I would
 
05:09:57.430 --> 05:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely volunteer to do that I think
 
05:10:01.310 --> 05:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
there are hidden things here that uh not
 
05:10:03.868 --> 05:10:03.878 align:start position:0%
intentionally hidden but ramifications
 
05:10:05.868 --> 05:10:05.878 align:start position:0%
that most people would not
 
05:10:07.990 --> 05:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
realize all
 
05:10:09.868 --> 05:10:09.878 align:start position:0%
right if I
 
05:10:15.310 --> 05:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
okay so let me restate what I think the
 
05:10:19.750 --> 05:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
um the the action would be
 
05:10:22.230 --> 05:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
representative Simon will work with
 
05:10:24.070 --> 05:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt with his
 
05:10:27.670 --> 05:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
experience and director moral to
 
05:10:30.590 --> 05:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
incorporate part three as much as
 
05:10:34.670 --> 05:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
possible and possibly some other section
 
05:10:37.030 --> 05:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
of House Bill
 
05:10:42.150 --> 05:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
1521 to be amended in to House Bill 1622
 
05:10:44.590 --> 05:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
is that agree is that what you
 
05:10:46.670 --> 05:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
understand what do you accept that
 
05:10:53.510 --> 05:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:56.510 --> 05:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
committee yeah yes I just
 
05:10:59.750 --> 05:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
wanted re I think having two people with
 
05:11:02.868 --> 05:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
director moral should be able to do
 
05:11:06.230 --> 05:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
something you will be under strict
 
05:11:09.510 --> 05:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
scrutiny all right is that is that
 
05:11:11.750 --> 05:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
agreeable to the rest of the committee
 
05:11:15.750 --> 05:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
yes yes okay any objections Speak now or
 
05:11:18.548 --> 05:11:18.558 align:start position:0%
you'll get squashed not an objection but
 
05:11:19.750 --> 05:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
having those people and having it
 
05:11:21.150 --> 05:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
reviewed before and it's good what I
 
05:11:22.910 --> 05:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
don't want is to come on next Wednesday
 
05:11:25.948 --> 05:11:25.958 align:start position:0%
and have things blow up I'll drink to
 
05:11:29.430 --> 05:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
that yes it will be my my every effort
 
05:11:30.830 --> 05:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
will go into making sure that doesn't
 
05:11:32.830 --> 05:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
happen uh representative lakus and I
 
05:11:34.670 --> 05:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
will try to get whatever we've come up
 
05:11:37.628 --> 05:11:37.638 align:start position:0%
with out to the committee before next
 
05:11:38.868 --> 05:11:38.878 align:start position:0%
Wednesday so that you can review it
 
05:11:42.350 --> 05:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
before hand that that'll be my goal yes
 
05:11:43.670 --> 05:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
yes and this
 
05:11:48.590 --> 05:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
is um yeah we're up against the a
 
05:11:51.470 --> 05:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
deadline at this point and I don't want
 
05:11:54.948 --> 05:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
to jeopardize the other stuff in 1622
 
05:11:57.230 --> 05:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
which is why I was suggesting you know
 
05:11:59.270 --> 05:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
part three
 
05:11:59.280 --> 05:12:01.070 align:start position:0%
part three
seems

05:12:01.070 --> 05:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
seems
 
05:12:03.230 --> 05:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh the other stuff I'm going
 
05:12:05.990 --> 05:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
to be very skeptical at but we will
 
05:12:09.548 --> 05:12:09.558 align:start position:0%
we'll see what we can do Madam chair yes
 
05:12:11.430 --> 05:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
this is a procedural question is it
 
05:12:14.390 --> 05:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
possible to pass the amendment as it
 
05:12:16.830 --> 05:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
stands in front of us and then do an
 
05:12:19.470 --> 05:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
additional Amendment next week
 
05:12:22.110 --> 05:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
sure that would kind of give that safety
 
05:12:24.230 --> 05:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
net that this piece would be in
 
05:12:26.470 --> 05:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
place we might as well finish it since
 
05:12:30.548 --> 05:12:30.558 align:start position:0%
there's a motion on the floor so um okay
 
05:12:34.310 --> 05:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
we will pass this amendment then the
 
05:12:36.230 --> 05:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
whatever representative Schmidt and
 
05:12:38.110 --> 05:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
Simon work out would
 
05:12:42.868 --> 05:12:42.878 align:start position:0%
be to the bill as amended we can do that
 
05:12:44.990 --> 05:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
agreed okay
 
05:12:49.788 --> 05:12:49.798 align:start position:0%
any and let's um any other comments or
 
05:12:51.910 --> 05:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
concerns all right in that case the
 
05:12:54.270 --> 05:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
motion is to adopt Amendment
 
05:12:57.750 --> 05:12:57.760 align:start position:0%

05:13:39.750 --> 05:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment we will recess the executive
 
05:13:42.230 --> 05:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
 
05:13:45.750 --> 05:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
1622 for Representatives Simon and
 
05:13:51.430 --> 05:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
Schmidt to evaluate what parts of 1521
 
05:13:52.830 --> 05:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
they want to
 
05:13:52.840 --> 05:13:55.110 align:start position:0%
they want to
include

05:13:55.110 --> 05:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
include
 
05:13:59.750 --> 05:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
and develop an amendment that does
 
05:14:02.510 --> 05:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
that and for everyone's
 
05:14:07.190 --> 05:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
information House Bill
 
05:14:09.910 --> 05:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
1095 has an amendment that is not yet
 
05:14:12.788 --> 05:14:12.798 align:start position:0%
ready and that is also recessed to next
 
05:14:16.310 --> 05:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
week um representative
 
05:14:20.230 --> 05:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
groto um is going to be
 
05:14:23.110 --> 05:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
taking some time to go over that
 
05:14:25.628 --> 05:14:25.638 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh we will not be voting on it
 
05:14:27.310 --> 05:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
today because it's we don't have the
 
05:14:29.750 --> 05:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
final language but anyone who has
 
05:14:31.510 --> 05:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
questions or concerns about that
 
05:14:37.750 --> 05:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:41.270 --> 05:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
stay and and I think with that those who
 
05:14:43.390 --> 05:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
don't have questions or concerns about
 
05:14:47.708 --> 05:14:47.718 align:start position:0%
how the amendment to House Bill 1095 are
 
05:14:51.270 --> 05:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh are off the hook for
 
05:14:54.230 --> 05:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
today and they that will give them
 
05:14:56.628 --> 05:14:56.638 align:start position:0%
plenty of time to write their committee
 
05:14:59.150 --> 05:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
reports is there
 
05:15:02.390 --> 05:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
um a reason to discuss what's going on
 
05:15:04.788 --> 05:15:04.798 align:start position:0%
in 1271 in context although it's kind of
 
05:15:07.190 --> 05:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
separate because pieces were taken out
 
05:15:09.070 --> 05:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
if and I don't have language for that
 
05:15:12.070 --> 05:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
either I'm waiting for so that's U we
 
05:15:13.470 --> 05:15:13.480 align:start position:0%
will have
 
05:15:15.750 --> 05:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
to I'll send that language out when I
 
05:15:17.150 --> 05:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
get it I ask to have it by end of
 
05:15:21.470 --> 05:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
business Thursday it was complicated so
 
05:15:23.430 --> 05:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
okay I don't know if there's any reason
 
05:15:25.750 --> 05:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
for me to stay now I guess is the
 
05:15:29.390 --> 05:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
