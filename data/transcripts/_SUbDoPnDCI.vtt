00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
other lists of reportable communicable
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
diseases to the state thank you
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
senator daniels
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
how are these tests administered are
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
they on a voluntary basis where somebody
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
would have to ask for it or is the
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
department going to be out there
 
00:50:20.549 --> 00:50:20.559 align:start position:0%
promoting it uh through schools or some
 
00:50:20.559 --> 00:50:21.510 align:start position:0%
promoting it uh through schools or some
other

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
medium to to get to the people
 
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
great um thank you for that question so
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
these are completely voluntary no one is
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
forced to take a test we are making them
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
available potentially in places like
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
schools so that people who are um who
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
children who have symptoms or even
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
beforehand parents can have that so that
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
it's ready to go if their child is
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
symptomatic they can do the testing in
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
the convenience of their own home the
 
00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
way it works is you get a little kit um
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
you may have the option of doing a
 
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
zoomed visit with the with a health care
 
00:50:56.309 --> 00:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
provider but you don't need to do that
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
but if you have questions on how to do
 
00:50:59.829 --> 00:50:59.839 align:start position:0%
the self-administration how to spit in
 
00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
the little tube it offers that ability
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
to have someone walk through that with
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
you but you don't have to do it and then
 
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
as i noted to senator rosenwald you pack
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
up the test you put it in an envelope
 
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
you send it to the laboratory then the
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
laboratory notifies the individual of
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
the result
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
i understand the problem with the sound
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
in the remote rooms
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
is that we are not talking close enough
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
to the microphone to be heard
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
so if you could
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
set your microphone on the
 
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
side of your book
 
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
and speak directly into it when
 
00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:44.069 align:start position:0%
and speak directly into it when
you

00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
want to speak
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions on fis
 
00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:56.559 align:start position:0%
move the item
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%

department to promote testing
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
through the schools
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
well we will certainly make people aware
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
that that option is open but schools
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
this is also voluntary on the par on the
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
basis of the schools the schools do not
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
have to participate if they don't want
 
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%
to we similarly have other very
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
voluntary testing processes that we do
 
00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
through schools but districts make that
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%

um i understand these are the extra
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
federal medicaid match funds
 
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
and my question is
 
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
last fiscal
 
00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.950 align:start position:0%
last fiscal
department

00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:19.430 align:start position:0%
department
lapsed

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
lapsed
 
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
tens of millions of dollars
 
00:58:23.349 --> 00:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
of general funds
 
00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
that were supplanted by this extra
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
federal money
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
is the department planning to do that
 
00:58:30.799 --> 00:58:31.750 align:start position:0%
is the department planning to do that
again

00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year or considering
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:38.079 --> 00:58:38.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
purposefully try to lapse
 
00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
these dollars
 
00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:47.839 align:start position:0%
we did try to accept what we
 
00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
could estimate we were going to receive
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
last fiscal year
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
i have still not been able to resolve
 
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
financially in the department is
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
estimating revenue
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
we are finally at a place that we
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
estimate expenditures extremely well
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
every area the department does it the
 
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
same way
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
but revenues are a little bit more
 
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.990 align:start position:0%
but revenues are a little bit more
complicated

00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
we just
 
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
started a process to issue an rfp
 
00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:12.630 align:start position:0%
started a process to issue an rfp
to

00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
be able to do that better in the coming
 
00:59:15.599 --> 00:59:17.349 align:start position:0%
be able to do that better in the coming
biennium

00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:59:17.359 --> 00:59:18.870 align:start position:0%
biennium
so

00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
i can't tell you for sure that we won't
 
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
still lapse some revenue but we are
 
00:59:26.069 --> 00:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
attempting in the best way that we have
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
available to us right now
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
to estimate the enhanced fmap and accept
 
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
it into the budget
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead thank you
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
the medicaid caseloads are still really
 
00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:42.870 align:start position:0%
the medicaid caseloads are still really
high

00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
high
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
because of the extended public health
 
00:59:49.589 --> 00:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
did we account for that in our
 
00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:54.549 align:start position:0%
did we account for that in our
budget

00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
did we appropriate enough to cover all
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
of the extra spending
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
which would allow you to lapse this
 
01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.150 align:start position:0%
which would allow you to lapse this
revenue

01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:04.870 align:start position:0%
revenue
so

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
no we appropriated the additional
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
expenditures through 1231 i believe and
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
so that's why we're accepting these
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
funds which are creating an
 
01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
appropriation to continue to pay for
 
01:00:16.559 --> 01:00:18.309 align:start position:0%
appropriation to continue to pay for
those

01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%

01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
tma vallencourt cfo for the department
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
of education
 
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
my question was
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
how are the
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
non-public schools
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
going to receive this
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
these dollars
 
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so i i think for context it's
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
helpful to understand that this is a
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
second iteration of the ian's program
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
eans one or carissa eens
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
what was just recently administered
 
01:05:15.069 --> 01:05:15.079 align:start position:0%
and under all there is a second
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
tranchaphones called r-beans so it will
 
01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:20.559 align:start position:0%
be administered substantially similar to
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
carissa ins the non-public schools that
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
are selected to participate
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
must be demonstrate their eligibility
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
and proactively apply they must
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
demonstrate their eligibility by showing
 
01:05:35.589 --> 01:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
a substantial proportion of students who
 
01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
are low income as well
 
01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
significant impact of the covid19
 
01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
pandemic the agency submitted an
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
application to the u.s department of
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
education with metrics for those these
 
01:05:50.549 --> 01:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
two criteria which was recently approved
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
and we received the funds
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
on 10 25.
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
so the non-public schools will in fact
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
have an application process that they
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
need to go through that's correct okay
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh could i have a motion oh
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair could you tell us how
 
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
many schools are likely to receive these
 
01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.630 align:start position:0%
many schools are likely to receive these
funds

01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
so there were 48 non-public schools
 
01:06:18.069 --> 01:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
deemed eligible and chosen and who chose
 
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
to participate in carissa ins but again
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
eligibility is based on their
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
self-reported data in their applications
 
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
so that gives us a guide post but
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
that number could be different
 
01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:32.799 align:start position:0%
for our beans
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks madam chair are there any
 
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
further questions said d'alessandro
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
first of all thanks so much for you for
 
01:06:40.799 --> 01:06:41.589 align:start position:0%
first of all thanks so much for you for
coming

01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
coming
 
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
but it's it seems there are a couple of
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
things here that
 
01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.670 align:start position:0%
things here that
senator

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
senator
 
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
well you're on but you're not close
 
01:06:49.280 --> 01:07:03.109 align:start position:0%
well you're on but you're not close
enough

01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
okay you're good
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of things on here
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
that that give me pause because of the
 
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
fact that they're an ongoing expense
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
that's going to have to be maintained
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
for example improving ventilation
 
01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:16.069 align:start position:0%
for example improving ventilation
systems

01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:07:17.589 --> 01:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
those are going to have to be maintained
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
over a long period of time
 
01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
are they not
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
so that that is an explicitly federally
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
allowable use
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
and of course these funds are only
 
01:07:31.029 --> 01:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
available for obligation through the end
 
01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
of the performance period so their
 
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
federal funds when they run out they run
 
01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:36.710 align:start position:0%
federal funds when they run out they run
out

01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
and that's the same situation with
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
leasing additional space
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
it seems to me once you've made it a
 
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
decision to lease additional space isn't
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
there a contractual relationship that's
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
usually associated with that that
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
extends over a period of time or is all
 
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
are is all of this done on an annual
 
01:07:57.270 --> 01:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
basis so that period of time must be
 
01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
within the performance period and for
 
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
our beans that's through federal fiscal
 
01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
year 24.
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
so the space
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
that you indicated is very uncommon
 
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
nationwide and in new hampshire in
 
01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:10.950 align:start position:0%
nationwide and in new hampshire in
particular

01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's typically to facilitate for social
 
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
distancing in classrooms but again that
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
could only be
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
utilized through the performance period
 
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
in carissa ends we saw the the vast
 
01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
majority of expenditures around
 
01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
items like
 
01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:31.910 align:start position:0%
items like
ppe

01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
just one further question
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
but but these things have an ongoing
 
01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.910 align:start position:0%
but but these things have an ongoing
situation

01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
and if you've made a commitment to do it
 
01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
for a limited time what happens
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
when that time runs out
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
so if
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
there are additional needs in response
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
to the kova 19 pandemic
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
after the performance period of our
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
beans expires then those would not be
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
supported by existing federal funds
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman you're quite
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
welcome are there any other questions
 
01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.510 align:start position:0%
welcome are there any other questions
on

01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
21 324 yes senator gaiden
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your excellent
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
presentation by the way thank you um
 
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
is this the same program or a program
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
equivalent to it available to our public
 
01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:25.990 align:start position:0%
equivalent to it available to our public
schools

01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
so this is a separate program from that
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
serving public schools so in the first
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
package cares in 2020 there was a
 
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
requirement as there is with esea
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
programs and ida programs for public
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
schools to provide equitable services to
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
non-public school students and teachers
 
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
from their allocation
 
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:46.789 align:start position:0%
from their allocation
in

01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
in carissa and arp the congress decided
 
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
to create a separate program that is
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
directly administered by state education
 
01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
agencies as opposed to having
 
01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
a portion a proportionate share of the
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
non-public schools allocations spent on
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
participating non-public schools and in
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
fact i think it's helpful to note that
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
school districts in the state have
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
received over 540 million dollars across
 
01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
six different programs and these three
 
01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
different legislative packages
 
01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
assistant with the feedback that we've
 
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
received from school districts thank you
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none will the clerk call the role
 
01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.149 align:start position:0%
seeing none will the clerk call the role
please

01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%

okay thank you very much go ahead
 
01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
senator thank you madam chair i have a
 
01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
number of questions on this item if
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
you'll indulge me i will thank you um
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
first i'd
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
curious how you arrived at the amount
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
of 17 million and change
 
01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.070 align:start position:0%
of 17 million and change
how

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
how did that number
 
01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
certainly uh senator i i think what we
 
01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
were aiming for is to be able to
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
launch a pilot program where we would
 
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
see somewhere between one thousand and
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
fifteen hundred
 
01:12:58.320 --> 01:12:59.350 align:start position:0%
fifteen hundred
student

01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
take advantage of a program such as this
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh and that that total comes to around
 
01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
15 million dollars roughly speaking
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
because there would be an average there
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
and the remaining funds would be used
 
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
over the course of the three or four
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
years of the program for to administer
 
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
the program
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
allocate a portion of the funds
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
to individuals who are most affected
 
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
and so my question is why only a portion
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
what portion and why not a hundred
 
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
percent being the portion certainly i
 
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
think that the idea that we had with
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
this program was sort of twofold one is
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
to put
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the funding so let's say i
 
01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
think it was 10 million dollars that
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for individuals who
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
are at 80 percent or lower of the uh of
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
the area media income
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
and that would be the first component of
 
01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
the program that would be launched and
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
made available
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
the second remaining amount
 
01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
of roughly let's say 5 million dollars
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
launched later in the summer and the
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
target would be students that are
 
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
graduating this coming spring
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
and giving them incentive to stay in the
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
state and take jobs
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
in with new hampshire employers
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you and um
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
what are the industries that you're
 
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
proposing to run this
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
program in and how are they arrived at
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
so at this point this program is seen as
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
sort of a foundational component of our
 
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
workforce recruitment effort and so we
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
have not specifically designated any
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
industries or any sectors here uh we are
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're aware of the fact that there
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
really is no industry or sector in new
 
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire that is not
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
experiencing a labor shortage right now
 
01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.270 align:start position:0%
experiencing a labor shortage right now
um

01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
so you're probably aware that we have a
 
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
state loan repayment program
 
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
that we allocate general funds to
 
01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
for health care workers this budget
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
appropriated about half as much money to
 
01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:21.750 align:start position:0%
appropriated about half as much money to
it

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
as the last budget
 
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
but we could
 
01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.390 align:start position:0%
but we could
all

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
all the requests
 
01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
to what extent will health care
 
01:15:35.669 --> 01:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
get the money
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
that you're proposing
 
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
well i i think the health care industry
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
probably is among the the most
 
01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:45.189 align:start position:0%
probably is among the the most
impacted

01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh industries right now obviously in the
 
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
state as it relates to being able to
 
01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
recruit and retain workforce i do think
 
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
that this would be a very popular
 
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
program for those industries
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
i'm also aware that
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
this is foundational in nature as i had
 
01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:00.709 align:start position:0%
this is foundational in nature as i had
mentioned

01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
i think other opportunities to continue
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
to find ways to specifically target
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
industries such as healthcare but we've
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
sort of brought this forward in a pilot
 
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
sort of format in order to be able to
 
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
determine the workability of this and
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
the effectiveness of it
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
before we started targeting specific
 
01:16:20.239 --> 01:16:21.669 align:start position:0%
before we started targeting specific
industries

01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
industries
 
01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
but this is
 
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
one time money isn't it it's 17 million
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
so it's a pilot
 
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
but how would you propose
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
funding it on an ongoing basis
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
if a thousand students or 1500 students
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
cost 17 million dollars once
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
well i mean senator that would be part
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
of the ongoing policy
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
decision making that we'd all be making
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
looking forward this is you know this is
 
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
something the legislature has looked at
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
in the past in previous iterations a
 
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
version of this type of
 
01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.950 align:start position:0%
version of this type of
program

01:16:58.950 --> 01:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
and whether that is worthy of ongoing
 
01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
additional federal investment assuming
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
if you know because the harpa funds are
 
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
still available through the end of 2024
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to make more investments of
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
those funds or if we wanted to find some
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
availability of in-state funds to
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
continue that program that's a decision
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
that we would all have to make at that
 
01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:19.990 align:start position:0%
that we would all have to make at that
point

01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
i have two more questions
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
can i hang on hang on just a moment
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
ma'am i'm sorry there are no
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
nothing can be raised above your head
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you
 
01:17:42.149 --> 01:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
um how
 
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
how long a work commitment are you
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
proposing will it be similar to the
 
01:17:50.229 --> 01:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
state loan repayment program it's four
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
years would be the total commitment
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
under the program
 
01:17:54.159 --> 01:17:55.110 align:start position:0%
under the program
finally

01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
finally
 
01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:56.790 align:start position:0%
finally
how

01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
how are you going to measure success
 
01:17:59.120 --> 01:17:59.910 align:start position:0%
how are you going to measure success
what

01:17:59.910 --> 01:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
specific parameters do you have
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
well i think first and foremost would of
 
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
course be the number of employees that
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
are still in the program at the end of
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
the program i think it's pretty
 
01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:14.310 align:start position:0%
the program i think it's pretty
common

01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
common
 
01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:15.510 align:start position:0%
common
assessment

01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
in the workforce area that if you're
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
able to hold on to an individual for a
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
period of three plus years
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
generally they their inclination is to
 
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
stay with that employer with in the area
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
that they're in
 
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
so that's a little bit of the thought
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
process there and we'll see or when we
 
01:18:32.229 --> 01:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
get to the end of this where things
 
01:18:32.239 --> 01:18:34.790 align:start position:0%
get to the end of this where things
stand

01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative leishman
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair and just a follow-up
 
01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
to uh senator rosenwald's question
 
01:18:45.669 --> 01:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
you say in here and i was a little
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
puzzled by your response that you're not
 
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
quite sure who may be administering this
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
but you
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
point out that you intend to partner
 
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
with another agency or entity could you
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
tell us
 
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
who that might be his business finance
 
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
administration bfa would be the
 
01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
administrator of this program
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
yes senator gaiden thank you madam chair
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
could you go into some depth about what
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
you mean by disproportionately affected
 
01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
by covid
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
well i can let chase uh get into that a
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
little bit more but it has to do with
 
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
the federal eligibility components of
 
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
the funding that we're using for this
 
01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:29.590 align:start position:0%
the funding that we're using for this
program

01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
you could just press it once there we go
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
senator guida yes the
 
01:19:40.149 --> 01:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
disproportionately impacted standard is
 
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
established by the american rescue plan
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
act um and the
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
targeting of this
 
01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
fund to those at a certain percentage or
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
lower of the ami helps meet that
 
01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:55.030 align:start position:0%
lower of the ami helps meet that
criteria

01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:57.189 --> 01:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
follow-up ami meaning adjusted median
 
01:19:58.709 --> 01:19:58.719 align:start position:0%
income area media
 
01:19:58.719 --> 01:19:59.669 align:start position:0%
income area media
okay

01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
 
01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:02.950 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
so

01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
what we're establishing here
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
is an incentive
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
i mean the commissioner can also jump in
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
but i think it's an incentive more
 
01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
focused on student debt relief needs as
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to specifically income it's just
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
meet certain requirements or eligibility
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
standards for use of these funds it's
 
01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.270 align:start position:0%
standards for use of these funds it's
it's

01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
called upon entities or states like ours
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
to have
 
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
requirements or areas of focus like this
 
01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
when using these funds in this fashion
 
01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes thank you so excuse me
 
01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
could you move your microphone closer
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
there there seem to be some issues with
 
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
hearing okay thank you
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:51.110 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
so

01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:53.669 --> 01:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
supposing a person
 
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
takes these funds for a year or two of
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
college and then decides not to finish
 
01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:00.639 align:start position:0%
is there any mechanism in place to re to
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
claw those back or have we just wasted
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
the money
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
so i think the details of the program uh
 
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
some of you worked out with bfa as we
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
move forward but the current thinking
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
is to not necessarily advance funds
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
before reaching certain milestones of
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
work eligibility so the hope would be to
 
01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
avoid having to claw back funds based on
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
how the program itself would be
 
01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:23.990 align:start position:0%
how the program itself would be
structured

01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
structured
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
senator daniels
 
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
i just want to express some concerns
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
that i have and commissioner i know that
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
you were part of a study committee a
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
couple terms
 
01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
ago by over
 
01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
100 training
 
01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:44.709 align:start position:0%
100 training
courses

01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
courses
 
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
i go around now and there are help
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
wanted signs everywhere
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
for employers this program is
 
01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
specifically designated towards the
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
latter we're
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
we're hoping to be able to do is attract
 
01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.070 align:start position:0%
we're hoping to be able to do is attract
students

01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
people who have received certifications
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
or degrees either here in new hampshire
 
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
or elsewhere to come here and take jobs
 
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
with new hampshire employers in order to
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
get this fund these funding you have to
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that you've taken a job with
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire employer and that
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
you've been able to in that you've
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
stayed in that job during the period the
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
term of the of the benefit
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
so it's aimed at specifically getting
 
01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
people here to fill a lot of those jobs
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
and you know when we look at um the
 
01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
demographics the long-term uh
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
sustainability of a workforce there is
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
obviously um an inclination for towards
 
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
people who are early at earlier stages
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
in their careers so that's sort of the
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
thought process with this particular
 
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
program i know on the on the training
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
stuff we you and i have spoken about
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
that over many years
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
there may be some programs that we are
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
able to design and bring forward
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
and we can have that discussion at that
 
01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
point as to how we want to handle that
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
in sort of concert with other programs
 
01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:56.639 align:start position:0%
that are already existing in the state
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
follow up yes go ahead uh in finance we
 
01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
seem to have an unwritten rule that we
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
do not use one-time money for operating
 
01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:07.669 align:start position:0%
do not use one-time money for operating
costs

01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
the money that you're talking about is
 
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
basically a four-year
 
01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:13.110 align:start position:0%
basically a four-year
program

01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:23:14.070 --> 01:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:23:15.870 --> 01:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
people go so so where is the
 
01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:17.430 align:start position:0%
people go so so where is the
sustainability

01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
sustainability
 
01:23:19.990 --> 01:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
in keeping people in that job if you're
 
01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
not going to go back to the federal pool
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
or the state pool for more for more
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
money to supplement what an employer is
 
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
getting yeah i i i
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
true i think that the point though is
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
that and what we expect with this
 
01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:33.110 align:start position:0%
that and what we expect with this
program

01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
is that we would see obligation of these
 
01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
resources pretty quickly
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
i think that it would be a popular
 
01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
program to be able to help students
 
01:23:45.189 --> 01:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
and adults in a lot of cases offset or
 
01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
reduce the debt load that they're
 
01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
carrying in exchange for taking a job
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
for a period of time in new hampshire
 
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
i would expect that most of these
 
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
resources would be used up before the
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
end of 2022
 
01:23:58.709 --> 01:23:58.719 align:start position:0%
and that we would just be managing the
 
01:23:58.719 --> 01:23:59.910 align:start position:0%
and that we would just be managing the
program

01:23:59.910 --> 01:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
as it is right now going forward over
 
01:24:04.149 --> 01:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
the next four years as i mentioned to
 
01:24:05.669 --> 01:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald if at the end of that
 
01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
period of time it's the decision of all
 
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
of us
 
01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
to continue some version of this we
 
01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
would have to find resources that are
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
available to us to continue it or not
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
but there wouldn't be any ongoing cost
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily beyond the reimbursements
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
that would happen in processing those
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursements for the people who apply
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
for and receive the funding in 2022.
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
one final question yes go ahead um so so
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
why should people be entitled to student
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
debt relief
 
01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:36.070 align:start position:0%
debt relief
now

01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
but those who graduated say last year or
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
the year before or those who are
 
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
graduating three or four years from now
 
01:24:47.189 --> 01:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
won't be able for won't be
 
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
eligible for it
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
agree and this is one of those programs
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
where we absolutely cannot design a
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
program that's all things to all people
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
i think what we're trying to do is
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that a program that has a
 
01:24:59.910 --> 01:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
student debt relief component to it tied
 
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
to a work requirement in new hampshire
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
would uh would provide enough of an
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
impetus to get somewhere between 1 000
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
and 1500 new non-existent workers into
 
01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
employment system
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
senator guida oh i'm sorry senator guida
 
01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
i'm over in the corner here matt i know
 
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
i know well you had your chance before
 
01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
so a question
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
as to why businesses themselves
 
01:25:37.110 --> 01:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
can't provide incentives to employers it
 
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:38.719 align:start position:0%
seems to me as though with this program
 
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
the government is stepping in to pay the
 
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
costs that businesses traditionally pay
 
01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
for recruiting their own workers and for
 
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
that reason i'm i'm prone to object to
 
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:46.870 align:start position:0%
that reason i'm i'm prone to object to
it

01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
i i think that that may be the case with
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of employers a lot of larger
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
employers i am aware of are doing some
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
pretty substantial things to attract
 
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
workforce including relocation costs and
 
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth but i don't think
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's universally the case with all
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
employers in the state and a lot of our
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
employers are as you as you well know
 
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
senators smaller employers who may not
 
01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
have the resources at this point in time
 
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
given what we've been through over the
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
last year or so to be able to make that
 
01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
investment but they still need the uh
 
01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
the resources they still need that staff
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
as a resource to continue to advance
 
01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
their their business
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
so at this point it does seem like it
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
would be a a good moment in time if
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
there were one to make an investment
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
such as this
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
yes you may i would submit that
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
if we have a four year or two year
 
01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
training program that an employer has a
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
need for an employee now that this is
 
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
not going to help the situation it's
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
intended to based on the covered
 
01:26:43.110 --> 01:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
pandemics we expect to end at some point
 
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
so there's a disconnect for me in four
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
years or two years down the road paying
 
01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
for a college or an associate degree or
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
a technical degree
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
for a need that's now that an employer
 
01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
will benefit from two or four years down
 
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
the road well just to clarify this would
 
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
be this would be for students right now
 
01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
and they would enter the workforce and
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
then over a period of four years there
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
would be a reimbursement on an annual
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
basis basis to those
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
employees or to to the debt holders
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
for the in exchange for their employment
 
01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
final question yes so what do we then
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
tell those who attempt to qualify and
 
01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:21.590 align:start position:0%
tell those who attempt to qualify and
don't

01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
that because for some arbitrary reason
 
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to pay back your
 
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
college loan
 
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
but because we chose somebody
 
01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
that's i mean again this is a program
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
and one of those programs where there's
 
01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
probably not enough money
 
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of student debt that's out
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
there right now particularly in new
 
01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire to cover every single
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:53.110 --> 01:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald thank you madam chair
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
i don't feel that i have enough
 
01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
information to vote on this item one way
 
01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
or another so i'd like to move that
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
we've laid on the table
 
01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
and asked the department
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
or gopher to come back

at the next meeting with a fleshed-out
 
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:12.400 align:start position:0%

item up if it's a late item
 
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
simply because of
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
the very recent history of the executive
 
01:32:31.679 --> 01:32:32.709 align:start position:0%
the very recent history of the executive
council

01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
council
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
adding a controversial late item to
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
bypass public notice
 
01:32:37.679 --> 01:32:38.550 align:start position:0%
bypass public notice
and

01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
if we don't need to uh discuss this
 
01:32:42.629 --> 01:32:42.639 align:start position:0%

01:32:54.310 --> 01:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
this was into das in plenty of time it
 
01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:56.550 align:start position:0%
this was into das in plenty of time it
got

01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
shuffled under some paperwork which i
 
01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
can't imagine dis having any paperwork
 
01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
but the result was
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
that it
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
had to enter
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
our agenda as a late item
 
01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
because of the problems encountered in
 
01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:15.030 align:start position:0%
because of the problems encountered in
das

01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
das
 
01:33:18.149 --> 01:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
hhs had in fact sent this over
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
in plenty of time
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
and it was um
 
01:33:23.669 --> 01:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:33:26.870 --> 01:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
basically uh an administrative error on
 
01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
the part of das as to why it is a late
 
01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:30.790 align:start position:0%
the part of das as to why it is a late
item

01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
item
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
it was not a late
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
what what we would
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
yeah it was not a late submittal it went
 
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
acted on it because of that so
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you so so madam chair is is that
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
is it your position that uh because it
 
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
was an administrative error there's no
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
public interest in having received due
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
notice of this voting item
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%

01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%

01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:15.910 align:start position:0%
okay now we have a question if we could
uh

01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh yes senator daniels thank you
 
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
being that these are 100 percent federal
 
01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:41.109 align:start position:0%
being that these are 100 percent federal
funds

01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
what are the restrictions
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
or the strings attached to taking this
 
01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
money and in particular on
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh information that has to be reported
 
01:35:53.669 --> 01:35:53.679 align:start position:0%
back to the federal government
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
so these funds are 100 arpa funds and if
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
i might also mention the purpose of this
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
is exactly the same purpose as the fema
 
01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
item that was approved earlier these
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
funds are for the contract for the at
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
home testing
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
these are arpa funds that are coming
 
01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
from gopher so i believe that um all of
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
the details on the federal requirements
 
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
have been provided by gopher previously
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
but these are the funds that
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
are more the generalized funds that
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
were granted to the state and go for
 
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
manages and distributes
 
01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:25.910 align:start position:0%
manages and distributes
yes

01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong but the 2.7
 
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
million that we previously approved was
 
01:36:35.109 --> 01:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
actually in an agency transfer it wasn't
 
01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
it wasn't
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
it didn't state that it was 100 federal
 
01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:40.159 align:start position:0%
funds it stated it was an agency
 
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
transfer yes so those are fema funds

a number of questions dealing with
 
01:40:55.590 --> 01:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
this particular request so who would
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative leitchman thanks madam
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
chair uh
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
first i'd like to thank you folks for
 
01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
the detailed explanation
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
that was provided i know in the past
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
we've been somewhat critical in not
 
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
getting all the information from
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
different agencies but this is a good
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
example of how it should be done
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that
 
01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
but going through it
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
i did have a question on page three
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
what is a sub-recipient
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
what is that i didn't see it in your
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
handle maybe i skipped it but what is
 
01:41:38.149 --> 01:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
that specifically sure
 
01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
so sub-recipient monitoring is when we
 
01:41:44.709 --> 01:41:44.719 align:start position:0%
provide funds to
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
to a contractor and they are acting on
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
our behalf
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
and the federal government requires us
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
to monitor
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
those contractors differently than
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
say a contractor that we ask to paint a
 
01:41:57.840 --> 01:41:58.709 align:start position:0%
say a contractor that we ask to paint a
wall

01:41:58.709 --> 01:41:58.719 align:start position:0%
wall
 
01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
so somebody that's delivering services
 
01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
that are statutorily required by our
 
01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
department or
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
are federally required by our department
 
01:42:10.229 --> 01:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
uh to provide um that those are
 
01:42:10.239 --> 01:42:11.830 align:start position:0%
uh to provide um that those are
sub-recipient

01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
sub-recipient
 
01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:12.830 align:start position:0%
sub-recipient
um

01:42:12.830 --> 01:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:15.990 --> 01:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
contractors thanks you're welcome that's
 
01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
all i have for the moment man i'm sure
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:20.070 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
questions

01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:20.080 align:start position:0%

01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
i i have a few representative edwards uh
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%

registry and i want to talk about it in
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
the context of
 
01:42:35.189 --> 01:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
what hhs oversight produced on november
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
1st relative to
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
a request of
 
01:42:38.639 --> 01:42:40.149 align:start position:0%
a request of
dhhs

01:42:40.149 --> 01:42:40.159 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
to um to do privacy impact assessments
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
on critical information systems
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
there's a tremendous amount of public
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
interest in what we're going to be doing
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:42:52.639 --> 01:42:53.990 align:start position:0%
with this
registry

01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
registry
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
and so i i'd like to ask
 
01:43:00.149 --> 01:43:00.159 align:start position:0%
if the department has undertaken
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
the development of a privacy impact
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
edwards so we have not currently begun
 
01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
that particular process to do a privacy
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
impact assessment on the immunization
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
information system which we also call
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
the registry i will note however that
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
the development of both the statute that
 
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
authorizes the immunization information
 
01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
system and its administrative rules have
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
been a long time in development over 10
 
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
years over a decade of work has gone
 
01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
into the development of both the statute
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
and the rules we're certainly happy to
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
um look at those other requirements as
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
recommended at you're here at your
 
01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
committee but we have not done that to
 
01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:48.390 align:start position:0%
committee but we have not done that to
date

01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
date
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh is the system set up so that it'll be
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
an uh an opt out or uh must it be an
 
01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:56.470 align:start position:0%
an uh an opt out or uh must it be an
opt-in

01:43:56.470 --> 01:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
opt-in
 
01:43:58.470 --> 01:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
it is currently and as as per the
 
01:44:01.750 --> 01:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
statute is currently an opt-out
 
01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:02.870 align:start position:0%
statute is currently an opt-out
system

01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
okay so for all those people who are
 
01:44:07.109 --> 01:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
deeply offended by an opt-out
 
01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
procedure it's just something we have to
 
01:44:12.149 --> 01:44:12.159 align:start position:0%
accept if we go ahead and fund this
 
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
currently that the way the system is
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
developed we we operate it fully within
 
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
the context of the law that it is is
 
01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
authorized in you know i will note that
 
01:44:26.070 --> 01:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
our opt-out system acts very much like
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
an opt-in in other states that have have
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
thought about opt-in because we do
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
require to be notified when you
 
01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
when information is going to be put into
 
01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
the registry the provider is supposed to
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
notify the patient and provide an
 
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them to opt out at that
 
01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:44.709 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them to opt out at that
moment

01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
moment
 
01:44:46.709 --> 01:44:46.719 align:start position:0%
can i make a request that if we approve
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
these funds that you'll um
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
work with mr weeders to
 
01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
to figure out
 
01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
how we could do a pro
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
sound privacy impact assessment on the
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry i i would i would
 
01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate your commitment to it
 
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
because i i do think it's a vital piece
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
of public transparency
 
01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
and chair veteran chair a point of order
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
yes in a recent letter from the attorney
 
01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
general we are not allowed to exact
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
conditions on the approval of
 
01:45:17.350 --> 01:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
disapproval of fiscal funds through this
 
01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:18.390 align:start position:0%
disapproval of fiscal funds through this
committee

01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
and so therefore while i respect what
 
01:45:21.669 --> 01:45:21.679 align:start position:0%
representative edwards is trying to do i
 
01:45:26.229 --> 01:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
so would you like them to refuse my
 
01:45:31.590 --> 01:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
pleasant request senator
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
i think you cannot conditionalize a vote
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
on a condition that we establish as a
 
01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
council okay okay
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
i did not i'm sorry i did not take that
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
as a conditional
 
01:45:42.719 --> 01:45:43.669 align:start position:0%
as a conditional
comment

01:45:43.669 --> 01:45:43.679 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:45:46.709 --> 01:45:46.719 align:start position:0%
i think from my perspective he was
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
simply asking dhhs if in fact they would
 
01:45:53.830 --> 01:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
do this privacy study
 
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
is that correct or incorrect yes it
 
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't a condition it was just saying if
 
01:46:01.590 --> 01:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
we passed this could would they be open
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
to committing
 
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
to doing a privacy impact assessment
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you if i may madam chair well
 
01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:08.470 align:start position:0%
thank you if i may madam chair well
noted

01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
noted
 
01:46:12.390 --> 01:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
if we pass this indicates conditional
 
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:15.270 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
so we will send the request from
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
division three
 
01:46:20.159 --> 01:46:21.350 align:start position:0%
division three
after

01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
after
 
01:46:23.590 --> 01:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
whatever happens with this vote
 
01:46:25.669 --> 01:46:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
and then just to make sure uh the public
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
understands uh how the money is going to
 
01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
be used to enhance the registry
 
01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.109 align:start position:0%
be used to enhance the registry
um

01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
i i understand there's a a couple of
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
main things that takes place with the
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
registry one
 
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
is it seems like it's a vital inventory
 
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
tracking system to make sure that
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
the vaccine supply that's in the state
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
we know where it's at we know how it's
 
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
being maintained we understand
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
expiration dates
 
01:46:55.199 --> 01:46:55.910 align:start position:0%
expiration dates
we

01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
we we can track
 
01:47:00.149 --> 01:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
shipment from point a to point b within
 
01:47:01.590 --> 01:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
the state we
 
01:47:04.149 --> 01:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
can determine our consumption rates and
 
01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
our waste rates
 
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
that that that that's a big part of what
 
01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
this registry does is it not that is
 
01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
correct it really is an accountability
 
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism on our part um we are
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
accountable for vaccine that we receive
 
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
directly from the federal government or
 
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
from other
 
01:47:21.189 --> 01:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
entities and then we hold in turn when
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
we provide vaccine to a provider's
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
office say a pediatrician's office we
 
01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
also hold them accountable for that
 
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine as well and this is the system
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
that does that efficiently if we didn't
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
have this i.t system and we've not since
 
01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:36.390 align:start position:0%
have this i.t system and we've not since
1998

01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
1998
 
01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:37.350 align:start position:0%
1998
what

01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
what would we be doing what what kind of
 
01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:40.470 align:start position:0%
what would we be doing what what kind of
waste

01:47:40.470 --> 01:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
waste
 
01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:42.159 align:start position:0%
would there be in the system if we were
 
01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
unable to to
 
01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
track it properly certainly so there's
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
certainly waste in terms of
 
01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:50.709 align:start position:0%
certainly waste in terms of
paper

01:47:50.709 --> 01:47:50.719 align:start position:0%
paper
 
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
is one of the big ways that we have been
 
01:47:54.149 --> 01:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
moving we've been
 
01:47:55.590 --> 01:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
running the program
 
01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
for a very long time for immunization is
 
01:47:59.669 --> 01:47:59.679 align:start position:0%
really paper records moving back and
 
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
forth and i think many of us would agree
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
that that is currently inefficient right
 
01:48:06.149 --> 01:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
now with most of our providers who have
 
01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
electronic health records or electronic
 
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
medical records ehrs emrs they're
 
01:48:13.189 --> 01:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
putting that information in their system
 
01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
it would be more efficient for them to
 
01:48:18.629 --> 01:48:18.639 align:start position:0%
then have a connectivity to our
 
01:48:21.350 --> 01:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
immunization information system that's
 
01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
something called an hl7 i'm not i don't
 
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
have the same technical expertise as you
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative edwards but i know enough
 
01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:29.679 align:start position:0%
that that allows one system to be able
 
01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
to talk to another system in the most
 
01:48:34.390 --> 01:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
secure and accurate way and that is
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
what much of this funds is going to
 
01:48:38.709 --> 01:48:38.719 align:start position:0%
right now or what we would hope to is to
 
01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
be able to help that connectivity so
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
that we can get information efficiently
 
01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
effectively and securely between
 
01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:46.390 align:start position:0%
effectively and securely between
entities

01:48:46.390 --> 01:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
i have more follow-ups i'm sorry i
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
should have been asking each time let's
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
um let's let's someone else and then
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
i'll come back to representative edwards
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
okay i have about just so you know i
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
have like three or four or more on the
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
tax registry that's fine
 
01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions uh
 
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
senator morris
 
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair i i've participated in three
 
01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
meetings this week and
 
01:49:12.070 --> 01:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
i thought we were going to start this
 
01:49:14.310 --> 01:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
meeting today with a presentation by the
 
01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:16.390 align:start position:0%
meeting today with a presentation by the
department

01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
one of those meetings after everyone
 
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
submitted questions was very helpful
 
01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
in understanding
 
01:49:25.430 --> 01:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
the two parts the 18 million dollars
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
number one on the contracts um so it may
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
answer a bunch of these questions if
 
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so thank you senator morris so
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
yep no no no problem
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
great i
 
01:49:45.430 --> 01:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
okay yes please go ahead great thank you
 
01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um so i think what i
 
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
could do is provide a very basic
 
01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
overview and i appreciate the question
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
senator remorse this funding really does
 
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
four major things it provides some staff
 
01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
to the department of health and human
 
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
services to manage the grant
 
01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
do a little bit of communications a
 
01:50:03.270 --> 01:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
little program management but more
 
01:50:05.910 --> 01:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
importantly it provides 10 individuals
 
01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
to help us with our data
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
and those individuals are going to be
 
01:50:10.950 --> 01:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
working directly with our pharmacies
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
with our healthcare providers as they
 
01:50:15.750 --> 01:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
onboard this connectivity to our
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
immunization information system the iis
 
01:50:20.790 --> 01:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
or the registry did you just say just
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
explain what you mean by on board sure
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
right thank you not everyone understands
 
01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
that term thank you thank you for the
 
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
for the question and the request for
 
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
clarification so onboarding is a process
 
01:50:34.950 --> 01:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
by which we ensure and test whether
 
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
system a at a pharmacy at a healthcare
 
01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:38.390 align:start position:0%
system a at a pharmacy at a healthcare
provider

01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
provider
 
01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
is sending the information it's supposed
 
01:50:43.109 --> 01:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
to send to our system and this is
 
01:50:45.589 --> 01:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
actually quite a long process sometimes
 
01:50:47.669 --> 01:50:47.679 align:start position:0%
it takes several months to get that done
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
because it's a process of testing back
 
01:50:51.589 --> 01:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
and forth we review the data we make
 
01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
sure the data is accurate on each side
 
01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
um most again as we know 50 49 other
 
01:50:59.510 --> 01:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
states in the country have some sort of
 
01:51:01.589 --> 01:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
registry and their experience is that
 
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
this typically takes several years to be
 
01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
able to onboard all of their providers
 
01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
in the community unfortunately in our
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
case when we were ready to go after our
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
statute was in place our rules were in
 
01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:13.910 align:start position:0%
statute was in place our rules were in
place

01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:15.679 align:start position:0%
we were hit with sort of a one-two punch
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
we were ready to go with our registry
 
01:51:19.990 --> 01:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
and we were hit with a covid19 pandemic
 
01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
at the same exact time so the urgency of
 
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
our work is greater than ever so that is
 
01:51:27.030 --> 01:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
what onboarding is it's the process of
 
01:51:29.669 --> 01:51:29.679 align:start position:0%
data testing where we work intensively
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
with folks on our in the department of
 
01:51:34.149 --> 01:51:34.159 align:start position:0%
health and human services with the it
 
01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
specialists in a number of providers
 
01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
offices we've provided this committee
 
01:51:40.709 --> 01:51:40.719 align:start position:0%
with a list of over 400 different health
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
care providers that we are anticipating
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
working with
 
01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
so that's what one of the components of
 
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
this funding will do is to provide us
 
01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
with that staff it's temporary staff we
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
anticipate needing them for up to about
 
01:51:56.470 --> 01:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
36 months most of them will
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully as we finish that onboarding
 
01:52:00.390 --> 01:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
process we will no longer have the need
 
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
for that same number of staff moving
 
01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:03.669 align:start position:0%
for that same number of staff moving
forward

01:52:03.669 --> 01:52:03.679 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
the second thing that this
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
funding does is it provides funding for
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
actually data system enhancements so
 
01:52:14.070 --> 01:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
again we talked a little bit about hl7
 
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
that onboarding process so it provides
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
some funding for that it also provides
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
funding for data enhancements for things
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
like managing temperature control you
 
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
know ensuring that we've really got a
 
01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
good bead and we can be accountable on
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
not wasting any of the vital vaccine
 
01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
that we have again this is not only
 
01:52:34.229 --> 01:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
covid19 vaccine we're also talking about
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
a vaccine for basic childhood
 
01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
immunizations polio measles mumps the
 
01:52:41.430 --> 01:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
sort of infectious diseases that most of
 
01:52:43.750 --> 01:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
us have never really encountered because
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
of the effectiveness of vaccine it will
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
also do data enhancements that will help
 
01:52:51.750 --> 01:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
providers or people out in the community
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
folks like school nurses school nurses
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
will have the opportunity to have a
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
special module that they can use because
 
01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
they are required to and mandated by law
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
to ensure immunization of the students
 
01:53:06.629 --> 01:53:06.639 align:start position:0%
in their schools or that at least we
 
01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
have record of that immunization this
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
will we one of the pieces we hope to
 
01:53:13.589 --> 01:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
fund would be a portal specifically for
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
school nurses so they they can see
 
01:53:17.350 --> 01:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
just their
 
01:53:19.589 --> 01:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
student population as mandated by the
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
statute and by rules
 
01:53:23.350 --> 01:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
the third thing that this funding does
 
01:53:26.310 --> 01:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
is it puts resources directly into the
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
hands of our health care providers there
 
01:53:31.350 --> 01:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
are resources available for hospitals
 
01:53:33.189 --> 01:53:33.199 align:start position:0%
there are resources available for
 
01:53:35.589 --> 01:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
unaffiliated health care practices we
 
01:53:37.270 --> 01:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
had had a question from the committee
 
01:53:38.709 --> 01:53:38.719 align:start position:0%
about what does the new hampshire
 
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
medical society have to do with this and
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
so we have
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
determined that we would like to work
 
01:53:45.669 --> 01:53:45.679 align:start position:0%
closely with the medical society so that
 
01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
they in turn could work with those
 
01:53:49.510 --> 01:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
unaffiliated practices those practices
 
01:53:51.750 --> 01:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
that are not part of big hospital
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
systems we're going to be working with
 
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
those big hospital systems and we're
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
going to also be working with other
 
01:53:59.030 --> 01:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
pharmacies and others to ensure that
 
01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
they have the resources they need to be
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
able to administer vaccine
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
do the i.t work on their end with their
 
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
ehrs and ensure the accountability of
 
01:54:12.070 --> 01:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
that vaccine again things like
 
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
refrigerators temps managing that within
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
their offices
 
01:54:18.229 --> 01:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
the fourth thing that this
 
01:54:20.070 --> 01:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
project does or these funds will do for
 
01:54:21.990 --> 01:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
us is a little bit of education and
 
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's education and ongoing
 
01:54:25.589 --> 01:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
communications over the course of the
 
01:54:27.589 --> 01:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
next three years some of that is
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer learning
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
between physicians and other physicians
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
so that they can share information more
 
01:54:36.550 --> 01:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
effectively as many people know we
 
01:54:38.790 --> 01:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
currently at the department do we
 
01:54:41.109 --> 01:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
twice monthly calls with our providers
 
01:54:43.350 --> 01:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
we think moving forward over the next
 
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
few years some of that work will be
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
better done from physician to physician
 
01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
through dartmouth or another entity so
 
01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
we would like to support that we also
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
have additional funds to doing other
 
01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
communications so that we can provide
 
01:54:57.750 --> 01:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
educational materials to our healthcare
 
01:54:59.910 --> 01:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
providers that are available in all the
 
01:55:01.830 --> 01:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
languages they need them to be and that
 
01:55:03.589 --> 01:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
address the questions that i know many
 
01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:05.199 align:start position:0%
people in the public have so i think
 
01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
that's a high overview of the four main
 
01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:15.830 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
so

01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:18.149 --> 01:55:18.159 align:start position:0%
were there any other questions other
 
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
than the follow-ups that representative
 
01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair i would at the end of the
 
01:55:27.589 --> 01:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
question period like to make a statement
 
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
okay fine
 
01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.030 align:start position:0%
okay fine
representative

01:55:33.030 --> 01:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:34.870 --> 01:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
can you point me to where in the
 
01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:41.109 align:start position:0%
can you point me to where in the
rsa141c20f

01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
that it says it must be an opt
 
01:55:46.149 --> 01:55:46.159 align:start position:0%
out system when i read this the registry
 
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
that law from 1998 it doesn't seem to
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
um i don't have the statute in front of
 
01:55:55.910 --> 01:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
me right now i have the rules in front
 
01:55:57.990 --> 01:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
of us where it does speak to that
 
01:56:00.149 --> 01:56:00.159 align:start position:0%
i understand the rules state that very
 
01:56:01.669 --> 01:56:01.679 align:start position:0%
clearly but the rules are not the
 
01:56:03.430 --> 01:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
legislation could you clarify where in
 
01:56:06.070 --> 01:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
the statute it says
 
01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
if i can pull up the statute in a minute
 
01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
i can help point you to that i just
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
don't have it in front of me
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:17.669 --> 01:56:17.679 align:start position:0%
take your time no problem i
 
01:56:19.510 --> 01:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that i have the statute in
 
01:56:20.870 --> 01:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
front of me as i look through my notes
 
01:56:23.350 --> 01:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
01:56:27.750 --> 01:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
if you have it on your computer i'd be
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
happy to look at it
 
01:56:33.430 --> 01:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
if that's okay with the chair that's
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh you can just come up
 
01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:46.950 align:start position:0%
uh you can just come up
oh

01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:48.550 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:56:48.550 --> 01:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
we're not going to let her go away with
 
01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
do you have other questions that we can
 
01:56:58.709 --> 01:56:58.719 align:start position:0%
answer while i'm looking this up
 
01:57:00.070 --> 01:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
oh i think it's right there on the
 
01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:01.030 align:start position:0%
oh i think it's right there on the
screen

01:57:01.030 --> 01:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
screen
 
01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
no any other question so i can take a
 
01:57:04.629 --> 01:57:04.639 align:start position:0%
minute to read that's why i was asking
 
01:57:04.639 --> 01:57:11.030 align:start position:0%
minute to read that's why i was asking
okay

01:57:11.030 --> 01:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:35.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:35.920 --> 01:58:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:04.149 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:07.030 --> 01:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 6c and that's what i was
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
just looking it is the procedures for
 
01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
the patient or the patient's parent or
 
01:58:12.470 --> 01:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
garden if the patient is a minor to
 
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
decline to participate in the registry
 
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
that is what we have interpreted as an
 
01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:25.109 align:start position:0%
that is what we have interpreted as an
opt-out

01:58:25.109 --> 01:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
fair enough i guess i'd like to and not
 
01:58:28.470 --> 01:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
now but i'd like to hear that from an
 
01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
attorney because it seems to me that the
 
01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:31.350 align:start position:0%
attorney because it seems to me that the
primary

01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
primary
 
01:58:32.709 --> 01:58:32.719 align:start position:0%
place it's okay
 
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
the primary place where your
 
01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:35.750 align:start position:0%
the primary place where your
uh

01:58:35.750 --> 01:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:36.950 --> 01:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
where that came in was in the rule
 
01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:37.910 align:start position:0%
where that came in was in the rule
making

01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
making
 
01:58:39.189 --> 01:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
and i totally agree that that's in the
 
01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
rule-making but if it really is just in
 
01:58:43.270 --> 01:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
the rule-making then it would possibly
 
01:58:44.629 --> 01:58:44.639 align:start position:0%
be possible for you to change that
 
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
without any legislation
 
01:58:48.470 --> 01:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay we'll um
 
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
i would need i we would need an attorney
 
01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:52.719 align:start position:0%
and council to tell us that
 
01:58:52.719 --> 01:58:53.990 align:start position:0%
and council to tell us that
okay

01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
all right um anything else from anyone
 
01:59:00.149 --> 01:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
so jess you had i'm sorry
 
01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
representative edwards you had some
 
01:59:04.629 --> 01:59:04.639 align:start position:0%
additional questions i i do thank thank
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
you so much
 
01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:59:10.470 --> 01:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
okay so as representative irv kind of
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
kicked off the the next area i wanted to
 
01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
get into about the vax registry
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
and that is um
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:59:23.109 --> 01:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
this is the the portion of the registry
 
01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
that has the public the most interested
 
01:59:31.109 --> 01:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
and to some extent upset is they believe
 
01:59:31.119 --> 01:59:33.109 align:start position:0%
and to some extent upset is they believe
that

01:59:33.109 --> 01:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:37.030 --> 01:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
there was a requirement for us to
 
01:59:40.229 --> 01:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
collect some personal data and to travel
 
01:59:42.550 --> 01:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
transfer that personal data to the
 
01:59:45.669 --> 01:59:45.679 align:start position:0%
federal government and there's a this
 
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
lingering perception
 
01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:49.270 align:start position:0%
lingering perception
that

01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
we opted to over collect
 
01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
personal data
 
01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
well beyond what the federal
 
01:59:59.589 --> 01:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
government's requirements were and so
 
02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
the belief is that new hampshire
 
02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:03.669 align:start position:0%
the belief is that new hampshire
is

02:00:03.669 --> 02:00:03.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:00:03.679 --> 02:00:05.589 align:start position:0%
is
surrendering

02:00:05.589 --> 02:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
surrendering
 
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
patient privacy that we really had no
 
02:00:10.229 --> 02:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
requirement to do so
 
02:00:12.070 --> 02:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering if you could speak
 
02:00:13.109 --> 02:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
to that
 
02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
of whether or not we are strictly
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
limiting the collection and transfer to
 
02:00:22.629 --> 02:00:22.639 align:start position:0%
the minimum essential data set required
 
02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
by federal statute
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
or alternatively
 
02:00:28.070 --> 02:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
have we decided
 
02:00:30.390 --> 02:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
individually to enhance that data
 
02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:31.830 align:start position:0%
individually to enhance that data
collection

02:00:31.830 --> 02:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
collection
 
02:00:34.070 --> 02:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question so um in
 
02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
terms of what we send to the cdc
 
02:00:40.070 --> 02:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
specifically around covet 19 we actually
 
02:00:42.390 --> 02:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
sent aggregate data they have asked us
 
02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
for individual line level data we as the
 
02:00:46.870 --> 02:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
02:00:49.510 --> 02:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
have sent them aggregate data so in fact
 
02:00:51.750 --> 02:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
less information than the federal
 
02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
government required
 
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
so so could thank you for that could you
 
02:00:58.709 --> 02:00:58.719 align:start position:0%
speak to the other part of it though
 
02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
which is um are are we in our database
 
02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh intending to collect more data
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
that's then what's required by the
 
02:01:10.149 --> 02:01:10.159 align:start position:0%
federal mandate
 
02:01:12.790 --> 02:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
are we for our own purposes are we over
 
02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:13.910 align:start position:0%
are we for our own purposes are we over
collecting

02:01:13.910 --> 02:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
collecting
 
02:01:15.750 --> 02:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
are you asking in terms of are we over
 
02:01:17.669 --> 02:01:17.679 align:start position:0%
collecting for the information that we
 
02:01:19.350 --> 02:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
need here within the department of
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
health and human services not that we're
 
02:01:22.629 --> 02:01:22.639 align:start position:0%
sending out is that i'm trying to
 
02:01:24.709 --> 02:01:24.719 align:start position:0%
clarify basically
 
02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
you're saying what we need i i always
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
say what we want but it's a semantic
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
great um i would have to i'm not
 
02:01:35.189 --> 02:01:35.199 align:start position:0%
prepared right now to do a line by line
 
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
of all of the data elements um i'm happy
 
02:01:39.669 --> 02:01:39.679 align:start position:0%
to do that if we had had that question
 
02:01:41.109 --> 02:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
earlier i could have been well prepared
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
for that sure i've been sick sorry
 
02:01:44.159 --> 02:01:45.270 align:start position:0%
for that sure i've been sick sorry
um

02:01:45.270 --> 02:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
one more set okay
 
02:01:49.750 --> 02:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
this is about the um
 
02:01:52.709 --> 02:01:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:55.030 --> 02:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
as you know i
 
02:01:57.510 --> 02:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's been my point of view
 
02:02:00.229 --> 02:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
that we have a severe workforce shortage
 
02:02:01.669 --> 02:02:01.679 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:02:04.229 --> 02:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
and already today we've approved four or
 
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
five additional slots for the department
 
02:02:11.430 --> 02:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
and here's a big chunk of um of 13 more

and it just brings up questions to me of
 
02:02:16.950 --> 02:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh where are we going to get these
 
02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:18.950 align:start position:0%

02:02:45.030 --> 02:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
table the uh 13 positions that are
 
02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
in this
 
02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
sure so
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
um a couple options available to the
 
02:02:51.669 --> 02:02:51.679 align:start position:0%
committee for motions if it was the
 
02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
intent of the member to
 
02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
pass the funding but not the positions
 
02:02:58.709 --> 02:02:58.719 align:start position:0%
they would move to adopt uh 353 item one
 
02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
only and to deny
 
02:03:03.830 --> 02:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
item two which establishes the positions
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
okay so i would like to move
 
02:03:10.390 --> 02:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
that the committee adopt item one on 353
 
02:03:12.070 --> 02:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
and not item two
 
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
and i can speak to that motion okay i
 
02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:21.990 --> 02:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
oh okay uh
 
02:03:28.070 --> 02:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
senator morris seconds
 
02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
you may speak to your motion
 
02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh madam chair that this is uh
 
02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
this is representative of a
 
02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
long-standing issue um with
 
02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
our workforce crisis here in new
 
02:03:43.109 --> 02:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire i i
 
02:03:45.510 --> 02:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
i just see that we keep
 
02:03:47.910 --> 02:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
adding more and more and more
 
02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:49.030 align:start position:0%
adding more and more and more
bodies

02:03:49.030 --> 02:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh on paper
 
02:03:53.189 --> 02:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
where i just don't know where we're
 
02:03:54.709 --> 02:03:54.719 align:start position:0%
going to get them from and even if we
 
02:03:57.270 --> 02:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
can get them i think we're doing damage
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
to the private sector by pulling human
 
02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
resources into the government
 
02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:03.270 align:start position:0%
resources into the government
so

02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:05.910 --> 02:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
02:04:09.189 --> 02:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
commit to bringing in yet another 13
 
02:04:12.069 --> 02:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
people i would just assume
 
02:04:12.079 --> 02:04:12.870 align:start position:0%
people i would just assume
let

02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
let
 
02:04:14.790 --> 02:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
the money that would be allocated for
 
02:04:17.109 --> 02:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
those people be used for the other
 
02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%
programmatics i'm not saying we should
 
02:04:21.910 --> 02:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
cut the money but i am saying that
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
there's uh i'm i'm i'm not enthusiastic
 
02:04:26.229 --> 02:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
at all about
 
02:04:26.239 --> 02:04:28.870 align:start position:0%
at all about
um

02:04:28.870 --> 02:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
adding 13 more people at this point
 
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any
 
02:04:37.270 --> 02:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
are there any other any other discussion
 
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
on this
 
02:04:40.950 --> 02:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative senator morris
 
02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:46.709 --> 02:04:46.719 align:start position:0%
in fairness to the representative he
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
brought this up to me earlier today
 
02:04:53.990 --> 02:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
and i do have concerns about vacancies
 
02:04:55.830 --> 02:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
in all our departments not just this
 
02:04:58.470 --> 02:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
department um and and i said that to the
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
representative and i said i think that's
 
02:05:02.069 --> 02:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
something that the legislature is going
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
to have to address in january
 
02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:05.189 align:start position:0%
to have to address in january
um

02:05:05.189 --> 02:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:05.199 --> 02:05:06.470 align:start position:0%
um
because

02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:05:09.510 --> 02:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
if we have a 15 vacancy running in
 
02:05:11.350 --> 02:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:12.229 align:start position:0%
health and human services
um

02:05:12.229 --> 02:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money
 
02:05:16.390 --> 02:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
um and you know we could have wrote the
 
02:05:18.950 --> 02:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
check for this quite honestly but i
 
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
think that's something the legislature
 
02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
definitely has to come back
 
02:05:25.669 --> 02:05:25.679 align:start position:0%
and look at as we get into january
 
02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
along with the fact that i've asked for
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
a look at the cafe to see how much money
 
02:05:32.229 --> 02:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
is left over from last year that i want
 
02:05:33.589 --> 02:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
to talk about
 
02:05:35.109 --> 02:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
you're headed down the same pike that i
 
02:05:38.229 --> 02:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
think the senate would go down
 
02:05:42.550 --> 02:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:44.629 --> 02:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i accomplished anything by
 
02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
supporting you on not putting these 13
 
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
positions in when we're talking about 3
 
02:05:52.390 --> 02:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
000 positions jess that's the only thing
 
02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:53.109 align:start position:0%
000 positions jess that's the only thing
so

02:05:53.109 --> 02:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:53.119 --> 02:05:54.790 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:05:54.790 --> 02:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
i guess at this point i'm not prepared
 
02:05:59.109 --> 02:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
to go with that motion
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
i i appreciate that i just am a believer
 
02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
that uh when you're in a hole you just
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:09.990 --> 02:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments
 
02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
on this particular motion
 
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
okay can i ask for an explanation
 
02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
for mr kane so does this mean that we
 
02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:19.030 align:start position:0%
for mr kane so does this mean that we
are

02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:06:20.629 --> 02:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
if this passes
 
02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
we'd be accepting part one
 
02:06:25.350 --> 02:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
and not part two now it may be a final
 
02:06:26.950 --> 02:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
vote on the whole package that is
 
02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:27.830 align:start position:0%
vote on the whole package that is
correct

02:06:27.830 --> 02:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:29.199 align:start position:0%

02:06:51.910 --> 02:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
senator gaida did you want to
 
02:06:54.950 --> 02:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
say whatever you wanted to say now
 
02:06:56.310 --> 02:06:56.320 align:start position:0%

02:06:58.229 --> 02:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
chairman okay thank you and i thank the
 
02:07:00.550 --> 02:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
committee for its indulgence
 
02:07:02.470 --> 02:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
president ronald reagan once said that
 
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
freedom is never more than one
 
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
generation from extinction
 
02:07:07.589 --> 02:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
we didn't pass it to our children in the
 
02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
bloodstream it must be fought for
 
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
protected and handed out
 
02:07:14.069 --> 02:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
for them to do the same or one day we'll
 
02:07:15.830 --> 02:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
spend our sunset years telling our
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
children and our children's children
 
02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
what it was once like in the united
 
02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:19.430 align:start position:0%
what it was once like in the united
states

02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
where men were free
 
02:07:23.350 --> 02:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
this fiscal committee item has
 
02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
precipitated an incredible amount of
 
02:07:28.149 --> 02:07:28.159 align:start position:0%
public sentiment in opposition
 
02:07:30.069 --> 02:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
and it may well be a defining vote for
 
02:07:31.669 --> 02:07:31.679 align:start position:0%
those in elected office those on this
 
02:07:31.679 --> 02:07:32.709 align:start position:0%
those in elected office those on this
committee

02:07:32.709 --> 02:07:32.719 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:07:34.229 --> 02:07:34.239 align:start position:0%
and is therefore deserving of our most
 
02:07:36.069 --> 02:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
careful scrutiny
 
02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
the department is doing what it believes
 
02:07:39.990 --> 02:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
it must do
 
02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
its mission and i quote is to join
 
02:07:43.750 --> 02:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
communities and families in providing
 
02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities for citizens to achieve
 
02:07:47.750 --> 02:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
health and independence end quote
 
02:07:50.550 --> 02:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
and its intentions are understandable
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
but we are not the department
 
02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
we are the elected representatives
 
02:07:56.310 --> 02:07:56.320 align:start position:0%

freedom
 
02:08:00.470 --> 02:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
and the freedom of their children
 
02:08:02.470 --> 02:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
and to future generations
 
02:08:04.629 --> 02:08:04.639 align:start position:0%

government is capable of producing

our founding president george washington

government is like fire

that we as legislators often forget

to look at the efficacy of programs

distinguished legal scholar i'm sure

that the terms of the contract under

today
 
02:09:47.109 --> 02:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
to weigh the potential benefit

of increased government efficiency

that is under review for its

constitutionality
 
02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
and the constitutional rights

of that order as they affect the
 
02:10:03.830 --> 02:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
citizens of our state i have served my
 
02:10:06.069 --> 02:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
country as an officer of marines in
 
02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
places you cannot
 
02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:09.510 align:start position:0%
places you cannot
mention

02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
mention
 
02:10:11.430 --> 02:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
places you cannot pronounce
 
02:10:13.030 --> 02:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
okay and done things in the interests of
 
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
our country i've served as an fbi agent
 
02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
i have seen the abuses that government
 
02:10:21.589 --> 02:10:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:23.109 --> 02:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
i had the privilege of
 
02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
captaining incredible engines of
 
02:10:27.669 --> 02:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
commerce around the world i have been in
 
02:10:29.589 --> 02:10:29.599 align:start position:0%
china i've been in hong kong i've been
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
in pakistan i've been in venezuela i've
 
02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
been in all the places
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
where government has gradually and
 
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately completely encroached and
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
destroyed the liberty of its citizens
 
02:10:43.109 --> 02:10:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:45.030 --> 02:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
i've been in china where the government
 
02:10:47.030 --> 02:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
monitors and assesses the worthiness of
 
02:10:49.510 --> 02:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
citizens to partake in the benefits it
 
02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
doles out to them
 
02:10:52.950 --> 02:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
where it decides whether or not citizens
 
02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
are deserving of employment
 
02:10:56.470 --> 02:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
whether it decides how many children a
 
02:10:58.149 --> 02:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
family may bring into the world where it
 
02:10:59.910 --> 02:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
controls every aspect of the lives of
 
02:11:01.750 --> 02:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
the people over which it rules
 
02:11:03.270 --> 02:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
we'd like to believe our government our
 
02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
federal government specifically wouldn't
 
02:11:06.950 --> 02:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
do such things
 
02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
our federal government would never
 
02:11:10.149 --> 02:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
weaponize the irs to audit those who
 
02:11:12.149 --> 02:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
differ in their political views
 
02:11:13.669 --> 02:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
but it did
 
02:11:15.189 --> 02:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
our federal government would never order
 
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
a sniper to murder vicki weaver an
 
02:11:20.069 --> 02:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
unarmed woman with a child in her arms
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
based on warrants that would replete
 
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
with misinformation but it did
 
02:11:26.149 --> 02:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
our federal government would never
 
02:11:28.149 --> 02:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
ambush and kill a non-violent man
 
02:11:29.830 --> 02:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
driving to meet a sheriff in the mahler
 
02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
national forest
 
02:11:33.189 --> 02:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
but it did
 
02:11:34.709 --> 02:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
and our federal government would never
 
02:11:36.550 --> 02:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
threaten to weaponize the fbi against
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
parents who want their children educated
 
02:11:40.229 --> 02:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
and not indoctrinated
 
02:11:42.310 --> 02:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
but it did
 
02:11:44.229 --> 02:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
our federal government would never force
 
02:11:45.990 --> 02:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
a person to take an experimental
 
02:11:48.149 --> 02:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
injection against their will as a
 
02:11:49.990 --> 02:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
condition of employment or continued
 
02:11:53.990 --> 02:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
service in the military but it did
 
02:11:55.990 --> 02:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
the contract before us states that data
 
02:11:57.750 --> 02:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
collected by the state is de-identified
 
02:11:59.430 --> 02:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
and aggregated before being sent to the
 
02:12:01.350 --> 02:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
but we have to ask ourselves in the
 
02:12:04.709 --> 02:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
first instance
 
02:12:06.069 --> 02:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
why is the state government even
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
collecting this data individually
 
02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
identifiable to begin with
 
02:12:12.390 --> 02:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
and why are the private entities giving
 
02:12:15.270 --> 02:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
automatically sending detailed personal
 
02:12:22.149 --> 02:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
data to the federal government
 
02:12:23.430 --> 02:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
under the terms of the grant under
 
02:12:25.030 --> 02:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
consideration the department states the
 
02:12:27.510 --> 02:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
data is de-identified and aggravated
 
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
02:12:30.790 --> 02:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
but under the terms of this very same
 
02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:31.830 align:start position:0%
but under the terms of this very same
agreement

02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
02:12:33.589 --> 02:12:33.599 align:start position:0%
the protection remains only until the
 
02:12:35.830 --> 02:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
cdc or another federal entity requires
 
02:12:37.750 --> 02:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
the disclosure of that identifiable data
 
02:12:39.750 --> 02:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
at some point in the future and for some
 
02:12:42.149 --> 02:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
purpose unknown to us and utterly beyond
 
02:12:43.669 --> 02:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
our control
 
02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
i have no problem with what we're trying
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
to do i have a problem with the federal
 
02:12:49.510 --> 02:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
government and the contract that's that
 
02:12:51.669 --> 02:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
will be signed as a part of this grant
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
gives them unquestionably the authority
 
02:12:55.350 --> 02:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
to change the rules without our word out
 
02:12:56.550 --> 02:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
of us
 
02:12:57.910 --> 02:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
the action we take today will be
 
02:12:57.920 --> 02:12:59.109 align:start position:0%
the action we take today will be
historic

02:12:59.109 --> 02:12:59.119 align:start position:0%
historic
 
02:13:00.629 --> 02:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
it will be historic because we will
 
02:13:02.550 --> 02:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
either reject the notion of subservience
 
02:13:04.870 --> 02:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
to government coercion
 
02:13:06.709 --> 02:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
or will be historic because we exceed to
 
02:13:07.990 --> 02:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
that notion and violate the most
 
02:13:09.589 --> 02:13:09.599 align:start position:0%
fundamental premises of freedom upon
 
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
which our state and nation were founded
 
02:13:13.589 --> 02:13:13.599 align:start position:0%
and which are imperiled as never before
 
02:13:16.149 --> 02:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
us in our nation's history
 
02:13:17.430 --> 02:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
i think you have a sense of where i'm
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
going to vote on this
 
02:13:21.189 --> 02:13:21.199 align:start position:0%

there will be no outburst from the
 
02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:35.350 align:start position:0%
there will be no outburst from the
audience

02:13:35.350 --> 02:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
audience
 
02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:37.270 align:start position:0%
audience

okay
 
02:13:39.589 --> 02:13:39.599 align:start position:0%
so if you would
 
02:13:43.030 --> 02:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:45.030 --> 02:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
quieting down
 
02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:46.950 align:start position:0%
quieting down
okay

02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:13:48.390 --> 02:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
are there
 
02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:13:56.069 --> 02:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
of the five to 600 email that i have
 
02:13:59.589 --> 02:13:59.599 align:start position:0%
received on this item 84 percent
 
02:14:02.470 --> 02:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
were against it and they were against it
 
02:14:05.189 --> 02:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
for primarily two reasons
 
02:14:07.350 --> 02:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
one of them was the sharing of data the
 
02:14:10.229 --> 02:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
collection of data not knowing where
 
02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to go and through just the
 
02:14:14.550 --> 02:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
discussions we've heard today
 
02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:15.350 align:start position:0%
discussions we've heard today
no

02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:14:16.790 --> 02:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
the it would be
 
02:14:19.669 --> 02:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
known by the contractor the state the
 
02:14:22.790 --> 02:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
cdc and even private organization like
 
02:14:24.870 --> 02:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
the medical society
 
02:14:27.109 --> 02:14:27.119 align:start position:0%
the problem is
 
02:14:30.069 --> 02:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
that when government at any level starts
 
02:14:32.229 --> 02:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
collecting our data
 
02:14:34.149 --> 02:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
we tend to lose our individual
 
02:14:34.159 --> 02:14:35.510 align:start position:0%
we tend to lose our individual
sovereignty

02:14:35.510 --> 02:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
sovereignty
 
02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:36.629 align:start position:0%
sovereignty
and

02:14:36.629 --> 02:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:14:39.589 --> 02:14:39.599 align:start position:0%
therefore we begin to disrupt distrust
 
02:14:41.270 --> 02:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
the government that's supposed to be
 
02:14:43.750 --> 02:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
working for us
 
02:14:46.149 --> 02:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
to to carry on
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
we also are asked
 
02:14:50.790 --> 02:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
to sign this contract
 
02:14:54.229 --> 02:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
it's a blank piece of paper
 
02:14:56.069 --> 02:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
that that says
 
02:14:57.990 --> 02:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
that you are agreeing to
 
02:14:58.000 --> 02:14:58.950 align:start position:0%
that you are agreeing to
whatever

02:14:58.950 --> 02:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:14:58.960 --> 02:14:59.990 align:start position:0%
whatever
we

02:14:59.990 --> 02:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:15:02.550 --> 02:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
we the federal government are dictating
 
02:15:04.629 --> 02:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
now and in the future
 
02:15:06.950 --> 02:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
we don't know what that's going to be
 
02:15:09.109 --> 02:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
that's exactly the reason we turned this
 
02:15:11.510 --> 02:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
down two months ago there is nothing in
 
02:15:14.709 --> 02:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
this proposal that has changed from two
 
02:15:16.950 --> 02:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
months ago except that you're adding one
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
more position as a program manager
 
02:15:22.390 --> 02:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's anyone in here
 
02:15:24.790 --> 02:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
that would responsibly sign a piece of
 
02:15:28.550 --> 02:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
paper for a job or anything else
 
02:15:30.069 --> 02:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
not knowing
 
02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
what is going to be written on there
 
02:15:34.229 --> 02:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
that you're going to be held committed
 
02:15:34.239 --> 02:15:35.430 align:start position:0%
that you're going to be held committed
to

02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:15:37.669 --> 02:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
for that reason i will be voting against
 
02:15:40.069 --> 02:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
this i don't see any reason
 
02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
that we i should change my vote from
 
02:15:44.390 --> 02:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
what it was two months ago
 
02:15:46.229 --> 02:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
when we tabled it
 
02:15:48.069 --> 02:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
i was hoping to get
 
02:15:49.830 --> 02:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
more information
 
02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:51.669 align:start position:0%
more information
particularly

02:15:51.669 --> 02:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
02:15:54.629 --> 02:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
i believe a comment was raised before
 
02:15:57.350 --> 02:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
we'll take the language out
 
02:15:57.360 --> 02:15:58.629 align:start position:0%
we'll take the language out
and

02:15:58.629 --> 02:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:00.870 --> 02:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
the answer was we can't do that because
 
02:16:03.430 --> 02:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
it's federal language
 
02:16:05.589 --> 02:16:05.599 align:start position:0%
we have a letter from the attorney
 
02:16:09.189 --> 02:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
general saying that well the language in
 
02:16:11.510 --> 02:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
there doesn't mean what it means
 
02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
we treated every piece of legislation in
 
02:16:16.709 --> 02:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
the same way then what are we doing
 
02:16:19.589 --> 02:16:19.599 align:start position:0%
by passing legislation and somebody
 
02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
interpreting it that we don't really
 
02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:22.629 align:start position:0%
interpreting it that we don't really
mean

02:16:22.629 --> 02:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:16:24.069 --> 02:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
what we're saying
 
02:16:26.550 --> 02:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
so if we're going to get back to basics
 
02:16:27.669 --> 02:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
and start
 
02:16:29.990 --> 02:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
putting things and and if it's in black
 
02:16:31.270 --> 02:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
and white
 
02:16:33.429 --> 02:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
understanding that that's what it means
 
02:16:34.950 --> 02:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
and that's what's going to hold up in
 
02:16:37.110 --> 02:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
the court of law then we ought to be
 
02:16:42.870 --> 02:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:44.950 --> 02:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
please i don't want to have to ask you
 
02:16:47.429 --> 02:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
to leave
 
02:16:47.439 --> 02:16:48.709 align:start position:0%
to leave

02:25:55.830 --> 02:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
which is um

on the use of state tab 12
 
02:26:01.830 --> 02:26:01.840 align:start position:0%

02:26:07.670 --> 02:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
are there any questions yes
 
02:26:10.469 --> 02:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
would it be appropriate to move uh tab
 
02:26:13.590 --> 02:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
12 13 and 14
 
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
at once
 
02:26:18.630 --> 02:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
because they are such diverse items i
 
02:26:20.550 --> 02:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
thought it would be better to handle
 
02:26:24.309 --> 02:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
them separately in case someone has okay
 
02:26:28.309 --> 02:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:32.309 --> 02:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on 12

02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:41.990 --> 02:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:43.030 align:start position:0%
and that is
um

02:33:43.030 --> 02:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:48.630 --> 02:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
it's your your dhhs on the um
 
02:33:50.150 --> 02:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
on your
 
02:33:52.469 --> 02:33:52.479 align:start position:0%
ch chart i don't know what
 
02:33:55.910 --> 02:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
what the chart number is but it shows
 
02:33:59.510 --> 02:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
number of positions filled
 
02:34:01.110 --> 02:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:34:03.910 --> 02:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:03.920 --> 02:34:05.150 align:start position:0%
 
below

02:34:05.150 --> 02:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
below
 
02:34:08.550 --> 02:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
2700 on on that
 
02:34:08.560 --> 02:34:10.230 align:start position:0%
2700 on on that
and

02:34:10.230 --> 02:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:13.429 --> 02:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
it looks like we took a pretty steep
 
02:34:13.439 --> 02:34:14.870 align:start position:0%
it looks like we took a pretty steep
drop

02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
drop
 
02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:16.070 align:start position:0%
drop
in

02:34:16.070 --> 02:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:34:18.870 --> 02:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the fiscal year
 
02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:20.550 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the fiscal year
and

02:34:20.550 --> 02:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:23.830 --> 02:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
my concern is
 
02:34:26.070 --> 02:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
i think as
 
02:34:29.750 --> 02:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative edwards identified
 
02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:30.710 align:start position:0%
representative edwards identified
as

02:34:30.710 --> 02:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:34:34.230 --> 02:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
many people sitting here are concerned
 
02:34:34.240 --> 02:34:37.190 align:start position:0%
many people sitting here are concerned
that

02:34:37.190 --> 02:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:39.590 --> 02:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
we're we're not
 
02:34:41.830 --> 02:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
we're just not able to hire i guess is
 
02:34:44.070 --> 02:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
the right term unless something has
 
02:34:44.080 --> 02:34:45.110 align:start position:0%
the right term unless something has
happened

02:34:45.110 --> 02:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
happened
 
02:34:46.469 --> 02:34:46.479 align:start position:0%
over the last
 
02:34:49.110 --> 02:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
three or so months that
 
02:34:52.309 --> 02:34:52.319 align:start position:0%
obviously this chart ends in july
 
02:34:54.950 --> 02:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
so if if you could just address what's
 
02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
going on
 
02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
with our hiring sure so i guess i would
 
02:35:01.590 --> 02:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
ask lori weaver to come up to talk a
 
02:35:04.309 --> 02:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
little bit about hiring um but just a
 
02:35:06.790 --> 02:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
clarification on the chart uh the
 
02:35:09.270 --> 02:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
straight line is back from
 
02:35:12.389 --> 02:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
2018 this chart had not been updated for
 
02:35:14.870 --> 02:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
years and years and years and
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
part of
 
02:35:18.230 --> 02:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
the hb1
 
02:35:20.389 --> 02:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
legislation that
 
02:35:22.550 --> 02:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
reduced the number of funded positions
 
02:35:25.270 --> 02:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
in the department required reporting on
 
02:35:27.270 --> 02:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
keeping positions under 3 000 filled
 
02:35:29.670 --> 02:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
positions so i uh brought this chart
 
02:35:31.670 --> 02:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
back to life and started putting those
 
02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
numbers on there so that's why you see
 
02:35:35.990 --> 02:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
that weird drop it it's artificial okay
 
02:35:38.230 --> 02:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
um the other thing i would just say uh
 
02:35:39.910 --> 02:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
why while you've given me the
 
02:35:41.910 --> 02:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to senator morris's point
 
02:35:45.030 --> 02:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
earlier about position labs i don't
 
02:35:47.429 --> 02:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
think that dhhs will have a lot of
 
02:35:49.349 --> 02:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
position laps although we do have a lot
 
02:35:52.309 --> 02:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
of vacant positions because of that
 
02:35:55.270 --> 02:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
footnote in hb1 that reduced the budget
 
02:35:58.070 --> 02:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
by 22 million or so
 
02:36:00.630 --> 02:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
um or over the biennium it was 22
 
02:36:01.990 --> 02:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
million i believe
 
02:36:04.550 --> 02:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
um in position laps so i i think that
 
02:36:06.150 --> 02:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
that is going to be
 
02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
a majority of our position laps there
 
02:36:10.630 --> 02:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
will be some and um i think hopefully
 
02:36:12.630 --> 02:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
the note is still on the cover page i
 
02:36:13.750 --> 02:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
won't be able to provide lapse
 
02:36:15.750 --> 02:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
information until january it's it's not
 
02:36:17.270 --> 02:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
accurate until we have at least six
 
02:36:20.070 --> 02:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
months of data um so i should have
 
02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:21.190 align:start position:0%
months of data um so i should have
something

02:36:21.190 --> 02:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:36:23.110 --> 02:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
if not for the january meeting i could
 
02:36:25.030 --> 02:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
report out on it at the january meeting
 
02:36:26.230 --> 02:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
it'll be on the dashboard for the
 
02:36:31.030 --> 02:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:33.750 --> 02:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair mayor ask your question
 
02:36:37.349 --> 02:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
on this issue yes okay um thank you very
 
02:36:37.359 --> 02:36:38.469 align:start position:0%
on this issue yes okay um thank you very
much

02:36:38.469 --> 02:36:38.479 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:36:41.830 --> 02:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
could you could you tell me if
 
02:36:43.429 --> 02:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
the department has a condition of
 
02:36:46.550 --> 02:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
employment as requiring the vaccine
 
02:36:48.870 --> 02:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
and are there any positions for which it
 
02:36:53.030 --> 02:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:55.750 --> 02:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
we are not requiring vaccine to be
 
02:36:58.150 --> 02:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
employed by the department there is a
 
02:37:00.550 --> 02:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
question mark on some of our uh health
 
02:37:03.349 --> 02:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
care facilities on whether the cms
 
02:37:05.429 --> 02:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
mandate is going to
 
02:37:07.110 --> 02:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
impact them mainly new hampshire
 
02:37:09.990 --> 02:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
hospital and glencliff home so
 
02:37:11.590 --> 02:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
as you know and the attorney general
 
02:37:13.429 --> 02:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
could speak more to this than than
 
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
myself but we have signed on to the
 
02:37:17.670 --> 02:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
lawsuit contesting the mandate both the
 
02:37:20.950 --> 02:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
cms and the in the um business mandate
 
02:37:23.110 --> 02:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
um so we're waiting to to get more
 
02:37:25.750 --> 02:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
information from that lawsuit i i i want
 
02:37:28.150 --> 02:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
to thank you for everything you're doing
 
02:37:29.990 --> 02:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
and can still do in the future to
 
02:37:35.590 --> 02:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:38.150 --> 02:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay please go ahead hello my name is
 
02:37:40.389 --> 02:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
lori weaver i'm the deputy commissioner
 
02:37:42.469 --> 02:37:42.479 align:start position:0%
of the department you were asking about
 
02:37:44.710 --> 02:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
retention and workforce well i'm asking
 
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
about hiring hiring yeah i mean i
 
02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
realize retention goes with it sure
 
02:37:52.389 --> 02:37:52.399 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately i think we are in the
 
02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
same boat as many other state
 
02:37:56.309 --> 02:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
departments and agencies that we face
 
02:37:58.389 --> 02:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
hiring challenges over the last year
 
02:38:00.550 --> 02:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
we've had an average of a 20 percent
 
02:38:02.950 --> 02:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
aggregate so that would be across the
 
02:38:05.750 --> 02:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
department in all divisions uh 20
 
02:38:08.309 --> 02:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates so as soon as we fill
 
02:38:10.230 --> 02:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
positions they may vacate on the other
 
02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
end we have about 50 percent of our
 
02:38:15.349 --> 02:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
population in the department of staff is
 
02:38:15.359 --> 02:38:16.469 align:start position:0%
population in the department of staff is
about

02:38:16.469 --> 02:38:16.479 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:38:18.790 --> 02:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
direct care positions so those are folks
 
02:38:20.550 --> 02:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
that are out in the field servicing our
 
02:38:23.510 --> 02:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
citizens meeting with families children
 
02:38:25.510 --> 02:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
adults what have you those have been
 
02:38:27.110 --> 02:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
particularly hard to fill during the
 
02:38:29.349 --> 02:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
time of a pandemic a lot of folks don't
 
02:38:31.670 --> 02:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
want to put themselves at risk
 
02:38:34.469 --> 02:38:34.479 align:start position:0%
going out into communities and into
 
02:38:35.990 --> 02:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
homes so
 
02:38:38.070 --> 02:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
we have we even have vacancies in our
 
02:38:40.389 --> 02:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
human resources department so even that
 
02:38:41.910 --> 02:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
has been a challenge we've gotten
 
02:38:44.230 --> 02:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
creative we've spent some money with
 
02:38:45.750 --> 02:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
different kinds of recruitment different
 
02:38:47.429 --> 02:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
kinds of advertising working with
 
02:38:49.830 --> 02:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
schools and colleges we just did the
 
02:38:52.070 --> 02:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
manchester community college fair a
 
02:38:53.990 --> 02:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
couple of months ago recruiting looking
 
02:38:55.670 --> 02:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
at high school students coming out of
 
02:38:56.870 --> 02:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
high school and working in the
 
02:38:56.880 --> 02:38:58.070 align:start position:0%
high school and working in the
department

02:38:58.070 --> 02:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:38:59.910 --> 02:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
trying to look under every rock possibly
 
02:39:01.670 --> 02:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
that we can to find people
 
02:39:03.349 --> 02:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
the thing that keeps people at the
 
02:39:04.389 --> 02:39:04.399 align:start position:0%
department is that we're a
 
02:39:06.389 --> 02:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
mission-driven organization so people
 
02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
come to the department because they want
 
02:39:09.429 --> 02:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
to serve and they want to
 
02:39:11.110 --> 02:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
help the citizens of the state and we've
 
02:39:12.550 --> 02:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
been trying to market that as much as
 
02:39:14.950 --> 02:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
possible to define those folks too but a
 
02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
lot of other people are looking for them
 
02:39:18.790 --> 02:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
as well so we have not given up on our
 
02:39:18.800 --> 02:39:19.910 align:start position:0%
as well so we have not given up on our
efforts

02:39:19.910 --> 02:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
02:39:22.710 --> 02:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately as soon as one fills
 
02:39:25.349 --> 02:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
another one vacates right okay and if i
 
02:39:27.590 --> 02:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
could just add that 20 includes unfunded
 
02:39:30.469 --> 02:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
positions thank you karen oh okay
 
02:39:32.309 --> 02:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
all right are there any other questions
 
02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
for hhs
 
02:39:37.030 --> 02:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:40.630 --> 02:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:42.150 --> 02:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
02:39:44.070 --> 02:39:44.080 align:start position:0%

02:39:46.630 --> 02:39:46.640 align:start position:0%

02:39:54.240 --> 02:39:56.230 align:start position:0%
i've been alongside you in many of those
meetings

02:39:56.230 --> 02:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
02:39:58.230 --> 02:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
02:40:00.070 --> 02:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
get the information that we believe we
 
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
needed this week
 
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to vote on an item today
 
02:40:06.710 --> 02:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you for all that you've done to
 
02:40:09.910 --> 02:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
get us the answers to questions um
 
02:40:11.990 --> 02:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
beyond that i'd also like to say i know
 
02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
the house
 
02:40:14.950 --> 02:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
faced the same challenge that the senate
 
02:40:17.990 --> 02:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
faced i i know with senator geiter i was
 
02:40:19.910 --> 02:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
on the phone with him wednesday night
 
02:40:22.630 --> 02:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
telling him that if he wanted his vote
 
02:40:25.510 --> 02:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
represented um you need to get back on a
 
02:40:27.429 --> 02:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
plane and
 
02:40:29.590 --> 02:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
he told me he'd let me know that and he
 
02:40:33.349 --> 02:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
did and he came back here today
 
02:40:34.870 --> 02:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
and i know in the house they had the
 
02:40:36.230 --> 02:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
same issue
 
02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:37.030 align:start position:0%
same issue
um

02:40:37.030 --> 02:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:39.030 --> 02:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
i've i've been very
 
02:40:39.040 --> 02:40:41.349 align:start position:0%
i've i've been very
very

02:40:41.349 --> 02:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:40:43.590 --> 02:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
upfront about the fact of what i believe
 
02:40:45.750 --> 02:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
in in the fiscal committee i mean you
 
02:40:47.590 --> 02:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
all get a hundred dollars and i get an
 
02:40:49.349 --> 02:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
extra 25
 
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
and we come to this committee and we
 
02:40:53.349 --> 02:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
actually read this book
 
02:40:53.359 --> 02:40:54.550 align:start position:0%
actually read this book
and

02:40:54.550 --> 02:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:40:56.870 --> 02:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
the reality of it is i think it's made
 
02:40:59.590 --> 02:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
hhs better i think the presentations
 
02:41:00.950 --> 02:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
this week have
 
02:41:03.349 --> 02:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
gone beyond where they normally would be
 
02:41:05.429 --> 02:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
and i think it made it so that we can
 
02:41:06.950 --> 02:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
make decisions
 
02:41:09.990 --> 02:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
but i'd also like to be very clear
 
02:41:12.309 --> 02:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
i took the same oath to the constitution
 
02:41:13.670 --> 02:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
02:41:15.750 --> 02:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
into the
 
02:41:17.590 --> 02:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
and while i sit here
 
02:41:19.590 --> 02:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
there is no doubt that when i make
 
02:41:21.910 --> 02:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
decisions i make them the same way you
 
02:41:23.030 --> 02:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
do bob
 
02:41:25.349 --> 02:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
i make them believed on the fact that
 
02:41:27.030 --> 02:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
i'm doing the right thing
 
02:41:28.710 --> 02:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
because of my position in the new
 
02:41:31.269 --> 02:41:31.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire senate and i know you respect
 
02:41:31.279 --> 02:41:32.070 align:start position:0%
hampshire senate and i know you respect
that

02:41:32.070 --> 02:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:41:34.630 --> 02:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
and i just want to make that clear
 
02:41:37.269 --> 02:41:37.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
02:41:39.590 --> 02:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh senator d'alessandro thank you madam
 
02:41:39.600 --> 02:41:40.469 align:start position:0%
uh senator d'alessandro thank you madam
chair

02:41:40.469 --> 02:41:40.479 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:41:42.309 --> 02:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
madam chief i'd like to do two things
 
02:41:44.389 --> 02:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
first of all i would like to reinforce
 
02:41:46.870 --> 02:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
what the senate president said
 
02:41:48.469 --> 02:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
kudos on the way you've handled the
 
02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
meeting and the way uh your people have
 
02:41:52.630 --> 02:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
gone through the week in preparation for
 
02:41:55.510 --> 02:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
this meeting i i'm i'm truly impressed
 
02:41:57.750 --> 02:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
by the way you handled the crew
 
02:41:57.760 --> 02:41:58.389 align:start position:0%
by the way you handled the crew
so

02:41:58.389 --> 02:41:58.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:42:00.309 --> 02:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
you get a bonus for that you're not
 
02:42:02.309 --> 02:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
going to get another 25 bucks because
 
02:42:04.389 --> 02:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
but if we take up a collection here we
 
02:42:06.389 --> 02:42:06.399 align:start position:0%
might be able to come up with that
 
02:42:09.349 --> 02:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
um i take an oath i've been here a long
 
02:42:09.359 --> 02:42:10.150 align:start position:0%
um i take an oath i've been here a long
time

02:42:10.150 --> 02:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:42:11.910 --> 02:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
and we all do the best that we can and
 
02:42:14.150 --> 02:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
we respect everybody else's opinion and
 
02:42:15.990 --> 02:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
i think that's that's extremely
 
02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:17.110 align:start position:0%
i think that's that's extremely
important

02:42:17.110 --> 02:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:42:19.269 --> 02:42:19.279 align:start position:0%
i think communication is the key we've
 
02:42:21.990 --> 02:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
had better communication i spoke about
 
02:42:23.990 --> 02:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
communication a couple of meetings ago
 
02:42:26.870 --> 02:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
and i think it's improved we can do a
 
02:42:28.870 --> 02:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
much better job if we get good
 
02:42:30.790 --> 02:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
communication and that means good
 
02:42:33.429 --> 02:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
information in a timely fashion
 
02:42:37.030 --> 02:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
that makes us better legislators and i i
 
02:42:40.389 --> 02:42:40.399 align:start position:0%
think that's worth coming and
 
02:42:42.710 --> 02:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's been part and parcel of the process
 
02:42:44.630 --> 02:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
and the last thing i i sent you a
 
02:42:47.030 --> 02:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
notification saying i was going to say
 
02:42:48.469 --> 02:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
this i talked to
 
02:42:51.510 --> 02:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
senator daniels about this also i think
 
02:42:55.030 --> 02:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
when we ask a department head to be here
 
02:42:58.550 --> 02:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
that department head should be here
 
02:43:00.469 --> 02:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
uh we need that
 
02:43:02.790 --> 02:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
senator daniels explained to me why a
 
02:43:04.630 --> 02:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
particular person wasn't i appreciate
 
02:43:07.190 --> 02:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
that very much the work that you did
 
02:43:08.950 --> 02:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
but indeed
 
02:43:11.510 --> 02:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
the department heads serve the
 
02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:13.910 align:start position:0%
the department heads serve the
legislature

02:43:13.910 --> 02:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
02:43:16.790 --> 02:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
when a department head is asked to be
 
02:43:20.150 --> 02:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
here that department head should be here
 
02:43:22.950 --> 02:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
people have questions there are times
 
02:43:25.269 --> 02:43:25.279 align:start position:0%
the only person that can accurately
 
02:43:27.750 --> 02:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
answer those questions is the department
 
02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:28.710 align:start position:0%
answer those questions is the department
head

02:43:28.710 --> 02:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
head
 
02:43:31.590 --> 02:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
so i i want to make that point emphatic
 
02:43:33.670 --> 02:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yes
 
02:43:36.309 --> 02:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh i think that
 
02:43:38.790 --> 02:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
i jumped ahead of myself but
 
02:43:41.030 --> 02:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
i think that based on your comment
 
02:43:44.070 --> 02:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
senator that i will delay
 
02:43:47.510 --> 02:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
the um education
 
02:43:49.429 --> 02:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
comments from today
 
02:43:52.230 --> 02:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
and reschedule them for
 
02:43:55.670 --> 02:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
our next meeting which i believe is
 
02:43:59.030 --> 02:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
