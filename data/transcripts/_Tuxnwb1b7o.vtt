house rules
 
00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
committee and uh the first order of
 
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
business is uh requests for late
 
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 align:start position:0%

Maguire thank you Mr Speaker members of
 
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
Dan Maguire I represent the town of
 
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 align:start position:0%
Epsom I'm here to ask you um to let me
 
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
late draft a a bill on SAU
 
00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
consolidation it's actually a bill that
 
00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 align:start position:0%
I did put in during the drafting period
 
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 align:start position:0%
um but a few days later I got a note
 
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
from um OS saying we cannot draft this
 
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 align:start position:0%
because you haven't given us enough
 
00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
information now I think I did I told
 
00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
them you know
 
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
what the saus would look like a after
 
00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
consolidation the process of
 
00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
consolidating them the timeline and so
 
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
on um there's going to be new elective
 
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 align:start position:0%
offices involved in all those kind of
 
00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 align:start position:0%
details but they claimed well you know
 
00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 align:start position:0%
saus are mentioned 50 times in the rsas
 
00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 align:start position:0%
and you didn't tell us for all of those
 
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
you know what are you going to do right
 
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
and so I I I argued with them for a
 
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
little bit and um I ended up saying okay
 
00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
I'll just write it myself so in the
 
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
ensuing whatever 10 days or so I um I
 
00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 align:start position:0%
put in the work and went through all of
 
00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 align:start position:0%
those it's actually more like 80
 
00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 align:start position:0%
references to sa use in the rsas but I
 
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
went through them all I have a draft
 
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's ready to go and um
 
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
it it's almost line for line of what
 
00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
they're going to need to to put into the
 
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 align:start position:0%
RSA into the bill so I think that they
 
00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
can do it without any further
 
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
information from this and
 
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
um so also there is some urgency right
 
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
you so you might just say well put it in
 
00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 align:start position:0%
next year right but the way the timing
 
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
works on this transition period is a
 
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 align:start position:0%
one-year delay with this bill would be
 
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
more like a two-year delay because um
 
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
there's a certain election calendar
 
00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 align:start position:0%
thing so so the bill makes new
 
00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 align:start position:0%
superintendents elected and you they
 
00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
they have to be uh start the election
 
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 align:start position:0%
process at a certain time and so on so
 
00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 align:start position:0%
there's there's a there's a timeline
 
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
involved in the bill and so doing this a
 
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
year from now there wouldn't be enough
 
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
time for that process to work right and
 
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
so it would end up being like a two-year
 
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
delay so I'm asking you for permission
 
00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
to late draft this
 
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for presenting this so just to
 
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 align:start position:0%
be clear though when OS said they
 
00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
couldn't do it did they also just give
 
00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 align:start position:0%
you a specific list of the things for
 
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
you to provide not exactly they it was
 
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
more like a list of complaints it there
 
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
was no question marks on it right they
 
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
didn't say what about this what about
 
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
that they just sort of said well you
 
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
didn't say this you didn't say that you
 
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
didn't you know it it and I and when I
 
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
talked to them it was
 
00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 align:start position:0%
like it it just they weren't very
 
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
cooperative me it's it's that simple and
 
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
I just thought you know I'm not going to
 
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
say it wasn't a useful process for me to
 
00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
write the bill um uh it took me a long
 
00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.870 align:start position:0%
write the bill um uh it took me a long
time

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
but I did actually get into all the
 
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
little places that that this uh this
 
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
touches I mean most of them I most of
 
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
them have no change because there's seus
 
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
now there will be seus later so you know
 
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 align:start position:0%
there there's no change but but some
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
sober thank you Mr Speaker and thank you
 
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm I'm wondering
 
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
about the timelines when was it that
 
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
they told you that they couldn't
 
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
draft and did you have an adequate
 
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
amount of time I mean you have done yeah
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
the answer is work and and could it have
 
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
been done but by the deadline is the
 
00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 align:start position:0%
question I think not because um it was I
 
00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
put this in a few days before the
 
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
deadline I heard back from them after a
 
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
day or two so there was maybe a day or
 
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
two left and and the 20 hours I put in I
 
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
didn't do it you know 20 hours straight
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
I did two hours a day for 10 days or
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
something like that you know so uh
 
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:03.639 align:start position:0%
m sweny m speak I would move to accept
 
00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:06.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
drafting motion to accept
 
00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:14.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 align:start position:0%
Weber although the process
 
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
is concerning and the issues with os are
 
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.909 align:start position:0%
is concerning and the issues with os are
concerning

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 align:start position:0%
concerning
 
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
um one of the things we have always held
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
to is um a certain factor of exigency
 
00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:41.919 align:start position:0%
and I am Al although I am sensitive to
 
00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:43.879 align:start position:0%
the concerns
 
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
about uh how long it takes for
 
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
implementation I don't think that that
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
rises to the level of
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
um needing late drafting this time
 
00:07:59.189 --> 00:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
around as opposed to putting it in any
 
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
year here um I'm willing to be convinced
 
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise but I haven't heard anything
 
00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:09.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:24.639 align:start position:0%

okay if there's no disc well
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
Weber I will only say that because of
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
the extremely long period of time for
 
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
the house to do The house's work which I
 
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
I think is very useful in some cases uh
 
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to be up to the speaker and
 
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
the committee chairs to make sure that
 
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
people don't get lulled into a false
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
sense of having more time and and
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
getting the work out and figuring out
 
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
what are time schedule is going to be
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
coming up to the deadline and getting
 
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
work out before the deadline but um
 
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
having said that I have no objection to
 
00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
the way it's the way it's written it's
 
00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:43.880 align:start position:0%

house rule 28 proposed by representative
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
Liv and Steven
 
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker members of the
 
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
committee um as you all know I'm sure
 
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
last year there was an issue uh arose as
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
subpoenas uh issued by the legislature
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
when um as as I understand it a
 
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
committee chair uh determined that it
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
was appropriate to uh
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
without much discussion that to issue a
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
subpoena um as a result of that um I
 
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
think a number of people including
 
00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:06.519 align:start position:0%
representative Smith and myself uh
 
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
concluded that we should have a change
 
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
to the rule uh dealing with
 
00:12:18.189 --> 00:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
subpoenas um uh to make sure that before
 
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
that happened and before there were any
 
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
was any action taken in the event that a
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
subpoena was not complied with that um
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
there would be more centralized and uh
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh knowing basis for doing that
 
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
including making sure that the uh that
 
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
uh um leadership was uh aware of what
 
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
was going on and and uh were on board
 
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
with doing it so the the first part uh
 
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
the changes that are proposed in the
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
rule are the one are what is in bold um
 
00:12:54.189 --> 00:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
the language in rule 20 in the rule 28
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
itself proper before you get to
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
subdivision a the Bold in bolded
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
language there uh was was drafted by
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative Smith uh representative
 
00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
Smith and I think it um it
 
00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:07.590 align:start position:0%
Smith and I think it um it
accomplishes

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
accomplishes
 
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
um the goal that I just spoke of in in
 
00:13:13.629 --> 00:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
ensuring that uh there will be approval
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh from the rules committee um before um
 
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
a subpoena is issued um and then
 
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.750 align:start position:0%
a subpoena is issued um and then
um

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
uh the subsection a which is sort of the
 
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement me mechanism if a subpoena
 
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
is not complied with I drafted that um
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
basically to make certain that um before
 
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
there was any effort to hold someone in
 
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
contempt for failing to comply with the
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
subpoena um that um the matter had been
 
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
uh presented um to the floor for a vote
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
of uh of the majority of the house uh
 
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
and only then and only with the
 
00:13:56.189 --> 00:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
speaker's approval thereafter uh would
 
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate action be taken um to uh
 
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
enforce to take action to enforce the
 
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
subena I should say just by way of
 
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
background that there is another stat uh
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
legislative change that is being
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
proposed as a statute uh that which the
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
speaker is the prime sponsor that
 
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
establishes both a criminal penalty and
 
00:14:23.949 --> 00:14:23.959 align:start position:0%
a civil remedy for some someone who
 
00:14:27.629 --> 00:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
without just cause fails to uh comply
 
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
with the subpoena issued by by uh either
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
the house or the senate or a joint uh if
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
there was a joint legislative committee
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
um and it basically it it um establishes
 
00:14:43.749 --> 00:14:43.759 align:start position:0%
those um those penalties provides a
 
00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:45.959 align:start position:0%
mechanism uh for in the case of a
 
00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:47.759 align:start position:0%
criminal it's a it it creates a
 
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor offense and it requires that
 
00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
uh any prosecution for uh contempt of
 
00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature be brought only by the
 
00:14:59.470 --> 00:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and brought
 
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
only in the marrat County Superior Court
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
in the case of the Civil remedy it
 
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
allows either house to uh go to court to
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
uh seek civil contempt remedies or uh to
 
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
ask the Attorney General again to seek
 
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
civil contempt remedies and that again
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.310 align:start position:0%
 
Court

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
Court
 
00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:29.079 align:start position:0%
pres thank you uh representative Lynn so
 
00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
the legislation has been introduced but
 
00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
um in the absence of that legislation
 
00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:40.519 align:start position:0%
remedy well you interestingly I think
 
00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:43.759 align:start position:0%
the if historically I think it's it's
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
generally recognized both at the federal
 
00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:48.519 align:start position:0%
level and in the state that that the
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
legislature has the authority inherent
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
authority to issue subpoenas and to
 
00:15:57.629 --> 00:15:57.639 align:start position:0%
compel compliance with subpoenas um in
 
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
fact if you you I in doing some research
 
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
on this apparently the it doesn't it it
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
happens almost never now but the um as
 
00:16:12.749 --> 00:16:12.759 align:start position:0%
recently as like 1914 if I'm if I'm
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
remembering correctly the US the US
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
Congress actually sent the uh um the you
 
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
know the the Congressional Marshall at
 
00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
the time out to arrest somebody who had
 
00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
failed to comply with a subpoena and
 
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
that that is a proper uh uh way for the
 
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
legislature to to
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
operate I am not suggesting for a moment
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
that I think that's something that you
 
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
know we should begin employing on any
 
00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
kind of a routine basis um but I think
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
it I think it is important to understand
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
that we legislators do have that
 
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
inherent Authority I think the purpose
 
00:16:53.069 --> 00:16:53.079 align:start position:0%
of the statute is to is basically to say
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
look if if and when we ever get to those
 
00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
rare situations where it it is felt the
 
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
how the house does feel or the Senate
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
does feel that it's necessary to hold
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
somebody in contempt these are the
 
00:17:05.789 --> 00:17:05.799 align:start position:0%
procedures that would be that would
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
generally be followed would which would
 
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
involved further questions Senator
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
Weber I was just going to
 
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
ask I I understand your reasoning for
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
that but because that statute has not
 
00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
yet been enacted is not the provision of
 
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
subdivision a not a little
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
premature um I no I don't I mean I I
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
guess I don't think so because if we
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
didn't if we didn't um if we if the
 
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:41.240 align:start position:0%
statute is passed um I think you would
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
want language in the rules that were
 
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
consistent and and I guess the other
 
00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
thing that I would say is I mean even if
 
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
the statute were not passed I think
 
00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:53.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you want to
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
have something spelled out more in more
 
00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
detail than it is now now as to what
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
happens if somebody doesn't comply with
 
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
a subpoena I mean this this is worded in
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
a it's worded pretty generically it says
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
this uh the speaker shall take
 
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate action to sanction such
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
conduct and enforce compliance with the
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
subpoena if the statute is passed the
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
statute sets out sort of the way that
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
that would happen um if the statute is
 
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
not passed I guess this you know that it
 
00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
will be in the speaker's hands to
 
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
determine um what action would be
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate I suppose the speaker could
 
00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
say if it was egregious enough could say
 
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to you know I'm going to ask
 
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
the house to authorize me to have the
 
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
Sergeant at Arms U go out and arrest the
 
00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
person who failed to comply I again I
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
think that would
 
00:18:46.029 --> 00:18:46.039 align:start position:0%
be an extraordinary circumstance um that
 
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
would would not happen uh you know in a
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
in a in except in that kind of a
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
circumstance but I suppose this you know
 
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
this legislature does have that
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional Authority mat I have a
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
quick followup I I certainly agree that
 
00:19:04.029 --> 00:19:04.039 align:start position:0%
having a um procedure available rather
 
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
than leaving it completely up in the air
 
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
is not a bad thing I I do however note
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
that I'm hearing Mrs Casey my sixth
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
grade teacher's voice in my ear saying
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
subdivide into an a unless there's a b
 
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
and perhaps that would be better written
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
as a second as another paragraph Without
 
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.750 align:start position:0%
as a second as another paragraph Without
a

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
subheading and I just note that that
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
because Mrs Casey is not letting me get
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
away with it otherwise but thank you I I
 
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
take no I mean if that if you know I
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
take no position on that you may be
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
right and that maybe it would be better
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
to just have it as a second paragraph
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
without an a I I leave that to the
 
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
committee's discretion but I I I I Don't
 
00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.230 align:start position:0%
committee's discretion but I I I I Don't
Really

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
Really
 
00:19:54.149 --> 00:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
Care thank you
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
Simpson yeah thank you um so I think
 
00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
what I heard you say earlier is that if
 
00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
this did Issue or situation did arise
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
that we could figure out the procedures
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
at that time of how we would enforce
 
00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
this or how the speaker would enforce
 
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
this and I I'm concerned that um doing
 
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0%
that in the heat of any moment might not
 
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
be the best time to do it and that I
 
00:20:24.029 --> 00:20:24.039 align:start position:0%
would want more of it to be fleshed out
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
in this paragraph um so the first thing
 
00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
would be so
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
who then would be the marshals as the
 
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
marshals for the US Congress do you mean
 
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
like the sergeant of arms would be the
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
equivalent to the marshals I would I
 
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
would I would think so and I I guess
 
00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
what I would say representative Simpson
 
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
is I think I think if you look at this
 
00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.029 align:start position:0%
is I think I think if you look at this
and

00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:47.039 --> 00:20:49.190 align:start position:0%
and
compare

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
compare
 
00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:53.799 align:start position:0%
um uh the the language I think it does
 
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
with what is there now I mean I think it
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
does set it does place a number of
 
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
additional restrictions over what the
 
00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
what the rule says now in other words it
 
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
it requires the approval of the rules
 
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
committee um uh to before the subpoena
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
so a chair a chairman of a committee
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be able to decide hey you
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
know this is I want to I'm going to
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
subpoena witness X that has to uh that
 
00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:21.799 align:start position:0%
has to go to the rules committee the
 
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
rules committee has to approve it the
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
rules committee um can set um uh
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
conditions on on how a subpoena should
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
be issued that kind of thing and then
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
the provision for enforcement which
 
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
right now there is no real provision for
 
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement so I suppose you know right
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
now um the speaker would
 
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
have um I would think more discretion
 
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
under existing procedure than under this
 
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
because this this sort of circumscribes
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
the speaker discretion which I think is
 
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
is the whole U the whole idea was to
 
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
make this you know to make to make sure
 
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
that this really this that in these
 
00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:05.559 align:start position:0%
extraordinary circumstances where we
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
decided to do something like this it
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
was it was with you know everybody was
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
sort of on board and it was with the
 
00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:16.039 align:start position:0%
with the approval of a majority of all
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
of the members of the
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
House other question yeah thank you um
 
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you that helps um I am still
 
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
wanting a little bit higher of a bar
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
would you you be open to instead of it
 
00:22:32.909 --> 00:22:32.919 align:start position:0%
requiring a majority vote of the entire
 
00:22:36.669 --> 00:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
house um maybe a 3 fifths vote of the
 
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
house you know I would have I guess I
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
would have a pro personally I would have
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
a problem with that because I I think
 
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand that the
 
00:22:52.269 --> 00:22:52.279 align:start position:0%
house th this inherent Authority as you
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
know has I think if you looked at the
 
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
you know the case law around the country
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
this inherent Authority has existed in
 
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies I think going I mean
 
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
going back to England it's it's not this
 
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
isn't something that's kind of new it's
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
very true that for you know thankfully
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
we have never uh you know had a practice
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire of kind of employing
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
this on a on a willy-nilly basis or
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
really as far as I can recall at all um
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
but it's a it's an authority that does
 
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
exist and I guess I
 
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
would it seems to me that if a majority
 
00:23:31.149 --> 00:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
maity of the of the members of of the
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
house felt that somebody was in contempt
 
00:23:35.909 --> 00:23:35.919 align:start position:0%
and that some action should be taken I
 
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
would think think that that would be
 
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
enough to move the process forward uh
 
00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
um holding the person in you know
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
sending the person for example let's
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
even assume it's civil cont typically
 
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
what would happen in civil contempt is
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
the person would be said okay you didn't
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
comply you didn't have any just reason
 
00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
for not complying you must comply and
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
you know the most extreme sanction would
 
00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
be for the court for the for somebody to
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
say you're going to jail until you
 
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
comply but that would have to be a court
 
00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
the the legislature can't put somebody
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
in jail so it would have to be a court
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
that would do that it seems to me that
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
it's enough protection if a majority of
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature felt that the matter
 
00:24:26.909 --> 00:24:26.919 align:start position:0%
should be referred to court and then the
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
court is the only one that could
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
actually you know sort of pull the pull
 
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
the lever so to speak and as a final
 
00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
thing to say yes you are you are going
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
to jail until you comply um so I I I
 
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
guess I that's a long way of saying I
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
enough further discussion further
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
questions Z
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
Smith thanks for your presentation is
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
isn't the real nugget that we get out of
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
the other par though the house already
 
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
has subpoena power right and what's
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
never addressed is the house subpoenas
 
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
me and I go
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
now we feel like I'm in contempt of the
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
house but it isn't explicitly stated and
 
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
that's what this accomplishes it sure no
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
exactly I mean I think that's the whole
 
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
and that's the thing that's the again
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the statute is to you
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
know to flesh out all the things that
 
00:25:27.389 --> 00:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
that that happened so I think it's very
 
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
I think it's important
 
00:25:33.789 --> 00:25:33.799 align:start position:0%
further question so along those lines
 
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559 align:start position:0%
then isn't it better to have the rule
 
00:25:38.389 --> 00:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
before the statute so that there's
 
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
something for the statute to refer to
 
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
refer to yeah no I think this I think
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
that makes sense
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely further
 
00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
discussion chair isable yes thank you um
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to support the notion of
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
having a three-fifth vote versus a
 
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
majority vote um I guess I mean who's to
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
say about anything but it seems to me
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
that at some level if it's just the
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
majority it could be used as a political
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
tool in some way and if you had
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
three-fifths of the house you would feel
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
more secure that it was uh a consensus
 
00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:21.799 align:start position:0%
of a very large number of the house
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
members because being in contempt is
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
being held in contempt is a rather
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
extraordinary measure me so I would
 
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
personally feel more comfortable if it
 
00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.669 align:start position:0%
personally feel more comfortable if it
was

00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.679 --> 00:26:40.830 align:start position:0%

move on to amendment to house rule

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
naer good morning Mr Speaker and
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
committee my um amendment to house rule
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
two is very straightforward it's just um
 
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
all members in the house chamber shall
 
00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:47.919 align:start position:0%
be dressed in proper business
 
00:27:50.909 --> 00:27:50.919 align:start position:0%
attire the House of Representatives is a
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
hallowed institution with a 200e history
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
dignity and respect should Prevail and
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
our dress the way we dress should
 
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
reflect that we've seen a lot of casual
 
00:28:05.509 --> 00:28:05.519 align:start position:0%
clothing which cheapens the decorum
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
we've seen not enough clothing I've seen
 
00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:10.519 align:start position:0%
ripped jeans in
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
committee I remember in 2008 when I was
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
first learning about uh New Hampshire
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
politics speaker Donna scitec taught a
 
00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
class and she said she always wore a
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
jacket it doesn't mean you have to go
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
into Hawk to dress properly for the
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
house I had a friend that served her
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
first two terms with me she went to
 
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
Goodwill bought two jackets and she
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
switched them out for those two years
 
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
and then her second term she had a new
 
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
jacket so she had three to switch and
 
00:28:39.549 --> 00:28:39.559 align:start position:0%
that was fine so I hope that you'll
 
00:28:42.029 --> 00:28:42.039 align:start position:0%
agree with me and pass the
 
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
for Smith a
 
00:28:54.029 --> 00:28:54.039 align:start position:0%
motion I move to accept the amendment to
 
00:28:58.909 --> 00:28:58.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
representative Osborne oh representative
 
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
Weber oh you second second oh sorry okay
 
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
I thought there was a second oh
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative Oz one second is there
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
any further
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
discussion yes that's that's what I was
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
raising my hand for um as you will
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
remember Mr Speaker we addressed this
 
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
extensively in 2016 yes I do remember
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
and the issue is
 
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
uh proper business attire I am well
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
aware of the fact that I came from a
 
00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
physical therapy appointment today and I
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
am wearing the equivalent of a
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
t-shirt um I noticed that there are
 
00:29:42.669 --> 00:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
other members here who are not wearing
 
00:29:45.549 --> 00:29:45.559 align:start position:0%
constructive jackets with lapels I don't
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
own one with lapel anymore thank god um
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking and I actually agree
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
very much in principle with this because
 
00:29:59.070 --> 00:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
as I tell my fourth graders we are
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
representing our town when we come to
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
the legislature and we want to represent
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
our town and be respectful but I am
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
thinking of the innumerable
 
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
layers of what I think of as proper
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
business attire and what other people
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
may think of as proper business attire
 
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
and the people who may run a foul of it
 
00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
either because of uh medical conditions
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
that requires special shoes or less
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
shoes than any of us would rather people
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
had on or um other things like that I'm
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
also thinking
 
00:30:42.029 --> 00:30:42.039 align:start position:0%
of um the number of people for example
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
who wear athletic shoes as opposed to
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
what I think of as business shoes and
 
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
finally with respect to the point about
 
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
going to Goodwill for the
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
jackets um every one of us makes a
 
00:30:59.669 --> 00:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
financial sacrifice to serve this place
 
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
and for some of us that sacrifice is a
 
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
great deal more than for others but the
 
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
whole having to figure out whether it's
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
Goodwill whether it's something
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
else it's demeaning to have to make
 
00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:20.559 align:start position:0%
those kinds of considerations and I'm
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
concerned about that for those members
 
00:31:26.629 --> 00:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
who are making a really difficult
 
00:31:29.629 --> 00:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
sacrifice in in order to serve in this
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
place so for those reasons I think if if
 
00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
you would want to prescrib no blue jeans
 
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
or no ripped clothing although I
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
remember a member who as a matter of
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
religious observants wore a sweatshirt
 
00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
that had its sleeves snipped out
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
um I think without knowing exactly what
 
00:31:59.149 --> 00:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
proper business attire is you Mr Speaker
 
00:32:02.669 --> 00:32:02.679 align:start position:0%
are going to have a tough time of it so
 
00:32:05.629 --> 00:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
uh for that reason I'm although I
 
00:32:07.629 --> 00:32:07.639 align:start position:0%
support it in principle I personally
 
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.669 --> 00:32:14.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.679 --> 00:32:16.230 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
I Simpson up
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
first um so my concern is how uh this
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
will be fleshed
 
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
out uh I'm concerned of who is is going
 
00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
to make the specific decisions about
 
00:32:34.029 --> 00:32:34.039 align:start position:0%
what business attire is so I'm thinking
 
00:32:36.669 --> 00:32:36.679 align:start position:0%
of the um like school dress codes where
 
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
there has to be you know how long can
 
00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:41.720 align:start position:0%
the skirt be how um must you wear a
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
skirt um do the does what the women wear
 
00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
have to be a certain way and the men
 
00:32:50.629 --> 00:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
wear a certain way um and so I'm
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about who's going to make uh
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
make those decisions and then who's
 
00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
going to enforce them um
 
00:33:02.909 --> 00:33:02.919 align:start position:0%
um which is not spelled out here so I'll
 
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
be voting against this as well thank
 
00:33:09.629 --> 00:33:09.639 align:start position:0%
you Smith I have more faith than that I
 
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
think the idea is we do not want a
 
00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
representative showing up for committee
 
00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
or a house session wearing flipflops
 
00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
board short and a and a wo hang forever
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
shirt that hasn't been washed since Co I
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
mean I think things where this rule
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
would arise are going to be pretty
 
00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.990 align:start position:0%
would arise are going to be pretty
obvious

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
obvious
 
00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
I don't believe the intent is that um I
 
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
have to start shopping at Lord and
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
Taylor or Brooks Brothers I got this on
 
00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
clearance for 50 bucks and I'm very
 
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
happy with
 
00:33:42.269 --> 00:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
it I further believe that when there is
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
an issue it'll be glaringly obvious and
 
00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
that the leaders of both caucuses in the
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
house will be able to have a talk so
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
that the member can be talk to and I I
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
don't think we're going to be looking at
 
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
skirt length unless it's a micro skirt
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
in which casee maybe we should but I
 
00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
mean beyond
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
that I have faith in both sides being
 
00:34:07.589 --> 00:34:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
out further
 
00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:12.839 align:start position:0%
discussion Simpson
 
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
um having taught school sometimes I have
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
a little less Faith than you do
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative Smith um in how easily
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
this will be to work out so um I hope to
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
be included in conversations about how
 
00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to operationalize this
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
today well I was not going to talk on
 
00:34:39.149 --> 00:34:39.159 align:start position:0%
any of these but I I think on this one
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
um I mean I definitely agree
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
that along
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
with discipline and uh civility in the
 
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
house we
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
have gone downhill over the number of
 
00:34:58.829 --> 00:34:58.839 align:start position:0%
past number of years and I would not in
 
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
any way
 
00:35:04.109 --> 00:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
uh I'm looking at something that's
 
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
egregious which both sides have done in
 
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
the past three or four
 
00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
years um you know
 
00:35:16.349 --> 00:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
offensive t-shirts or things of that
 
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
nature that I've seen both sides wear or
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
um somebody coming in in Farmer jeans or
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
something like that I'm not going to uh
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
get involved in somebody that might come
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
in in a in a dress shirt and a jacket
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
and maybe have jeans on would that
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
probably not be proper attire yes but I
 
00:35:40.589 --> 00:35:40.599 align:start position:0%
think you know we have to use common
 
00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
sense here I think this is just a way
 
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
for us to stop the egregious stuff that
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
we've seen over the past few years and
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative Simpson I will
 
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:50.910 align:start position:0%
yes representative Simpson I will
consult

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
consult
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
so uh there's no further discussion
 
00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:04.839 align:start position:0%
motion is to adopt the N Amendment
 
00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:07.319 align:start position:0%

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.240 align:start position:0%

representative Simpson no representative
 
00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
eel representative Weber no
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
no amendment is recommended 5
 
00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:26.839 align:start position:0%
to4 the next is amendment to house rule
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr Speaker and committee
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
members I appreciate the opportunity to
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
introduce to you today my proposed
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
amendment to house rule 39b for the
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
record I am representative Diane power I
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of Brookline Mason
 
00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
in Greenville in Hillsboro County
 
00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:55.349 align:start position:0%
in Greenville in Hillsboro County
District

00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
District
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
36 so this proposed house rule is simple
 
00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
and straightforward it requires that all
 
00:37:05.069 --> 00:37:05.079 align:start position:0%
first drafts must be sent to the P to
 
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
the sponsor at least 10 days prior to
 
00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:11.720 align:start position:0%
the sign off deadline for all lsrs in
 
00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:12.630 align:start position:0%
the sign off deadline for all lsrs in
rule

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
rule
 
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
66 and the reason I'm proposing this is
 
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
in the past specifically last term I had
 
00:37:22.589 --> 00:37:22.599 align:start position:0%
the unfortunate experience of not having
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
a 10day sign off period for um
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
some of my
 
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
lsrs so by by way of example I received
 
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:37.640 align:start position:0%
the first draft of one of my lsrs the
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
day before the sign off
 
00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.069 align:start position:0%
day before the sign off
deadline

00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
00:37:46.109 --> 00:37:46.119 align:start position:0%
and I saw the email the next day and
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
therefore I I had less than 24 hours to
 
00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
review and to be able to sign off on
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
that LSR and as a result I I ended up
 
00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
losing co-sponsors so what I seek to do
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
with this proposed house rule amendment
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
is to minimally require that all first
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
drafts have the opportunity for that
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
10day sign off
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for taking my
 
00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:25.640 align:start position:0%
question um the um I agree with your
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
concern and with what's what's happening
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
oops may I respond so I I appreciate
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
that that um
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
observation um my thought with this is
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
that that this proposed house rule
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
change would help OS to prioritize their
 
00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
workflow and that you know like I said
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
they should they it would be beneficial
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
if they were to be able to prioritize
 
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
first drafts first rather than maybe
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
working on redrafts
 
00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
and the other comment that I would have
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
to um your observation is that with the
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
um I guess the what I call the rule 66
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
that deadline in
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
66 having extended time beyond that then
 
00:40:18.109 --> 00:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
I believe would impact the ability for
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
the clerk and the speaker to go through
 
00:40:23.309 --> 00:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
all the the bills and to be able to
 
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
assign them to committees so then you're
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
bumping up into another deadline
 
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
so I felt that this was the best way to
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
um deal with or address the
 
00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
you I I guess I'll just say that I mean
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
I I think we all agree that there's a
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate or or even a workable
 
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
solution like how how can you force
 
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
someone to do something that they can't
 
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.309 align:start position:0%
someone to do something that they can't
physically

00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
physically
 
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
do I don't know but I also don't know
 
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
that extent uh granting a grace period
 
00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
at at the end of the of um of the
 
00:41:22.589 --> 00:41:22.599 align:start position:0%
deadline is workable either because then
 
00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:25.400 align:start position:0%
then you set up an incentive to just not
 
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
do the work at all
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
until the last minute
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.910 align:start position:0%
 
do

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
Smith so I I think what they're getting
 
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.349 align:start position:0%
Smith so I I think what they're getting
at

00:41:40.349 --> 00:41:40.359 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
is the how do you enforce it how do you
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
tell the OS employees you now have 10
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
days less to do your work would you be
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
open to instead a simpler
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
change draft it in my head not not
 
00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
withstanding the provisions of house
 
00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.150 align:start position:0%
withstanding the provisions of house
rule

00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
rule
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
39b all sponsors shall have a 10-day
 
00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
sign off period on
 
00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
lsrs like we still want them to get
 
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
their work done on time and there are
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
going to be exceptions to that and we
 
00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
still want to have the 10
 
00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
days and try to have the speaker work
 
00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:17.480 align:start position:0%
with that staff to minimize the
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
occurrences this would come up in would
 
00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:21.559 align:start position:0%
that work for
 
00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative um I
 
00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate that feedback I I'm will
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
willing to support whatever the
 
00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
committee thinks is you know is best
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be my my
 
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
preference but I appreciate um working
 
00:42:43.309 --> 00:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
with the language that's here I I feel
 
00:42:46.589 --> 00:42:46.599 align:start position:0%
that some solution um needs to be
 
00:42:49.549 --> 00:42:49.559 align:start position:0%
proposed and like I stated before I feel
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a matter of
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
workflow in
 
00:42:58.510 --> 00:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
OS and for the record I did discuss this
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
um does the house clerk have any
 
00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh sorry weable yeah did you talk
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
about it with OS at all how they would
 
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
effectuate this thank you representative
 
00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:25.640 align:start position:0%
um no I did not I and the reason I
 
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
didn't is because this is the first rule
 
00:43:31.549 --> 00:43:31.559 align:start position:0%
change that I've ever proposed and um it
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear to me that that would be
 
00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
something that that I would be able to
 
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
discussion okay representative Smith for
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
motion I move to not adopt the power
 
00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:58.470 align:start position:0%
motion I move to not adopt the power

this is amendment to house
 
00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.069 align:start position:0%
this is amendment to house
rule

00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079 align:start position:0%
rule
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
Osborne yeah so um last spring we
 
00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
engaged in a number of meetings between
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
Republican and Democrat uh leadership uh
 
00:45:30.549 --> 00:45:30.559 align:start position:0%
discuss in various rule changes um
 
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
designed to speed up our work
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I get I would may use the phrase cut
 
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
to the chase so um we spend a lot of
 
00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:43.880 align:start position:0%
time uh hearing bills and debating bills
 
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
that we all know what the eventual
 
00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
outcome is going to be and we we do
 
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
these uh kind of year after year after
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
year so if uh there were ways that we
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
could all agree to kind of set those
 
00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
issues aside and and focus more of our
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
attention on uh more pressing issues I
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
think that would be a benefit this is
 
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
the only amendment that's been brought
 
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
forward that that was discussed in those
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
meetings and this would uh uh create a
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
new concept called a
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
tabling calendar where uh three quarters
 
00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
of a committee could vote to place a
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
bill on the table calendar uh without a
 
00:46:21.839 --> 00:46:22.790 align:start position:0%
bill on the table calendar uh without a
public

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
hearing and in order uh for that to be
 
00:46:28.109 --> 00:46:28.119 align:start position:0%
sent back to the Committee for Public
 
00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
hearing uh would require a simple
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
majority uh of the house to vote to do
 
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.309 --> 00:46:41.319 align:start position:0%
expiring Senator
 
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
wber thank you and
 
00:46:47.549 --> 00:46:47.559 align:start position:0%
I I was involved in those conversations
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
and initially thought that this was a
 
00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:51.640 align:start position:0%
pretty promising
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
notion and I guess my question is I want
 
00:46:58.750 --> 00:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
to explain explore a little more how the
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
process would go because while the
 
00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:04.829 align:start position:0%
process would go because while the
initial

00:47:04.829 --> 00:47:04.839 align:start position:0%
initial
 
00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
referral makes sense I I like the three
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
quarters I like the concept of not
 
00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
having to deal with stuff in committee
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
but I'm
 
00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
thinking about various times when
 
00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:20.200 align:start position:0%
members of a committee have been very
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
much on the same page and taken
 
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
something to the house only to find out
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
that the rest of the house wasn't even
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
reading the same book um and when that
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
happens um you've provided
 
00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
for something to be removed from the
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
tabling calendar just as we remove it
 
00:47:41.549 --> 00:47:41.559 align:start position:0%
from the consent
 
00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
calendar and uh
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
recommitted to the committee for further
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
consideration but it might have passed a
 
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
deadline which is why provided it is not
 
00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:55.960 align:start position:0%
passed the deadline and I think my
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
concern with with this is if the
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
majority of the house wants the thing
 
00:48:00.359 --> 00:48:01.630 align:start position:0%
majority of the house wants the thing
taken

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:01.640 align:start position:0%
taken
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
up uh and we're past the deadline for
 
00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
doing the committee
 
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
process uh then we're really real bind
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
and I think that the other thing is that
 
00:48:15.069 --> 00:48:15.079 align:start position:0%
if it's removed from the tabling
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
calendar and we have debate on the floor
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
and a vote on the floor and then it goes
 
00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:21.559 align:start position:0%
back to committee and it's scheduled for
 
00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
hearing I think the potential
 
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
for actually using more of the body's
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
time with this procedure than with the
 
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
current procedure of perhaps simply
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
scheduling something for a very brief
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
hearing and then an immediate executive
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
session um is
 
00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
is we're going to find that it's um
 
00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
going to take up more than our other
 
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
time than than we had hoped it would
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
save so um that's my concern with the
 
00:49:03.789 --> 00:49:03.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
formulation yeah just to respond so that
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
it could it certainly could be the case
 
00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
that uh it takes some time um um maybe
 
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
the clerk can correct me if I'm wrong
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
but the the motion to remove a bill from
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
the table wouldn't be um
 
00:49:21.789 --> 00:49:21.799 align:start position:0%
debatable if I'm if that's
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:32.789 --> 00:49:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
um this is a new thing uh we would need
 
00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:39.319 align:start position:0%
to establish whether that is a
 
00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:43.640 align:start position:0%
debatable uh situation or not um I I
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
would I would contend um that it
 
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be only for the sheer fact that
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
two table or to remove from the table is
 
00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
not a debatable
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
motion uh you could of course have
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiries uh but that that
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
rationale but may I ask a followup
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
question of the clerk question but that
 
00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
is following a vote of the Full House to
 
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
lay something on the table or to removed
 
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
from the table this is uh putting
 
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
something on the table at the
 
00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:19.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation of a single Committee of
 
00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
the house uh without any debate and I
 
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
realize we can change all of our rules
 
00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:30.599 align:start position:0%
at any time but uh one of the things
 
00:50:32.589 --> 00:50:32.599 align:start position:0%
that I am concerned
 
00:50:32.599 --> 00:50:36.470 align:start position:0%
that I am concerned
about

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
is unbelievably irritating as some of
 
00:50:44.109 --> 00:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
our debates are to me um removing all
 
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
possibility of debate of a bill from the
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
house is entirely against all of the
 
00:50:52.789 --> 00:50:52.799 align:start position:0%
Traditions that have been in place since
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
I've been here and um when I discuss
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
them with other
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
places um I find
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
that the more that people say are you
 
00:51:09.309 --> 00:51:09.319 align:start position:0%
out of your mind to do it that way the
 
00:51:12.349 --> 00:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
more I um I value that we do it our way
 
00:51:15.789 --> 00:51:15.799 align:start position:0%
irritating as it may be and the idea
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
that a a ma a super majority of a single
 
00:51:21.309 --> 00:51:21.319 align:start position:0%
committee can
 
00:51:25.349 --> 00:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
effectively um override the will of a
 
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
majority of a house or potentially is is
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
troubling to
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
me um and and again you know it didn't
 
00:51:36.789 --> 00:51:36.799 align:start position:0%
go on the table as a vote of our
 
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
house um it it goes on a newly created
 
00:51:47.309 --> 00:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
calendar um by a vote of committee and
 
00:51:50.349 --> 00:51:50.359 align:start position:0%
those are two different things so I I
 
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
just have real concerns about the
 
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
process and the advisability of the
 
00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
process just just to be clear my my
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
understanding would be um that the table
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
calendar to to adopt the recommendation
 
00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:07.720 align:start position:0%
would need a vote similar to the consent
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
calendar so it would be a um a vote of
 
00:52:14.109 --> 00:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
the house to put it on the table
 
00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
well but presumably prior to that there
 
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
is the removal of something from the
 
00:52:22.829 --> 00:52:22.839 align:start position:0%
calendar just as the the the chair
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
currently states are there any bills to
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
be removed from the consent calendar and
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not that would be debatable
 
00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
is is the debatable question right now I
 
00:52:33.789 --> 00:52:33.799 align:start position:0%
I think we could clarify that yeah uh
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
with language if you wanted to well my
 
00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
suggestion would be not to do it but I I
 
00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
I do note that clarifying that might be
 
00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:44.870 align:start position:0%
I do note that clarifying that might be
helpful

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:48.680 align:start position:0%
but further discussion representative
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
Smith so I don't know maybe the clerk
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
can check me if for being correct or not
 
00:52:55.950 --> 00:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
if we pass a deadline then you just make
 
00:52:57.870 --> 00:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
a motion to suspend house rules and so
 
00:52:59.470 --> 00:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
far as to allow the recommitment of the
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
bill right you can do that thank you and
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
further question Mr Speaker further
 
00:53:04.079 --> 00:53:05.710 align:start position:0%
further question Mr Speaker further
question

00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:05.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:53:09.069 --> 00:53:09.079 align:start position:0%
and really only matters in year two
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
right because in year one the committee
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
gets it back but it's too late to act
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
can't they just vote to
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
retain yes thank
 
00:53:23.309 --> 00:53:23.319 align:start position:0%
you Senator Weber and the problem with
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
that is if it's something that needs
 
00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:29.720 align:start position:0%
immediate action there's an issue and
 
00:53:33.789 --> 00:53:33.799 align:start position:0%
if um you know what was contemplated
 
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
here was a majority of the
 
00:53:42.109 --> 00:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
house acting on the bill and the
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
scenario that you are postulating
 
00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
requires a super majority to be able to
 
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
recommit it so again you are taking away
 
00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:53.480 align:start position:0%
the majority of the house if it is the
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
will of the majority but not a super
 
00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:01.510 align:start position:0%
will of the majority but not a super
majority

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:05.549 --> 00:54:05.559 align:start position:0%
Osborne right um yes uh so first of all
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
there's nothing's preventing the house
 
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
from acting
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
on the removal of these uh bills from
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
the uh tabling calendar um prior to the
 
00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:20.069 align:start position:0%
the uh tabling calendar um prior to the
deadline

00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
there's we we meet multiple times before
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
um before the deadline expires right um
 
00:54:29.789 --> 00:54:29.799 align:start position:0%
also so if uh it comes to be that this
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
process is more cumbersome than it's
 
00:54:34.589 --> 00:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
worth to deal with we don't have to use
 
00:54:34.599 --> 00:54:36.150 align:start position:0%
worth to deal with we don't have to use
it

00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
and and maybe uh and maybe we don't but
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
it is just a tool to add to the tool box
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
guess I would only say at this point
 
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
that we have been
 
00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
talking about this for a not this
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
particular thing but ways to try and
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
streamline our process of the extreme
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
number of bills that we've been getting
 
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:07.720 align:start position:0%
year after
 
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
year and it's getting to the point where
 
00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
um we're going to have trouble uh
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
retaining members we're going to have
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
trouble getting members to sit on a
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
committee and it's going to get more and
 
00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
more difficult if we don't find some
 
00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:25.480 align:start position:0%
ways to start reducing the number of
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
bills that every committee has to
 
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
hear uh and I think this is a way we we
 
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
discussed it quite a bit um you know
 
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
when we were meeting earlier and uh I I
 
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
just think it's worth giving it a try
 
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
and I still think there's other things
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
we have to look into and try and figure
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
out how we're going to uh uh stop the uh
 
00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:50.799 align:start position:0%
excessive number of bills that we're
 
00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:53.720 align:start position:0%
getting every year and I just feel that
 
00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
this is a at least one one first step if
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work we can we can get rid of
 
00:56:02.589 --> 00:56:02.599 align:start position:0%
it but I think it's worth a
 
00:56:02.599 --> 00:56:04.750 align:start position:0%
it but I think it's worth a
try

00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
try
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
yes I guess I might be a little bit
 
00:56:10.029 --> 00:56:10.039 align:start position:0%
confused um this talks about um the
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
committee placing it on the U table
 
00:56:16.349 --> 00:56:16.359 align:start position:0%
calendar um by a 3/4 vote does that
 
00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
table calendar then get voted on by the
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
entire house because I don't see that
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
here it does not say that the table
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
calendar must be approved by a majority
 
00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh well uh yes that's that's the
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
intention I guess it would just suggest
 
00:56:41.789 --> 00:56:41.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
view uh Mr clerk do you have a uh yes Mr
 
00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Speaker I I Mr chairman I would
 
00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:51.160 align:start position:0%
suggest that the the way this was
 
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
crafted uh is intending to mirror the
 
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
language of the consent calendar and and
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
and that it is um it is mirrored
 
00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:03.640 align:start position:0%
essentially the same way we're not we're
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
not um we're not talking about doing a
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
different a different mechanism um again
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
if if if it would be better clarified we
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
change further
 
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
discussion Z Smith for a
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
motion I move to accept the Osborne
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:29.789 --> 00:57:29.799 align:start position:0%
there a
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:43.549 --> 00:57:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
roll Mr Mr chairman could I just take
 
00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
one quick second just to um to laay
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
representative uh Sullivan's concerns
 
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
the current house rule 52 which does
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
discuss the consent calendar um does not
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
not specifically address that when we
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
talk about the order of business uh we
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
talk about the uh adoption of the
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
consent calendar so uh that's that's
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
clarification sorry the question is on
 
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:16.760 align:start position:0%

the

00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
clerk uh thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Smith try to
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
fake the sincerity at least the um this
 
00:59:04.589 --> 00:59:04.599 align:start position:0%
is this is a a a change that I had
 
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
proposed to representative Smith all it
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
does is um uh basically put into uh
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
reality what our practice has been for
 
00:59:14.829 --> 00:59:14.839 align:start position:0%
the last several years we used to hand
 
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
out gray
 
00:59:20.349 --> 00:59:20.359 align:start position:0%
folders um and and which was a a um
 
00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
which basically had a staple of the bill
 
00:59:26.109 --> 00:59:26.119 align:start position:0%
inside of it and which uh was kept in
 
00:59:27.789 --> 00:59:27.799 align:start position:0%
the committee drawers here in the
 
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
Legislative Office Building uh they were
 
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
docketed by the clerk's teams and um
 
00:59:34.109 --> 00:59:34.119 align:start position:0%
eventually destroyed by the office of
 
00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
legislative Services um and several
 
00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
years ago our practice uh became such
 
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
that um we essentially just said uh the
 
00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
Chairman's copy would be a copy of the
 
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
bill uh just as every member received a
 
00:59:51.309 --> 00:59:51.319 align:start position:0%
copy of the bill um and this this is
 
00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:53.480 align:start position:0%
really just a housekeeping amendment to
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
to just say that after each bill has
 
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
been numbered uh we'll procure a
 
00:59:59.549 --> 00:59:59.559 align:start position:0%
sufficient number of copies we don't we
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
don't need to um we I I have boxes and
 
01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:05.240 align:start position:0%
boxes of these gray folders that that
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
have uh Fallen by the wayside but this
 
01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
was a um this was a uh discussion
 
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
between uh committee Services um the
 
01:00:15.309 --> 01:00:15.319 align:start position:0%
Senate clerk's office my office many
 
01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:17.480 align:start position:0%
years ago uh and that's why that process
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
has changed so we uh we were just
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
suggesting a quick update to
 
01:00:22.559 --> 01:00:27.109 align:start position:0%
suggesting a quick update to
housekeeping

01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%

100 proposed by representative Dan

01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.029 --> 01:01:52.039 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr Speaker I'm
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative Alvin C from marac County
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
District 26 which is iial District which
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
includes lden and seven other
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
towns U this particular rule change is
 
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh intended
 
01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.230 align:start position:0%
uh intended
to

01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:07.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
um um ensure that uh when the house is
 
01:02:14.269 --> 01:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
asked to vote to concur or non-c concur
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
on a on a bill that's returned from the
 
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
Senate that uh it's been considered
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
carefully because once we take a uh a
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
vote on that
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
uh the bill either goes straight to the
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
governor or
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
goes uh into the dust bin of History
 
01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
without any uh further recourse so uh
 
01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
the idea here is that uh 20 sets of eyes
 
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
would be preferable to just one or two
 
01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
sets of eyes looking at any particular
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
bill that was returned to us
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
um this bill allows for the uh chairman
 
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
to recommend the committee of conference
 
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
because we do get another bite at the
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
Apple uh after a committee of
 
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
conference uh
 
01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:07.559 align:start position:0%
also on occasion the uh the other body
 
01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
puts in uh amendments that we might
 
01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
consider non gerain even if they don't
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
concern them so um such that if not
 
01:03:20.109 --> 01:03:20.119 align:start position:0%
carefully noticed might allow something
 
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
to pass that maybe should have been uh
 
01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
considered more carefully or possibly by
 
01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
a different policy
 
01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
committee um because it might have been
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
something that we would consider a
 
01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
different committee's action the uh
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
impetus for me to uh put this in was uh
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
early this spring we had House Bill 154
 
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
which the senate had taken a bill from
 
01:03:51.269 --> 01:03:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh Municipal and County of uh
 
01:03:56.829 --> 01:03:56.839 align:start position:0%
government and amended it to be a um
 
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
election law Bill a 32p part bill for
 
01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
election law and when it came to the
 
01:04:08.549 --> 01:04:08.559 align:start position:0%
floor for a vote there was uh actually
 
01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
ended up being two different motions one
 
01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
to Concur and one to uh ask for a
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
committee of conference from two
 
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
different committee chairs so that was a
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
little confusing we ended up voting to
 
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
Concur and it was presented to us as
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
strictly house keeping although I think
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
it looked more complicated than just
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
housekeeping uh therefore I hope this
 
01:04:35.710 --> 01:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
rule addition will be able to uh provide
 
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
more clarity and be reinsuring to the
 
01:04:41.069 --> 01:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
members that uh any bill that's come
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
from the Senate return from the Senate
 
01:04:46.109 --> 01:04:46.119 align:start position:0%
has uh been carefully looked at before
 
01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
we get a
 
01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.670 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Smith
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
thank you so just so I'm
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
clear this passes chairs can no longer
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
concur non-c concur without having a
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
vote of the committee that would that
 
01:05:07.829 --> 01:05:07.839 align:start position:0%
would be the intent follow up for
 
01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
question all right so in a case which
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
happens all the time where there's
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
something we want really badly from the
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
Senate and we make a deal we say okay
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
look you need to do this you hold up
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
your your end will concur with this you
 
01:05:23.269 --> 01:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
don't want that to happen
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
anymore I don't know the circumstance is
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
of any hypothetical so um and I haven't
 
01:05:32.269 --> 01:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
been involved in a situation like that
 
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
so I don't know the answer to
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
that although question one more yeah so
 
01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
um let me try to explain it better
 
01:05:43.269 --> 01:05:43.279 align:start position:0%
because it happens all the time um I'll
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
go with a not recent
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
example we had made an agreement with
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
Senate transportation that they were
 
01:05:52.269 --> 01:05:52.279 align:start position:0%
going to concur with something and
 
01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
exchange there was something we didn't
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
particularly care about but I let them
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
them think we did so we were going to
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
hold that up if we didn't get what the
 
01:06:03.870 --> 01:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
house wanted from them deals done on the
 
01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
day of voting on those Committee of
 
01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.549 align:start position:0%
day of voting on those Committee of
conference

01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
conference
 
01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
reports the um the Senate ended up not
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
holding up their end it failed on the
 
01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:14.799 align:start position:0%
floor I had about 7 minutes to make a
 
01:06:17.309 --> 01:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
decision walk back to the house floor
 
01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
and decide to non-c concur to let them
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
know that we were
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
serious you would prefer that I ask for
 
01:06:25.109 --> 01:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
a house recess convene my committee for
 
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
a vote I mean I don't understand how
 
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
this is going to
 
01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
work okay I was not uh fully aware of
 
01:06:34.829 --> 01:06:34.839 align:start position:0%
the behind the scenes dealings that
 
01:06:34.839 --> 01:06:36.069 align:start position:0%
the behind the scenes dealings that
might

01:06:36.069 --> 01:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
occur um but I was very concerned
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
about bills coming to the house the Full
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
House and we're suddenly told by a
 
01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
committee chair yes we vote Yes on this
 
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
or no on this one and not giving much of
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
a reason and it's not been very clear so
 
01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
I just found that um that part that
 
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:14.029 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
Stringham yes uh thank you so I just
 
01:07:27.549 --> 01:07:27.559 align:start position:0%
wanted to there is a timing thing that's
 
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
that's a it's a possible problem with
 
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
this idea because we're talking about
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
bills right at the very end right at the
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
very end of the session um but it seems
 
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
to me it's not that bad right we we
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes have uh lunchtime
 
01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:49.160 align:start position:0%
announcements or end of the day
 
01:07:52.029 --> 01:07:52.039 align:start position:0%
announcements where a chair will say my
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
committee is going to meet for exec
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
session following this session or during
 
01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
lunch and and they have a quick exec
 
01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
session on a bill so it is quite
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
possible to uh to squeeze things in in
 
01:08:09.549 --> 01:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
in that sense right so um I I don't know
 
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
about your seven minute example right
 
01:08:14.589 --> 01:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
but but in general you know this can be
 
01:08:20.269 --> 01:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.229 --> 01:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
so any comments question yeah I I just I
 
01:08:28.269 --> 01:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
just uh I have the same same basic view
 
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
that uh in particular uh concern is when
 
01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
uh there's been any kind of significant
 
01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
uh change that uh that may lead to
 
01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
another policy committee needing to look
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
at something that uh just
 
01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
having uh having a reasonable uh
 
01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:48.799 align:start position:0%
discussion with the committee uh before
 
01:08:51.870 --> 01:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
moving forward um Can can prevent a
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
major mistake so that's a one of the
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:09.430 align:start position:0%

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:11.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%

Amendment here a
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
second second General wbor seconds

J

01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
Weber this is another one of these
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
things that in theory I'm very much in
 
01:09:41.070 --> 01:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
favor of um and in fact
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
when because this is the only time I've
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
been privy to these discussions uh under
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
the speakers that were Democratic Speers
 
01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
that I served under which is all of them
 
01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
um there was always a
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
policy expressed by the speaker to the
 
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
committee chairs which was that the
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
committee chairs were going to poll
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
their members on concurrences or non-c
 
01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
concurrences and that happened
 
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
informally um and often at the last
 
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
minute and and um and I actually think
 
01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
that was a good thing I
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
think so in that respect I'm for this um
 
01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
I do do want to just recognize though
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
that uh as this is written it doesn't
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
deal with the problems of the bills to
 
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
which other bills have been attached
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
which drive all of us fairly crazy
 
01:10:43.229 --> 01:10:43.239 align:start position:0%
because it goes back to the original
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
committee and whether or not it has any
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
of the original
 
01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
committee's content on it or
 
01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
not um and
 
01:10:58.229 --> 01:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
and that's not very helpful um so in in
 
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
many ways I would hope that the speaker
 
01:11:04.750 --> 01:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
would establish a policy that says that
 
01:11:06.669 --> 01:11:06.679 align:start position:0%
members of all the Committees involved
 
01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
get at least
 
01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
um I admit that this is another one of
 
01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
those things that's a troubling piece of
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:27.790 --> 01:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
so just be just um see you know webs and
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
that has been my uh direction to the
 
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
Committees is that they do everything in
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
their power to try and make sure that
 
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
the committee members especially you
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
know the ranking member is notified and
 
01:11:44.629 --> 01:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
spoken to before any decision is made
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
and that has been standing but as
 
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
representative Smith points out
 
01:11:52.990 --> 01:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes that's not possible so uh I I
 
01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
think that's why
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
this this is a little troubling for
 
01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
those circumstances where we have to get
 
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
our business done and this could uh
 
01:12:06.629 --> 01:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
hinder us a little bit in in doing that
 
01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
but uh that has been my direction to
 
01:12:12.149 --> 01:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
committees uh right along is that they
 
01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
uh do everything in their power to make
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
sure that the Committees and especially
 
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
like I said the ranking memb is uh is uh
 
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
okay I think we have a motion
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
right there's no further discussion
 
01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
Court will read the uh read the the
 
01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
motion is to uh not
 
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
accept representative Packard no yes on
 
01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
the motion not to yeah representative
 
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
Smith yes representative duet yes
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
represent Osborne yes represent Sweeney
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
yes represent Simpson yes represent yes
 
01:12:59.709 --> 01:12:59.719 align:start position:0%
represent Weber yes represent Sullivan
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:11.870 --> 01:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
Z uh this is amendment to house rule
 
01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:12.790 align:start position:0%
Z uh this is amendment to house rule
number

01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:13:15.629 --> 01:13:15.639 align:start position:0%
10 uh proposed by representative Maguire
 
01:13:15.639 --> 01:13:17.189 align:start position:0%
10 uh proposed by representative Maguire
and

01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
stringle all
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
right I was about to do the other one so
 
01:13:22.159 --> 01:13:23.430 align:start position:0%
right I was about to do the other one so
let

01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
let
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
me okay
 
01:13:29.550 --> 01:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you uh Mr Speaker
 
01:13:33.629 --> 01:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
so uh this this is just something that's
 
01:13:33.639 --> 01:13:34.430 align:start position:0%
so uh this this is just something that's
a

01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's a matter of of style or um taste
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
or something like that um we in debate
 
01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
are are forbidden by Masons for of
 
01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
mentioning the senate or the governor in
 
01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
our debate right so so people get around
 
01:13:56.629 --> 01:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
it by saying people through the wall or
 
01:13:59.629 --> 01:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
the other body or the whatever and and
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's awkward and so um the purpose of
 
01:14:07.629 --> 01:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
this rules amendment is to allow th
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
those discussions and debate um
 
01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
now and it's really I don't know just to
 
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
me the rule as it currently exists is a
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
is a limitation on
 
01:14:25.709 --> 01:14:25.719 align:start position:0%
speech and and it just it it feels
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable it it's just I I've never
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
seen the point of it it's important to
 
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
legislation um I mean either at the end
 
01:14:36.669 --> 01:14:36.679 align:start position:0%
of the day a bill is either going to
 
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
become law or it's not right and so the
 
01:14:42.629 --> 01:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
entire process of legislation is
 
01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
something of Interest right not just
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
that what the house wants to do but what
 
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
the entire legislature and Governor want
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
to do with a particular piece of piece
 
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
of legislation and so
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
um and especially when you're
 
01:14:59.110 --> 01:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
considering amendments or maybe floor
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
amendments and that kind of thing they
 
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
might have relevance to what's going to
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
happen to a bill down the line so um
 
01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
that's the main point of this is just to
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
allow people to
 
01:15:15.629 --> 01:15:15.639 align:start position:0%
discuss um discussions they've had with
 
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
senators or Governor or whatever as part
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
of their debate and you know I can see
 
01:15:24.629 --> 01:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
how this is not to everybody's taste I
 
01:15:24.639 --> 01:15:26.510 align:start position:0%
how this is not to everybody's taste I
mean

01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
I know the our clerk is not in favor of
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
this because it's something that's um
 
01:15:35.709 --> 01:15:35.719 align:start position:0%
you know essentially Universal right I
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
mean no other state as far as we know
 
01:15:41.709 --> 01:15:41.719 align:start position:0%
does this and so on um
 
01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
but just in the interest of of freeing
 
01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
up our speech I think we can try it if
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
turns out it's not you know it's not
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
that great two years from now you can
 
01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
change it right so um anyway yeah thanks
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
you know for for me this is a matter of
 
01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
decorum and respect uh I respect the
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
Senate I respect the governor but I
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
respect the people who put a lot of time
 
01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
into preparing uh to inform us about a
 
01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
specific issue and ask for our support
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
and a vote and so many times it seems
 
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
like uh in the middle of making a point
 
01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
um the think become awkward and they
 
01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
have to talk about the other body and uh
 
01:16:31.709 --> 01:16:31.719 align:start position:0%
you kind of get away from the point
 
01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
they're trying to make while you're
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
sitting there concentrating and um uh
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
you know realizing how much time and
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
effort theyve put into this just the the
 
01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:43.400 align:start position:0%
use of a non- dirty word in fact a
 
01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
wonderful word like Senate uh you know
 
01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
sh should be allowed in our great body
 
01:16:51.669 --> 01:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know provided all the uh other
 
01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
rules of of decorum and respect were
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
followed and I see no reason to uh to
 
01:17:01.229 --> 01:17:01.239 align:start position:0%
Blacklist that word um uh as part of
 
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
debate in any format so that's why I
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
supported and work with representative
 
01:17:09.149 --> 01:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
Maguire on this and bring this to you
 
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration and
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you all for working here today by
 
01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
Weber just as a point of the Byzantine
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
nature of our rules uh what is the point
 
01:17:30.629 --> 01:17:30.639 align:start position:0%
of re
 
01:17:30.639 --> 01:17:32.550 align:start position:0%
of re
of

01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
um making an exception for one part of
 
01:17:40.270 --> 01:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
Masons which would then change our
 
01:17:43.229 --> 01:17:43.239 align:start position:0%
debate without
 
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
also addressing the issue that our
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
custom usage in precedent is a higher
 
01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
order of authority in our rules than is
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
Mason's Mason is below our custom usage
 
01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
in president which has for forever been
 
01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
not to utter the words and to use a
 
01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:04.870 align:start position:0%
not to utter the words and to use a
separate

01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
separate
 
01:18:08.629 --> 01:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
location and my second question is if
 
01:18:10.590 --> 01:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
you put all that time and effort into an
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
argument can you not when you write it
 
01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
out the first time write it out with the
 
01:18:18.910 --> 01:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
other side of the wall or um some other
 
01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:21.560 align:start position:0%
location that might let people know what
 
01:18:23.629 --> 01:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
you're talking about let me answer the
 
01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
second question first which
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
is to me reading this in
 
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
Masons using the other side of the wall
 
01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
and all that sort of stuff that is sort
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
of prohibitive you see what I mean it's
 
01:18:41.229 --> 01:18:41.239 align:start position:0%
talking about the other body that's that
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
what is what um it's not the word so
 
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
much as it is the concept right it's
 
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's like you know we're self-contained
 
01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
we should have our own opinions and so
 
01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:53.709 align:start position:0%
we should have our own opinions and so
on

01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:18:56.590 --> 01:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
versus what's happening outside in that
 
01:19:01.149 --> 01:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
sense so so I would tend to think I mean
 
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
in general we let people do that but but
 
01:19:05.189 --> 01:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
I think that's against the spirit of the
 
01:19:07.229 --> 01:19:07.239 align:start position:0%
rule now your first question about the
 
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
way this is drafted I'm going to defer
 
01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
to the clerk who helped us with it
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
so I I don't have a good answer for
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
that uh just to for clarity Mr Speaker
 
01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
um custom usage in precedent does uh
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
come above our parliamentary guide um
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
however the Parliamentary guide um
 
01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
specifically Mason's manual has been our
 
01:19:34.030 --> 01:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
parliamentary guide uh since about the
 
01:19:38.629 --> 01:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
50s um and the reason um in in terms of
 
01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
of debate specifically uh where the
 
01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
guide is specific and custom usage in
 
01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
precedent has involved has in has
 
01:19:51.310 --> 01:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
evolved to include that uh if you accept
 
01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
the the the provision of the manual
 
01:19:58.350 --> 01:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's where that custom has has
 
01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
evolved from um so I I as as the member
 
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh from Epsom said uh I I did advise uh
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
against this in general uh because of
 
01:20:15.390 --> 01:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
the um the sort of universally accepted
 
01:20:18.669 --> 01:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
um provision that we don't talk about
 
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
the executive or the other branch of the
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
of the legislature um but I but in in
 
01:20:28.629 --> 01:20:28.639 align:start position:0%
terms of uh uh the very specifics of of
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
custom usage in precedent I I I don't
 
01:20:35.629 --> 01:20:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
discussion okay yeah represent Smith
 
01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.189 align:start position:0%
discussion okay yeah represent Smith
thank

01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
you I hate people on the other side of
 
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
the wall it's a euphemism and I'd be
 
01:20:52.270 --> 01:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
very happy if we started geling people
 
01:20:54.669 --> 01:20:54.679 align:start position:0%
for that I don't know may maybe people
 
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
disagree but I see the point of the rule
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
as we should focus on our own work and
 
01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
not worry about what everyone else is
 
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
doing and produce the distilled position
 
01:21:05.229 --> 01:21:05.239 align:start position:0%
of the house that's not the end of the
 
01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
process right then it goes to the Senate
 
01:21:10.110 --> 01:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
what if they don't like it I don't care
 
01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
if they don't like it while I'm building
 
01:21:14.669 --> 01:21:14.679 align:start position:0%
it once it gets there now I care deeply
 
01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
and that's why sponsors should follow
 
01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
their bills committees should follow the
 
01:21:20.110 --> 01:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
committee chairs should follow their
 
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
bills on the other side and that's what
 
01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
amendments are for that's what
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
committees have conf Es are for that's
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
why invested Representatives who think
 
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
there might be a problem with the
 
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
governor should then be reaching out to
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
the governor none of that should be used
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
to convince me I just want to know if
 
01:21:38.669 --> 01:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
the Bill's a good idea in the house or
 
01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
not so I don't know I support what we do
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
now and I'd actually like to see it
 
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
comment Smith for motion
 
01:21:57.629 --> 01:21:57.639 align:start position:0%
I move to not adopt the Maguire
 
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
Stringham amendment to house rule to
 
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
Second it's been moved and seconded is
 
01:22:08.669 --> 01:22:08.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
discussion okay with that the clerical
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
call a rooll the question is to excuse
 
01:22:17.709 --> 01:22:17.719 align:start position:0%
me not not recommend represent Packard
 
01:22:20.189 --> 01:22:20.199 align:start position:0%
yes representative Smith yes
 
01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
representative duet
 
01:22:24.669 --> 01:22:24.679 align:start position:0%
yes representative Osborne yes represent
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
Sweeney yes represent Simpson yes
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%

01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
90 the next is amendment to house rule
 
01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
47f uh proposed by Representatives Dan
 
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
Maguire and
 
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
Stringham thank you Mr Speaker so this
 
01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
one is has some similarity to uh the C
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment but it's uh it's for an
 
01:22:59.629 --> 01:22:59.639 align:start position:0%
earlier um situation which is when a
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
when a bill is destined to go to a
 
01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
second committee the chair of that
 
01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
committee currently has the power to
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
Simply wave the bill away and if they do
 
01:23:10.990 --> 01:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
that then the bill would go in its
 
01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
current form over to the Senate um and
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
or or if it's a Senate bill it would go
 
01:23:21.709 --> 01:23:21.719 align:start position:0%
then um I guess to the governor right
 
01:23:23.709 --> 01:23:23.719 align:start position:0%
because or or back to the senate for
 
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
deciding if they're going to do a
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
committee of conference or not so in any
 
01:23:30.990 --> 01:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
case it's it's for cases where a bill is
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
scheduled to go to a second committee
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
but the second committee's chair doesn't
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
want to deal with it okay and uh both of
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
us are members of the finance committee
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
so we get this situation all the time
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
that that a lot of bills come to us as a
 
01:23:48.510 --> 01:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
second committee and
 
01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:52.719 align:start position:0%
um this is simply that we don't want
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
mistakes made right right and and
 
01:23:58.030 --> 01:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
whenever there's sort of one person
 
01:23:58.040 --> 01:23:59.470 align:start position:0%
whenever there's sort of one person
who's

01:23:59.470 --> 01:23:59.480 align:start position:0%
who's
 
01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
um who's the definitive person on what
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
happens to a bill that person you know
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
inadvertently can make a mistake whereas
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
if a whole committee makes a decision
 
01:24:13.629 --> 01:24:13.639 align:start position:0%
there's much less chance that something
 
01:24:15.629 --> 01:24:15.639 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
overlooked um we had a situation like
 
01:24:20.830 --> 01:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
that last time I I won't necessarily get
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
into it but um it's just a matter
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
of um let's have uh more people think
 
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
about a bill um than just one person and
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
especially when when there this is not a
 
01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
situation where there's a house vote
 
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
after they make this decision because
 
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
after they make this decision it's gone
 
01:24:45.310 --> 01:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
right it's it's it's the end of the line
 
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
for that bill um and uh so it's it's
 
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
really as simple as
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
that yeah
 
01:24:58.189 --> 01:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
largely uh have follow the same same uh
 
01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
line uh you know will say there was a
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
case where my understanding is that an
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
original Bill did not have a lot of uh
 
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
Financial consequences to it it was
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
waved off second committee uh uh even
 
01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:14.719 align:start position:0%
and as soon as that's done it's in the
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
Senate uh Finance never got to address
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
it and had Fairly significant
 
01:25:22.229 --> 01:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
implications to the budget wouldn't have
 
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
been hard to uh have a uh a polling of
 
01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
Finance in that case um seems to me um
 
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
committee chairs uh work hard to get a
 
01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
good committee with them it's worth
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
worth getting the input and uh uh
 
01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
respecting the process uh to get it
 
01:25:42.750 --> 01:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
right uh and uh still with reasonable
 
01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:46.280 align:start position:0%
timetables so um in terms of waving off
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
second committee bills um uh this is one
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
that two of us were planning to bring
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
forward uh to you all regardless of of
 
01:25:58.109 --> 01:25:58.119 align:start position:0%
which uh party was in control uh that we
 
01:26:01.790 --> 01:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
felt uh that a mistake had been made uh
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
last term and uh this was a reasonable
 
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
remedy so I hope hope you'll uh go
 
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
you questions from Weber I would just
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
say that I'm I'm very much in favor of
 
01:26:20.910 --> 01:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
this one simply because
 
01:26:25.109 --> 01:26:25.119 align:start position:0%
um I think we've all had the situation
 
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
where um bills have real implications
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
for several committees and uh for
 
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
example um you know some of the Health
 
01:26:39.550 --> 01:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
and Human Services committee bills go to
 
01:26:43.149 --> 01:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
other cons committees and we have
 
01:26:45.390 --> 01:26:45.400 align:start position:0%
thought that there would be a robust
 
01:26:48.510 --> 01:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
discussion of whatever the other issues
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
were in another committee only to find
 
01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
that that committee chair has uh waved
 
01:26:56.830 --> 01:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
the bill off and it it it's not always
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
Finance although it's often Finance
 
01:27:01.229 --> 01:27:01.239 align:start position:0%
because they're the most usual second
 
01:27:03.629 --> 01:27:03.639 align:start position:0%
committee but uh I'm thinking of any
 
01:27:05.790 --> 01:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
number of our bills that go to Edna or
 
01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
other committees where our assumption on
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
the policy committee is we don't have to
 
01:27:15.790 --> 01:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
deal with that because it's not our area
 
01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:16.790 align:start position:0%
deal with that because it's not our area
of

01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:27:21.310 --> 01:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
expertise and it's uh not something that
 
01:27:23.310 --> 01:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
we want to spend a lot of our time on
 
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
because we may get it horribly wrong and
 
01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
then to have only one member of the next
 
01:27:30.669 --> 01:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
committee get to make that decision is
 
01:27:30.679 --> 01:27:31.510 align:start position:0%
committee get to make that decision is
sometimes

01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
01:27:34.669 --> 01:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
discouraging so I would I would urge
 
01:27:39.390 --> 01:27:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:55.199 --> 01:27:57.470 align:start position:0%
 
represent

01:27:57.470 --> 01:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
smth I move to not adopt the Maguire
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:05.550 align:start position:0%
 
47f

01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
47f
 
01:28:10.510 --> 01:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
second been moved and seconded further
 
01:28:13.390 --> 01:28:13.400 align:start position:0%
discussion Senator
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
Smith there are always one-offs I just
 
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
don't believe that this has
 
01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
risen as a problem to the level that we
 
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
need to take away tools of chairman one
 
01:28:28.109 --> 01:28:28.119 align:start position:0%
the cases where we have to move
 
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
fast you you wave it off it's still
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
going to go to the Senate you can still
 
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
amend the thing if you're still not
 
01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
happy you can still request a committee
 
01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
of conference you can non-c concur it's
 
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
not like it's the end of the process
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
there so I don't support
 
01:28:47.109 --> 01:28:47.119 align:start position:0%
this further discussion s
 
01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
Simpson thank you Mr chair um I am
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
actually thinking about the timing as
 
01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
well and think that this doesn't have
 
01:28:57.109 --> 01:28:57.119 align:start position:0%
the same timing problem as the previous
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment because it would be before
 
01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
um it would this would have to happen
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
before the second committee deadline so
 
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't have the same issue as the
 
01:29:11.669 --> 01:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
other one did so I will be
 
01:29:19.109 --> 01:29:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
thank represent
 
01:29:23.629 --> 01:29:23.639 align:start position:0%
Weber and I think that you know I'm just
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
beat a dead horse a little bit and say
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
oh great you know we don't want to talk
 
01:29:32.590 --> 01:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
about what the Senate does but we want
 
01:29:36.189 --> 01:29:36.199 align:start position:0%
to leave what the Senate does we want to
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
Omit a whole layer of house
 
01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
input and send it direct to the Senate
 
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
with the hope that the Senate will do it
 
01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
right and as we all know the Senate is
 
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
not as good as we are at
 
01:29:57.510 --> 01:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
looking very care carefully at um the
 
01:30:02.950 --> 01:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
granular layers of things um so I I
 
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
think that anytime we ensure that both
 
01:30:10.709 --> 01:30:10.719 align:start position:0%
of the Committees get a look is good and
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
I certainly have
 
01:30:12.639 --> 01:30:14.709 align:start position:0%
I certainly have
seen

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:14.719 align:start position:0%
seen
 
01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
occasionally a time when I think that
 
01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:19.350 align:start position:0%
occasionally a time when I think that
the

01:30:19.350 --> 01:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
um declining of a bill has been used on
 
01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
a very political basis so
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm I'm in favor of the two
 
01:30:30.669 --> 01:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
committee referrals and I think we
 
01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
should uh depart from that in very very
 
01:30:36.189 --> 01:30:36.199 align:start position:0%
few circumstances because there's a
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
looks reble thank you um Mr Speaker Mr
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
chair um I'm gonna vote against the
 
01:30:52.270 --> 01:30:52.280 align:start position:0%
motion because I support this but if the
 
01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
which I assume if the motion
 
01:30:57.550 --> 01:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
passes I hope at some level maybe the
 
01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
speaker could encourage committee chairs
 
01:31:03.790 --> 01:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
to get the input of their committees in
 
01:31:07.109 --> 01:31:07.119 align:start position:0%
the decision on whether or not to wave a
 
01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:17.229 --> 01:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:22.119 align:start position:0%
um I didn't want to interrupt okay um I
 
01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
um completely agree with with the
 
01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
representative eel I think that um I can
 
01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
instruct when we have our Chairman's
 
01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
training to uh make sure that they do
 
01:31:36.109 --> 01:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
they do every effort to make sure that
 
01:31:37.870 --> 01:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
they uh contact the rest of the
 
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
committee and again especially the
 
01:31:42.149 --> 01:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
ranking member to make sure that uh
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
they're not doing something that the
 
01:31:46.990 --> 01:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
full committee would be against but I I
 
01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:49.480 align:start position:0%
hate to take
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
away the tools of a uh of a chairman um
 
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
in a situation that might only exist
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
twice was one may I ask the clerk a
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
question yeah about how this would work
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
so um so we meet on
 
01:32:12.669 --> 01:32:12.679 align:start position:0%
Thursday bill is voted
 
01:32:15.109 --> 01:32:15.119 align:start position:0%
on uh the second committee decides to
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
meet on Friday to vote on whether
 
01:32:23.070 --> 01:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
to um decline so what happens to that
 
01:32:24.510 --> 01:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
bill at that point does it go directly
 
01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:26.719 align:start position:0%
to the senate or does it have to come
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
back to the body to
 
01:32:33.149 --> 01:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
be again thank you for the question um
 
01:32:36.189 --> 01:32:36.199 align:start position:0%
so what happens currently is when a bill
 
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
is sent to a second committee um and it
 
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
is referred uh there um the bill stays
 
01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
in our possession uh if I receive
 
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
notification that the chair has waved
 
01:32:51.510 --> 01:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
the second committee referral um that
 
01:32:54.189 --> 01:32:54.199 align:start position:0%
notice gets read on the floor at the
 
01:32:57.790 --> 01:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
next session date and the bill goes on
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
the third reading list for that date um
 
01:33:03.870 --> 01:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
and that it is then at the end of that
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
next session date transmitted to the
 
01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:06.750 align:start position:0%
next session date transmitted to the
other

01:33:06.750 --> 01:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:33:08.910 --> 01:33:08.920 align:start position:0%
body just the followup and it would be
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
on that day then it would be available
 
01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
for reconsideration motion for example
 
01:33:20.590 --> 01:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
so no
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
because when it has been assigned to a
 
01:33:25.390 --> 01:33:25.400 align:start position:0%
second committee it is no longer in the
 
01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
possession of the
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
house it is in the possession of the
 
01:33:35.149 --> 01:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
committee so that's why sometimes when
 
01:33:38.430 --> 01:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
when you see uh the speaker um on the
 
01:33:40.590 --> 01:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
floor address a bill having been sent to
 
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
a second committee and a member will
 
01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
jump up and instantly move
 
01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
reconsideration the me the motion's not
 
01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
in order because the bill is therefore
 
01:33:49.470 --> 01:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
not in the possession of the house
 
01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
anymore is in the possession of the
 
01:33:55.109 --> 01:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
committee when the bill um
 
01:33:58.030 --> 01:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
when the bill is back so to speak and
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
that the the chair has waved the
 
01:34:02.830 --> 01:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
referral of the second committee it is
 
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
put on the third reading list in theory
 
01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
um you could do something with it but
 
01:34:11.109 --> 01:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
then again we have a bigger problem
 
01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
because of notice of
 
01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
reconsideration um and uh we're getting
 
01:34:18.990 --> 01:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
into an area where I'm not really
 
01:34:21.390 --> 01:34:21.400 align:start position:0%
comfortable giving you an answer without
 
01:34:24.030 --> 01:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
giving you uh more time reason this is
 
01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:35.629 --> 01:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
Weber argue that it is workable
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
because um the issues of notice and and
 
01:34:42.030 --> 01:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
reconsideration are very valid ones so
 
01:34:45.870 --> 01:34:45.880 align:start position:0%
that part is could be an issue but
 
01:34:49.149 --> 01:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
unlike the other discussions that we
 
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
have had
 
01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:52.629 align:start position:0%
have had
where

01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's important that something happened
 
01:35:00.510 --> 01:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
very quickly and our deadlines
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
forbid whatever the next thing that we
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
were offering to have happen
 
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
happen the
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
motion the the declining of the referral
 
01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:12.610 align:start position:0%
of the bill has to
 
01:35:12.610 --> 01:35:13.750 align:start position:0%
of the bill has to
[Music]

01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
come at least I often it happens
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
immediately like 10 minutes after the
 
01:35:23.229 --> 01:35:23.239 align:start position:0%
house is voted um and the clerk has
 
01:35:25.629 --> 01:35:25.639 align:start position:0%
reminded me that no I can't get up and
 
01:35:28.109 --> 01:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
ask for reconsideration because it's not
 
01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:29.679 align:start position:0%
in the possession of the house because
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
I've made that mistake a number of times
 
01:35:32.639 --> 01:35:34.229 align:start position:0%
I've made that mistake a number of times
uh

01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
but because these the the bill has to
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
have been acted on by the house in the
 
01:35:43.629 --> 01:35:43.639 align:start position:0%
first instance before the deadline and
 
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
we have the whole rest of the time for
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
the bill to be acted on by the second
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
committee which is built into our
 
01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
schedule there is time to have this
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
discussion with the committee if our
 
01:36:04.830 --> 01:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
rules require it so um I don't see the
 
01:36:07.709 --> 01:36:07.719 align:start position:0%
possibility of
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
um I don't see the possibility of it
 
01:36:14.430 --> 01:36:14.440 align:start position:0%
interfering with our work I do see the
 
01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
possibility uh and I think that
 
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative Osborne has outlined it
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
quite well of how things can go wrong if
 
01:36:23.790 --> 01:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
if the committee chair gets it wrong and
 
01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
we we can't as a as a committee or as
 
01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:40.109 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

01:36:40.109 --> 01:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you um okay so the committee
 
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
votes that they're going to wave off on
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
the bill is it now a bill not in a
 
01:36:55.990 --> 01:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:57.470 --> 01:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
let's say it only add two it goes
 
01:37:00.629 --> 01:37:00.639 align:start position:0%
someplace and then Finance Finance waves
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
off the committee votes yes we're going
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
to wave off is it now a one committee
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
bill I mean the the situation is that
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
the yes it's it's no longer a
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
a two committee bill in the sense that
 
01:37:20.350 --> 01:37:20.360 align:start position:0%
that the committee has waved off um it
 
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
was assigned that way uh at the
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
beginning of the process all bills when
 
01:37:28.629 --> 01:37:28.639 align:start position:0%
they are assigned are assigned at the
 
01:37:31.629 --> 01:37:31.639 align:start position:0%
beginning uh as to when it's going
 
01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
whether it will be a second committee
 
01:37:36.510 --> 01:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
bill or not okay follow up question so
 
01:37:37.470 --> 01:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:40.189 --> 01:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
so one committee or not if it goes to
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
that process it is always a bill going
 
01:37:44.830 --> 01:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
to a second committee whether it is or
 
01:37:49.149 --> 01:37:49.159 align:start position:0%
not as far as deadlines go correct all
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
bills all bills that are second
 
01:37:52.750 --> 01:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
committee bills are designated as early
 
01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:57.430 align:start position:0%
committee bills are designated as early
bills

01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
questions there have none per will call
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
a roll the question is to not adopt the
 
01:38:15.629 --> 01:38:15.639 align:start position:0%

01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative Carol
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
Maguire uh thank you very much uh um
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
representing this bill this this um uh
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
rule request is is really about uh
 
01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
respect and deorum uh I very much
 
01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate your comment about uh wanting
 
01:39:06.189 --> 01:39:06.199 align:start position:0%
to motivate uh people to be in the
 
01:39:10.669 --> 01:39:10.679 align:start position:0%
legislature uh and work hard and uh um
 
01:39:13.550 --> 01:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
you know see see uh fruits from what
 
01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
they do uh the
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
circumstance of this rule change it's a
 
01:39:22.030 --> 01:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
very difficult one uh to um uh put
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
together a a request change uh to
 
01:39:28.229 --> 01:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
totally modify it because uh the reason
 
01:39:30.310 --> 01:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
deals with the committee of conference
 
01:39:33.149 --> 01:39:33.159 align:start position:0%
and uh the reasons uh that we want
 
01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
unanimity out of the committee of
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
conference are very very
 
01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
good uh so the circumstances here uh is
 
01:39:46.589 --> 01:39:46.599 align:start position:0%
that um uh um is uh one member uh is
 
01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
assigned to the committee of conference
 
01:39:53.790 --> 01:39:53.800 align:start position:0%
um uh quickly agrees to maybe house or
 
01:39:56.669 --> 01:39:56.679 align:start position:0%
Senate version uh of of a bill that's
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
been worked on in the case uh one that I
 
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
worked on I wasn't the prime sponsor was
 
01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
actually somebody from the other party
 
01:40:05.870 --> 01:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
who we worked very hard uh first uh
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
introducing in the house getting through
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
the house getting through the Senate a
 
01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
minor change in the Senate uh went to
 
01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference at the uh um
 
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
close to the last minute um one member
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
was changed um the committee of
 
01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
conference was very short uh the sign
 
01:40:27.229 --> 01:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
off uh uh came out uh and the the one
 
01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
individual just never signed off on it
 
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
um and that it's a circumstance of I
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
guess you call it a parliamentary
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
maneuver uh but you know in terms of
 
01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
what it means for the people who work on
 
01:40:43.390 --> 01:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
the bill they work on writing it they uh
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
certainly the case for me I was uh I
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
testified when it was introduced into a
 
01:40:51.870 --> 01:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
house committee not my committee um and
 
01:40:55.629 --> 01:40:55.639 align:start position:0%
uh followed it to the Senate also spoke
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh at its introduction in the Senate uh
 
01:41:01.390 --> 01:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
passed both both Chambers with strong
 
01:41:03.310 --> 01:41:03.320 align:start position:0%
bipartisan majority almost three
 
01:41:07.790 --> 01:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
quarters and the um uh uh the final
 
01:41:09.669 --> 01:41:09.679 align:start position:0%
disposition out of Committee of
 
01:41:13.229 --> 01:41:13.239 align:start position:0%
conference uh is just no sign off uh
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
there's there was nothing in the
 
01:41:17.669 --> 01:41:17.679 align:start position:0%
committee of conference to indicate that
 
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh what the reason was uh and why uh
 
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
this fruitless work
 
01:41:26.669 --> 01:41:26.679 align:start position:0%
uh should have progressed that way and I
 
01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:29.159 align:start position:0%
don't think that's good uh respect for
 
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
for our members uh efforts uh I don't
 
01:41:36.270 --> 01:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
think it's proper decorum uh and I I
 
01:41:38.229 --> 01:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
think there's only C certain
 
01:41:40.109 --> 01:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
circumstances where we can do something
 
01:41:42.270 --> 01:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
about it uh the purpose of this rule
 
01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
change is to you know if we get to a
 
01:41:47.550 --> 01:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
committee of conference and uh the
 
01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:48.709 align:start position:0%
committee of conference and uh the
agreement

01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
between uh all the all the members is uh
 
01:41:53.870 --> 01:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
to accept you know you know the house or
 
01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:54.790 align:start position:0%
to accept you know you know the house or
Senate

01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
01:41:57.589 --> 01:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
version um and everybody agrees then
 
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
that gives the chairman the ability to
 
01:42:04.430 --> 01:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
to sign off on it because there's no uh
 
01:42:07.149 --> 01:42:07.159 align:start position:0%
I you know I don't think we can delay it
 
01:42:08.830 --> 01:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
if there's going to be rewrites even
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
though Committee of conference normally
 
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
is to accept one version or the other
 
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's a compromise between
 
01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:14.430 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's a compromise between
the

01:42:14.430 --> 01:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
two so um I both wanted to um you know
 
01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:22.679 align:start position:0%
Express um you know what what some of
 
01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
the my concerns are about using that
 
01:42:28.669 --> 01:42:28.679 align:start position:0%
kind of a maneuver in general uh but
 
01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
also you know suggest that under certain
 
01:42:34.390 --> 01:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances you know if if uh there's
 
01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
good reasons um you know i' I've gone to
 
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
I've been on Committee of conference or
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
and had only one person object and they
 
01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
tell me their reasons they're they're
 
01:42:46.149 --> 01:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
empowered to do it I respect that and I
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate appreciate knowing and I feel
 
01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
like uh the time the time that the
 
01:42:52.910 --> 01:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
representatives the legislators put into
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
it are well spent and um uh you know
 
01:42:59.910 --> 01:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
worth worth coming coming back to get
 
01:43:03.070 --> 01:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
beat up again on so uh that's what this
 
01:43:06.109 --> 01:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
this rule change um is meant to do is it
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
at least provide some
 
01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh where um um where an an
 
01:43:14.669 --> 01:43:14.679 align:start position:0%
objecting member of a committee of
 
01:43:18.589 --> 01:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
conference would have uh you know the be
 
01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
given the courtesy to say in front of
 
01:43:23.709 --> 01:43:23.719 align:start position:0%
everybody what what exactly the uh the
 
01:43:25.709 --> 01:43:25.719 align:start position:0%
reasons are perhaps they could be talked
 
01:43:27.669 --> 01:43:27.679 align:start position:0%
out of it perhaps
 
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
so discussion representative Smith thank
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
you so in the rule change does chair
 
01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:49.109 align:start position:0%
 
confires

01:43:49.109 --> 01:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
yes um follow question y so right now
 
01:43:56.109 --> 01:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
the leaders of both caucuses can sign
 
01:43:58.669 --> 01:43:58.679 align:start position:0%
off for any of their members it sounds
 
01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
like in this case somebody failed to do
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
that because of that you don't think we
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
should encourage them to use the process
 
01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
and instead have rules
 
01:44:11.709 --> 01:44:11.719 align:start position:0%
change I'm I'm fuzzy on that I mean we
 
01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
can already sign off for anybody matter
 
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
of fact if somebody decides in bad faith
 
01:44:20.430 --> 01:44:20.440 align:start position:0%
to hose the process and isn't going to
 
01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
sign the speaker is free to replace them
 
01:44:25.589 --> 01:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
put someone else on and have them sign
 
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
so yeah I you know I think the
 
01:44:30.910 --> 01:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances when this happens is
 
01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
usually uh the individual and and
 
01:44:36.189 --> 01:44:36.199 align:start position:0%
whoever is representing the speaker
 
01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
probably both agree uh to not sign off
 
01:44:44.589 --> 01:44:44.599 align:start position:0%
on the bill and and I believe um and uh
 
01:44:48.510 --> 01:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
in speaking with um uh Carol Maguire who
 
01:44:53.189 --> 01:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
also um was part of this uh rule change
 
01:44:56.350 --> 01:44:56.360 align:start position:0%
amendment process too is is that uh
 
01:44:59.149 --> 01:44:59.159 align:start position:0%
under you know extreme circumstances
 
01:45:03.629 --> 01:45:03.639 align:start position:0%
this is a strategy uh to you know uh end
 
01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
the life of the bill so and as a speaker
 
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
working together with a person who's um
 
01:45:13.070 --> 01:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
or acting speaker uh with the person is
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
in the committee and it doesn't stop
 
01:45:16.990 --> 01:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
them from doing that but it it does
 
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
provide a uh an environment where at
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
least everybody who's in there can hear
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
what the reasons
 
01:45:27.629 --> 01:45:27.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:31.470 --> 01:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
you further discussion in
 
01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
avable well all I was going to say is
 
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
that um at Committees of conference many
 
01:45:41.109 --> 01:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
times it's a you know a verbal
 
01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
discussion and there is consensus at the
 
01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
committee of conference that X Y and Z
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
have been agreed upon and um it's not
 
01:45:54.390 --> 01:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
always the case even though there may be
 
01:45:57.070 --> 01:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
good will it's not or probably is
 
01:45:59.390 --> 01:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
Goodwill uh it may always it's not
 
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
always the case that what is in the
 
01:46:06.149 --> 01:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
written word is an a correct um
 
01:46:08.589 --> 01:46:08.599 align:start position:0%
reflection of what the discussion was in
 
01:46:11.149 --> 01:46:11.159 align:start position:0%
the opinion of the person that is a
 
01:46:14.350 --> 01:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
conferee that would be signing and I
 
01:46:18.550 --> 01:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
think in some respect this takes away
 
01:46:22.629 --> 01:46:22.639 align:start position:0%
the um the opportunity and the right of
 
01:46:25.629 --> 01:46:25.639 align:start position:0%
the conferee to read and agree with the
 
01:46:28.990 --> 01:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
context I mean if they ultimately don't
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
agree obviously they could be replaced
 
01:46:34.870 --> 01:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
or whatever but um maybe it's the lawyer
 
01:46:37.470 --> 01:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
in me but I don't always have faith that
 
01:46:39.629 --> 01:46:39.639 align:start position:0%
things are written down exactly the way
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
they're um agreed whether intentionally
 
01:46:46.350 --> 01:46:46.360 align:start position:0%
or not and so that's why I would
 
01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
struggle to support this I understand
 
01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
repr senat
 
01:46:54.830 --> 01:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
Weber I I'm mostly seconding what
 
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative eel said but I think
 
01:47:02.350 --> 01:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
given your stated aims one of the issues
 
01:47:04.149 --> 01:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
might be the signature but I don't think
 
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
the signature is the real problem um the
 
01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:11.560 align:start position:0%
speaker can either for very respectable
 
01:47:13.629 --> 01:47:13.639 align:start position:0%
means when you have a Committee Member
 
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
who is acting in bad faith replace the
 
01:47:18.109 --> 01:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
Committee Member the speaker can also if
 
01:47:20.589 --> 01:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
they choose to do so torpedo something
 
01:47:22.350 --> 01:47:22.360 align:start position:0%
by removing a Committee Member and
 
01:47:25.870 --> 01:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
appointing somebody won't won't sign so
 
01:47:27.589 --> 01:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
that goes either way and this does
 
01:47:31.470 --> 01:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
nothing to address that but I think the
 
01:47:34.629 --> 01:47:34.639 align:start position:0%
overriding concern and and one that I
 
01:47:37.149 --> 01:47:37.159 align:start position:0%
know is a matter of great discussion
 
01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719 align:start position:0%
among our caucus members is if you serve
 
01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
on a committee of conference it is
 
01:47:46.270 --> 01:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely your duty to read and now of
 
01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:48.159 align:start position:0%
course everything's online so you can do
 
01:47:49.669 --> 01:47:49.679 align:start position:0%
that without having to drive all the way
 
01:47:51.629 --> 01:47:51.639 align:start position:0%
to conquer and get your phisical
 
01:47:54.030 --> 01:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
signature you you can read the bill
 
01:47:58.750 --> 01:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
online and direct either somebody in
 
01:48:01.270 --> 01:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
your uh party or somebody in the
 
01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
speaker's office to do the signature but
 
01:48:07.390 --> 01:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
I think having that check that more than
 
01:48:10.109 --> 01:48:10.119 align:start position:0%
one set of eyes has got to take a good
 
01:48:13.870 --> 01:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
look at the bill is really important and
 
01:48:15.629 --> 01:48:15.639 align:start position:0%
I don't think as
 
01:48:19.070 --> 01:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
drafted this measure really
 
01:48:20.910 --> 01:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
addresses the problem that you're
 
01:48:22.390 --> 01:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about and I think there are a
 
01:48:24.350 --> 01:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
lot of things to be concerned about with
 
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference process I
 
01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
just haven't figured out a way to get
 
01:48:30.750 --> 01:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
through that
 
01:48:34.030 --> 01:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
particular set of issues that does it
 
01:48:36.990 --> 01:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
better um with all the frustrations that
 
01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
I think all of us have with it so um I I
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
too am am not in favor of this
 
01:48:46.750 --> 01:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
formulation but thank you for raising
 
01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:49.560 align:start position:0%

you thank you Mr Speaker and thank you
 
01:49:47.229 --> 01:49:47.239 align:start position:0%
members of The Rules Committee for
 
01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:50.360 align:start position:0%
taking a look at my proposal I think
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
that everyone here would agree that
 
01:49:57.149 --> 01:49:57.159 align:start position:0%
there is um Credence in names uh on how
 
01:49:59.790 --> 01:49:59.800 align:start position:0%
how how you you uh you know name things
 
01:50:02.149 --> 01:50:02.159 align:start position:0%
and I think in the in the case of our uh
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
committee I think everyone would agree
 
01:50:07.390 --> 01:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
that energy has been in the Forefront of
 
01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
the news for many many years
 
01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
internationally nationally uh the even
 
01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire gubernatorial
 
01:50:16.149 --> 01:50:16.159 align:start position:0%
elections energy has been at the
 
01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
Forefront of a lot of um discussions so
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh my proposal to make a modest change
 
01:50:26.709 --> 01:50:26.719 align:start position:0%
to the name of our committee to change
 
01:50:29.470 --> 01:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
it to the to the the committee on energy
 
01:50:31.870 --> 01:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
Science and Technology I think
 
01:50:33.990 --> 01:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
recognizes the importance and the
 
01:50:36.750 --> 01:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
Credence that this committee would would
 
01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
be focusing on and has been focusing on
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
for several years uh for instance um
 
01:50:45.870 --> 01:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
ever since uh my first term uh we have
 
01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
had many bills that are energy related
 
01:50:50.589 --> 01:50:50.599 align:start position:0%
and the exponential increase in the
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
number of them in proportion to our bus
 
01:50:56.430 --> 01:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
bills in total has increased is is quite
 
01:50:59.629 --> 01:50:59.639 align:start position:0%
evident uh in fact uh if I look at the
 
01:51:03.149 --> 01:51:03.159 align:start position:0%
lsrs for coming up this year um I
 
01:51:05.390 --> 01:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
predict that approximately of the 40
 
01:51:07.589 --> 01:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
bills that are likely to come to my
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
committee give or take 37 of them are
 
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
energy or energy related including the
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
cost of electricity uh type of bills
 
01:51:19.830 --> 01:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
that are foremost in our our news every
 
01:51:23.470 --> 01:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
single year so I believe by putting the
 
01:51:26.709 --> 01:51:26.719 align:start position:0%
word energy first in in our committee uh
 
01:51:30.189 --> 01:51:30.199 align:start position:0%
shows U the people shows the rest of the
 
01:51:33.390 --> 01:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
country that our committee is focused on
 
01:51:36.030 --> 01:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
energy uh in in our committee as being
 
01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
one of the foremost uh issues that we
 
01:51:40.589 --> 01:51:40.599 align:start position:0%
face of our times here and I think and
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
for some time I think uh the Senate has
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
recognized that because their name is
 
01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
the committee on energy and natural
 
01:51:50.350 --> 01:51:50.360 align:start position:0%
resources and in fact if you look at the
 
01:51:52.750 --> 01:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
committee description as it is even now
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
the word energy comes first in in the
 
01:51:58.069 --> 01:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
description so it kind of makes sense at
 
01:52:00.030 --> 01:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
this time that we that we put energy
 
01:52:02.109 --> 01:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
first I've conferred with several
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
members on this issue and you know they
 
01:52:07.390 --> 01:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
they said it it makes sense the chair my
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
good friend from eeping uh is totally
 
01:52:12.870 --> 01:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
behind this change and my good friend
 
01:52:15.430 --> 01:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
from Hollis who is likely to be the
 
01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
ranking member is also not opposed to it
 
01:52:20.270 --> 01:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
uh this proposal thinks it's it's a good
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
idea so I think it's time that we do to
 
01:52:24.069 --> 01:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
make this change and I hope the rules
 
01:52:26.350 --> 01:52:26.360 align:start position:0%
committee agrees that we can change our
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
name to put more emphasis on what we
 
01:52:30.350 --> 01:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
really do on a on a day-to-day basis
 
01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
here thank
 
01:52:34.669 --> 01:52:34.679 align:start position:0%
you Senator
 
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and I thank you for that
 
01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:38.870 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and I thank you for that
explanation

01:52:38.870 --> 01:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
01:52:41.870 --> 01:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
because um it highlights the assumption
 
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
that I made when I read this which was
 
01:52:49.189 --> 01:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
that um there has always been a concern
 
01:52:50.830 --> 01:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
for the Committees on the back end of
 
01:52:53.709 --> 01:52:53.719 align:start position:0%
the alphabet that
 
01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps they do get you know their bills
 
01:53:00.270 --> 01:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
heard at the end of the day when things
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
are uh tired and grumpy and um I had
 
01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
assumed that this was an effort to get
 
01:53:11.109 --> 01:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
the very complicated and complex issues
 
01:53:15.910 --> 01:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
heard by the committee moved forward in
 
01:53:19.069 --> 01:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:22.639 align:start position:0%
and your explanation is very clear and I
 
01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
have no objection to changing that on
 
01:53:30.390 --> 01:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
that term but I am very concerned that
 
01:53:34.069 --> 01:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
we are going to hear requests from
 
01:53:36.669 --> 01:53:36.679 align:start position:0%
various other committees and I you know
 
01:53:39.950 --> 01:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means comes to mind as to a
 
01:53:42.430 --> 01:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
name change that would not keep them at
 
01:53:45.669 --> 01:53:45.679 align:start position:0%
the end of the calendar and I'm already
 
01:53:48.589 --> 01:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
wondering if Affairs of the elderly and
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
health and human services might be a
 
01:53:52.750 --> 01:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
good way to go for the committee on
 
01:53:55.830 --> 01:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
which I've been privileged to serve uh
 
01:54:00.990 --> 01:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
so I don't have any objection in per se
 
01:54:03.189 --> 01:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
in changing the name of the committee
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
but I would ask the speaker and I think
 
01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
there's already been conversation about
 
01:54:10.870 --> 01:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
this and I know that speaker narelli
 
01:54:12.510 --> 01:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
made it a regular
 
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
practice uh to start with different
 
01:54:18.069 --> 01:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
places in the calendar when the calendar
 
01:54:20.910 --> 01:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
is written and when it's sent to the me
 
01:54:24.149 --> 01:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
Members so that we know that that um
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
this this week instead of starting with
 
01:54:28.149 --> 01:54:28.159 align:start position:0%
a we're going to start a quarter of the
 
01:54:30.669 --> 01:54:30.679 align:start position:0%
way through the alphabet next week we're
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
going to start 2third of the way through
 
01:54:35.310 --> 01:54:35.320 align:start position:0%
the alphabet and and the next week we're
 
01:54:36.510 --> 01:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
going to start at the end of the
 
01:54:39.189 --> 01:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
alphabet I hope that that rotation would
 
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
be adopted whatever we do with this rule
 
01:54:45.390 --> 01:54:45.400 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm concerned otherwise that
 
01:54:49.950 --> 01:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
the perception will be um and and maybe
 
01:54:52.030 --> 01:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
I got got hold of the entire wrong end
 
01:54:53.790 --> 01:54:53.800 align:start position:0%
of the stick but I know that I was not
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
the only person who had this perception
 
01:54:58.990 --> 01:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
was that the the real purpose is is a
 
01:55:01.069 --> 01:55:01.079 align:start position:0%
more favorable place in the calendar and
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
I think that all of us ought to serve in
 
01:55:08.669 --> 01:55:08.679 align:start position:0%
the rotation of those that get to
 
01:55:10.830 --> 01:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
present our bills first and and who have
 
01:55:13.750 --> 01:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
to wait later on so that's just my
 
01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:16.719 align:start position:0%
thought on the whole thing well I um I
 
01:55:18.669 --> 01:55:18.679 align:start position:0%
agree with you that the perception could
 
01:55:20.910 --> 01:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
be that way in fact it it turns out to
 
01:55:23.870 --> 01:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
be a it would be a a happy coincidence
 
01:55:26.310 --> 01:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
in many situations where it would put us
 
01:55:28.990 --> 01:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
further up in the calendar however as I
 
01:55:31.270 --> 01:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
looked more into it I really started
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
thinking that the way it's written now
 
01:55:37.109 --> 01:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
it almost puts energy as an afterthought
 
01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
in our committee and it's not uh energy
 
01:55:42.550 --> 01:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
is first and foremost in our community
 
01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
we we spend 90 over 90% of our time
 
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
working on energy bills and I think that
 
01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
if this was uh you know explained to
 
01:55:53.189 --> 01:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
people in the way that I'm explaining it
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
now I think many people would understand
 
01:55:59.709 --> 01:55:59.719 align:start position:0%
that the name of something does have
 
01:56:01.629 --> 01:56:01.639 align:start position:0%
importance and by putting the word
 
01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
energy in front of of this committee's
 
01:56:07.709 --> 01:56:07.719 align:start position:0%
name tells people that we are the
 
01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
committee of energy and Science and
 
01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
Technology but energy has been at the
 
01:56:16.109 --> 01:56:16.119 align:start position:0%
foremost of all of our bills almost osly
 
01:56:19.629 --> 01:56:19.639 align:start position:0%
slow so uh over the years and and I
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
think the real impetus is that it we
 
01:56:24.270 --> 01:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
should recognize that fact by making a
 
01:56:26.229 --> 01:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
name change that properly and
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
importantly reflects what this committee
 
01:56:31.310 --> 01:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
currently is you know does thank you for
 
01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:32.669 align:start position:0%
currently is you know does thank you for
the

01:56:32.669 --> 01:56:32.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:32.679 --> 01:56:34.470 align:start position:0%
the
explanation

01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
01:56:39.510 --> 01:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:41.830 --> 01:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
intentions sorry that's that's just it's
 
01:56:44.270 --> 01:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
not appropriate for any committee but I
 
01:56:46.550 --> 01:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
do want to ask though is this isn't free
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
did you figure out um in proposing this
 
01:56:51.870 --> 01:56:51.880 align:start position:0%
what the cost and effort and money is
 
01:56:53.669 --> 01:56:53.679 align:start position:0%
going to be license plate design
 
01:56:55.870 --> 01:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
business cards plaes on the wall
 
01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
Weatherhead um website updates all of
 
01:57:03.229 --> 01:57:03.239 align:start position:0%
that well no uh I I figured the license
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
plates haven't been done yet so perhaps
 
01:57:08.109 --> 01:57:08.119 align:start position:0%
uh that change would be made prior to
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
any expense I did look at the fact that
 
01:57:13.990 --> 01:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
many rsas do refer to the committee of
 
01:57:16.669 --> 01:57:16.679 align:start position:0%
science techn energy my thought process
 
01:57:19.390 --> 01:57:19.400 align:start position:0%
on that was since the name change is
 
01:57:22.750 --> 01:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
merely a reversal of words and not any
 
01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
significant change in the name itself
 
01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
that any current RSA could not mistake
 
01:57:30.750 --> 01:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
what the committee is whether it's
 
01:57:32.910 --> 01:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
Science Tech energy or energy Science
 
01:57:35.310 --> 01:57:35.320 align:start position:0%
and Tech uh it it would it would mean
 
01:57:37.709 --> 01:57:37.719 align:start position:0%
the same thing and as we go forward in
 
01:57:40.990 --> 01:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
life uh as some rsas make changes they
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
can they can certainly do some
 
01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
housekeeping changes to uh clean up that
 
01:57:47.149 --> 01:57:47.159 align:start position:0%
end of it but I I I did think in terms
 
01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
of the rsas whether a report has to be
 
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
given to the chair of the Science Tech
 
01:57:55.310 --> 01:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
SC science technology and energy chair
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
or to the chair of the energy Science
 
01:57:59.430 --> 01:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
and Technology I don't think there would
 
01:58:01.470 --> 01:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
be any mistake in in where it has to go
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
to in that respect so I don't think
 
01:58:07.229 --> 01:58:07.239 align:start position:0%
there's any room for confusion on that
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
end Mr clerk thank you Mr Speaker just a
 
01:58:12.510 --> 01:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
couple of points of clarification
 
01:58:15.069 --> 01:58:15.079 align:start position:0%
regarding representative Smith's
 
01:58:17.550 --> 01:58:17.560 align:start position:0%
question this change would not be acted
 
01:58:20.069 --> 01:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
on until the 8th of January all
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
legislation will have been introduced at
 
01:58:26.550 --> 01:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
that point so all bills for this year
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
will say science technology and energy
 
01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
um all uh all records thereof will say
 
01:58:35.310 --> 01:58:35.320 align:start position:0%
that this will this is
 
01:58:38.069 --> 01:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
prospective uh amendments are just to
 
01:58:40.430 --> 01:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
rules are just like laws they are not
 
01:58:45.069 --> 01:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
retrospective uh so um in order to um it
 
01:58:46.470 --> 01:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
would affect the second year of the
 
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
session in terms of what's appearing on
 
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
legislation uh for what what bills are
 
01:58:52.669 --> 01:58:52.679 align:start position:0%
signed to
 
01:58:55.390 --> 01:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
this committee um so really this will
 
01:58:58.270 --> 01:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
not change and and and historically
 
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
license plates will have been handed out
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
at that point as well um so uh that is
 
01:59:06.910 --> 01:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
what it is but um just for clarity um
 
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
this is this would affect going forward
 
01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
after January 8th and so there are some
 
01:59:15.189 --> 01:59:15.199 align:start position:0%
implications specific to legislation uh
 
01:59:17.189 --> 01:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
bills that are being drafted right now
 
01:59:20.109 --> 01:59:20.119 align:start position:0%
that may have uh Science Tech and energy
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
written in the bills with
 
01:59:25.870 --> 01:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
uh need to be amended um if if the name
 
01:59:32.310 --> 01:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:35.950 --> 01:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
clarity bble and just following along
 
01:59:38.470 --> 01:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
with what representative Smith said and
 
01:59:40.270 --> 01:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
what you said I imagine there are
 
01:59:42.350 --> 01:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
statutes at this point that refer to the
 
01:59:45.870 --> 01:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
committee at this point in this way as
 
01:59:49.229 --> 01:59:49.239 align:start position:0%
well so but I do also really believe
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
that there's going to start to be
 
01:59:53.149 --> 01:59:53.159 align:start position:0%
competition among the Committees for
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
changing their name so they get further
 
02:00:00.189 --> 02:00:00.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:09.599 --> 02:00:12.669 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

02:00:12.669 --> 02:00:12.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:18.030 --> 02:00:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:21.310 --> 02:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
motion I move to table the amendment to
 
02:00:23.189 --> 02:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
house rule 30 the Thomas amendment to
 
02:00:26.830 --> 02:00:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
31 we're not allowed to what
 
02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
now can't do
 
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:38.750 --> 02:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
know well in that case I move to not
 
02:00:40.350 --> 02:00:40.360 align:start position:0%
recommend the Thomas amendment to house
 
02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:42.830 align:start position:0%
recommend the Thomas amendment to house
rule

02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:45.350 --> 02:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
31 I'll make the
 
02:00:48.589 --> 02:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
motion I'm good I'm the da I'll explain
 
02:00:48.599 --> 02:00:49.870 align:start position:0%
motion I'm good I'm the da I'll explain

02:00:49.870 --> 02:00:49.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:55.550 --> 02:00:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
question clerical caller roll the the
 
02:01:00.990 --> 02:01:01.000 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker or Mr chairman uh two points
 
02:01:32.589 --> 02:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
under other
 
02:01:38.830 --> 02:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
business um Mr Mr chairman um through a
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
miscommunication uh I had worked with
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative Reed on a few amendments
 
02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
to house rules uh she was here earlier
 
02:01:50.669 --> 02:01:50.679 align:start position:0%
uh in discussion with her yesterday I
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
misunderstood uh her intention of
 
02:01:54.589 --> 02:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
whether or not those would be presented
 
02:01:59.189 --> 02:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
today or on the 8th of January um and I
 
02:02:02.430 --> 02:02:02.440 align:start position:0%
got it wrong uh she was here earlier to
 
02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
discuss those um and she had to leave
 
02:02:08.790 --> 02:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
for work and uh I am sorry for that I
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
messed that up it is it is completely on
 
02:02:14.589 --> 02:02:14.599 align:start position:0%
me and I apologize uh to the committee
 
02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639 align:start position:0%
uh for that
 
02:02:21.069 --> 02:02:21.079 align:start position:0%
um the second uh item is in discussion
 
02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh regarding the Osborne Amendment um
 
02:02:30.270 --> 02:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
and when uh I was speaking uh addressing
 
02:02:32.350 --> 02:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan's concerns uh
 
02:02:34.629 --> 02:02:34.639 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the current rule 52 about
 
02:02:39.310 --> 02:02:39.320 align:start position:0%
the voting um I realized uh in looking
 
02:02:40.870 --> 02:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
at the amendment from representative
 
02:02:43.109 --> 02:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
Osborne that I
 
02:02:45.950 --> 02:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
missed um in house rule
 
02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
58 the order of business uh Edition
 
02:02:52.470 --> 02:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
where it currently
 
02:02:56.069 --> 02:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
States um the orders of how we operate
 
02:02:59.109 --> 02:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
and number eight is consideration of
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
consent calendar items number nine is
 
02:03:03.229 --> 02:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
report from standing and select
 
02:03:06.270 --> 02:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
committees um so uh representative
 
02:03:09.189 --> 02:03:09.199 align:start position:0%
Osborne I will draft a floor Amendment
 
02:03:12.109 --> 02:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
um unless the committee uh would be
 
02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
interested in in allowing that but
 
02:03:18.270 --> 02:03:18.280 align:start position:0%
that's entirely up to you um to
 
02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
basically uh have a consideration of the
 
02:03:26.510 --> 02:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
table calendar items as well um because
 
02:03:29.589 --> 02:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
and again that is that is my fault and
 
02:03:31.870 --> 02:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
and I apologize to the committee for
 
02:03:40.910 --> 02:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:43.790 --> 02:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
one you're an amendment yeah I'm fine
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:54.030 --> 02:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
so is
 
02:03:56.549 --> 02:03:56.559 align:start position:0%
um is representative Reed going to
 
02:04:00.189 --> 02:04:00.199 align:start position:0%
present her amendments on as a floorman
 
02:04:01.830 --> 02:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
I I will work with her to make sure that
 
02:04:07.390 --> 02:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:09.669 --> 02:04:09.679 align:start position:0%
8th is there any other business to come
 
02:04:26.589 --> 02:04:26.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:28.750 --> 02:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman just checking with the
 
02:04:41.390 --> 02:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
requests I I believe this I believe the
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
speaker's notice indicated that they
 
02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
needed to be um that the that they
 
02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
needed to be on the agenda uh from
 
02:04:56.149 --> 02:04:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:04.950 --> 02:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
requests what is the committee I will I
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
will take a vote of the committee you
 
02:05:11.069 --> 02:05:11.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:14.549 --> 02:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
them Mr chairman you should probably
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
call them up individually to see what
 
02:05:18.589 --> 02:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
they want to do and why yeah I just
 
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure we could move
 
02:05:22.629 --> 02:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
forward and it seems like the committee
 
02:05:25.669 --> 02:05:25.679 align:start position:0%
is all right with moving forward for
 
02:05:28.990 --> 02:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
accepting the Motions
 
02:05:33.270 --> 02:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh considering not AC
 
02:05:42.549 --> 02:05:42.559 align:start position:0%

the appropriate office and was advised
 
02:05:57.750 --> 02:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
that I was on the agenda and apparently
 
02:05:59.430 --> 02:05:59.440 align:start position:0%

02:06:00.990 --> 02:06:01.000 align:start position:0%

02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
specifically uh I've done lot of lot of
 
02:06:47.189 --> 02:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
work on this is to keep people in their
 
02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
homes and its Elders in their homes uh
 
02:06:53.470 --> 02:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
and the number of ideas and talking with
 
02:06:55.709 --> 02:06:55.719 align:start position:0%
constituents um they came up and wanted
 
02:06:58.430 --> 02:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
to been doing the research on this and
 
02:07:01.830 --> 02:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
have a bill to present to the um to the
 
02:07:05.629 --> 02:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
house uh on um incentivizing folks to
 
02:07:07.310 --> 02:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
stay their homes by having an adjustment
 
02:07:10.149 --> 02:07:10.159 align:start position:0%
on their property tax specific to the
 
02:07:13.870 --> 02:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
school portion of the property tax and
 
02:07:17.149 --> 02:07:17.159 align:start position:0%
what we're finding out uh uh out in the
 
02:07:20.589 --> 02:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
cases to legitimize and hope hopefully
 
02:07:22.870 --> 02:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
support these type of efforts is to have
 
02:07:26.430 --> 02:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
a substantial enough benefit that the um
 
02:07:28.910 --> 02:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
aggressively mature not old as I say but
 
02:07:32.549 --> 02:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
over 65 can stay in their homes by
 
02:07:35.069 --> 02:07:35.079 align:start position:0%
having a um an
 
02:07:38.750 --> 02:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
obligation not credited but uh set aside
 
02:07:42.189 --> 02:07:42.199 align:start position:0%
while they own their home and for uh 25
 
02:07:44.830 --> 02:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
years uh you know 65 plus there's other
 
02:07:48.430 --> 02:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
criteria but not means-based what uh so
 
02:07:50.470 --> 02:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
there's other other issues that that I
 
02:07:52.709 --> 02:07:52.719 align:start position:0%
can answer if you'd like now but wanted
 
02:07:55.030 --> 02:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
that opportunity knowing that we have a
 
02:07:57.910 --> 02:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
a clear housing crisis in affordable not
 
02:08:00.470 --> 02:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
just affordable housing it's access for
 
02:08:02.669 --> 02:08:02.679 align:start position:0%
elderly housing and apartments and town
 
02:08:05.310 --> 02:08:05.320 align:start position:0%
homes as you know there's some some
 
02:08:07.109 --> 02:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
Innovative credit issues going on but
 
02:08:10.149 --> 02:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
it's based on income and uh there many
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh that that will be that's another
 
02:08:14.270 --> 02:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
challenge so I wanted to bring this to
 
02:08:16.109 --> 02:08:16.119 align:start position:0%
the table with timing being of the
 
02:08:20.229 --> 02:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
essence uh but I I I come again with the
 
02:08:22.030 --> 02:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
apology that this I should have been
 
02:08:24.510 --> 02:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
done earlier but that was the reason why
 
02:08:26.629 --> 02:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
and uh that's why I was asking for a
 
02:08:28.910 --> 02:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
consideration in that
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
regard yeah the the the only thing we uh
 
02:08:36.589 --> 02:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
expect is why and you've I believe
 
02:08:39.030 --> 02:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
you've explained why oh I was told i'
 
02:08:40.510 --> 02:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
got to be clear with the with the
 
02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
speaker yeah we don't need to know the
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
content so much as to why you weren't
 
02:08:48.189 --> 02:08:48.199 align:start position:0%
able to uh you know get it in in time oh
 
02:08:52.669 --> 02:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
I apologize for that so so origin Weber
 
02:08:54.950 --> 02:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
I was just going to say Mr Speaker that
 
02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
um we have been very Fierce on this
 
02:09:00.350 --> 02:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
Committee in a bipartisan manner uh
 
02:09:03.270 --> 02:09:03.280 align:start position:0%
about bills that could have been
 
02:09:06.030 --> 02:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
submitted and you know if people could
 
02:09:07.750 --> 02:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
knew or could have known that they
 
02:09:09.910 --> 02:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
really have a duty to get in on time but
 
02:09:12.430 --> 02:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
I will say that the circumstances of
 
02:09:15.149 --> 02:09:15.159 align:start position:0%
this particular case which are apparent
 
02:09:16.709 --> 02:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
who had to
 
02:09:20.510 --> 02:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
be with a critically ill child for an
 
02:09:23.790 --> 02:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
extended period period of time are ones
 
02:09:27.549 --> 02:09:27.559 align:start position:0%
that I simply uh can do nothing except
 
02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
say I would be glad to move that we
 
02:09:32.189 --> 02:09:32.199 align:start position:0%
allow late drafting on this bill without
 
02:09:36.270 --> 02:09:36.280 align:start position:0%
any comment on the bill itself but I I
 
02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:39.599 align:start position:0%
is there a second I'll secondes DEET
 
02:09:39.599 --> 02:09:40.549 align:start position:0%
is there a second I'll secondes DEET
seconds

02:09:40.549 --> 02:09:40.559 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
02:09:44.430 --> 02:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
it um is there any further discussion
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative Smith just a quick
 
02:09:48.830 --> 02:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
question why can't it be a year two
 
02:09:51.790 --> 02:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
Bill why I'm sorry sir well why can't
 
02:09:53.310 --> 02:09:53.320 align:start position:0%
you file it next year why does it have
 
02:09:56.030 --> 02:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
to be a year one bill uh because we have
 
02:09:57.870 --> 02:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
a there a critical impact happening
 
02:10:00.270 --> 02:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
right now where PE where the target
 
02:10:02.069 --> 02:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
market which is our 65 plus are being
 
02:10:04.069 --> 02:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
forced out of their homes and they have
 
02:10:05.629 --> 02:10:05.639 align:start position:0%
no no Alternatives I'm I'm a
 
02:10:07.549 --> 02:10:07.559 align:start position:0%
professional realtor as well and I'm
 
02:10:10.030 --> 02:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
seeing this first firsthand and I would
 
02:10:11.549 --> 02:10:11.559 align:start position:0%
like to bring it to the opportunity for
 
02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
some leadership with Vision on this
 
02:10:16.109 --> 02:10:16.119 align:start position:0%
subject and to have it assess to the
 
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate resol not resolution but the
 
02:10:21.149 --> 02:10:21.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate committee on what we can do
 
02:10:21.159 --> 02:10:22.390 align:start position:0%
appropriate committee on what we can do
uh

02:10:22.390 --> 02:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
now and as
 
02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
immediately but that's
 
02:10:30.069 --> 02:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
it where the
 
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:37.549 --> 02:10:37.559 align:start position:0%
rooll I just wanted to be clear I had
 
02:10:39.229 --> 02:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
representative Weber making the motion
 
02:10:42.589 --> 02:10:42.599 align:start position:0%
and I missed the second representative
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
representa the question is to allow for
 
02:10:46.830 --> 02:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
late drafting for representative command
 
02:10:48.510 --> 02:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
representative Packard yes
 
02:10:50.790 --> 02:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
representative Smith yes representative
 
02:10:53.310 --> 02:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
duet yes representative Osborne yes
 
02:10:55.350 --> 02:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney yes
 
02:10:57.189 --> 02:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
representative Simpson yes
 
02:10:58.950 --> 02:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
representative eel yes representative
 
02:11:01.750 --> 02:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
Weber yes represent Sullivan yes motion
 
02:11:06.790 --> 02:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:14.470 --> 02:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
Horan thank you very much as all of you
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
around the table know I'm represent
 
02:11:20.830 --> 02:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horgan from from uh from Durham
 
02:11:23.149 --> 02:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
and before I begin my testimony I'll
 
02:11:24.350 --> 02:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
just say as a point of personal
 
02:11:26.069 --> 02:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
privilege I actually bought the jacket
 
02:11:28.069 --> 02:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
I'm wearing at Goodwill as was mentioned
 
02:11:32.030 --> 02:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
an hour and a half or so ago but and my
 
02:11:34.270 --> 02:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
bills probably I don't have anything I
 
02:11:36.030 --> 02:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
don't have any personal circumstances
 
02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
that delayed it I just um I sponsored
 
02:11:41.430 --> 02:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
last year HB 1075 a bill that would have
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
abolished daylight savings time putting
 
02:11:45.510 --> 02:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on Standard time yearround and
 
02:11:47.549 --> 02:11:47.559 align:start position:0%
that's uh topic is probably on all of
 
02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
our minds right now because this we're
 
02:11:50.549 --> 02:11:50.559 align:start position:0%
having some of the shortest days of the
 
02:11:52.069 --> 02:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
year so
 
02:11:54.629 --> 02:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
um basically I'm just trying to bring it
 
02:11:56.589 --> 02:11:56.599 align:start position:0%
back now because it's an issue that seem
 
02:11:58.189 --> 02:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
for some reason there seems to be a lot
 
02:12:00.669 --> 02:12:00.679 align:start position:0%
of Nationwide interest in it including a
 
02:12:02.669 --> 02:12:02.679 align:start position:0%
tweet from our president-elect and I I
 
02:12:04.149 --> 02:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
know he tweets lots of things most of
 
02:12:06.750 --> 02:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
which I don't agree with but that idea I
 
02:12:08.870 --> 02:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
actually like so I think the
 
02:12:11.430 --> 02:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
U and also the other thing I'll add is
 
02:12:13.030 --> 02:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
the Bill had a somewhat convoluted
 
02:12:16.270 --> 02:12:16.280 align:start position:0%
legislative history and I was um one of
 
02:12:18.750 --> 02:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
the things I heard a lot was that this
 
02:12:20.830 --> 02:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
might be best done as part of a regional
 
02:12:23.189 --> 02:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
comp which admittedly there is no such
 
02:12:25.310 --> 02:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
Regional compact that exists yet and
 
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
another member actually was planned to
 
02:12:30.430 --> 02:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
introduce a bill with the regional
 
02:12:32.830 --> 02:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
compact in it and he didn't and I didn't
 
02:12:34.350 --> 02:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill that I introduced
 
02:12:36.669 --> 02:12:36.679 align:start position:0%
last year so um that's
 
02:12:39.990 --> 02:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh that's basically why I'm uh why I'm
 
02:12:42.589 --> 02:12:42.599 align:start position:0%
uh asking you to allow me to late draft
 
02:12:44.589 --> 02:12:44.599 align:start position:0%
the bill which would be a fairly simple
 
02:12:46.189 --> 02:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
bill either way the question
 
02:12:47.709 --> 02:12:47.719 align:start position:0%
representative is why didn't you do it
 
02:12:49.510 --> 02:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
during the rig of drafting period oh
 
02:12:50.790 --> 02:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
because I thought another member was
 
02:12:53.229 --> 02:12:53.239 align:start position:0%
bringing a bill that would go better
 
02:12:56.229 --> 02:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
with what we'd heard from the uh um our
 
02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
body and then the other body which I
 
02:12:59.910 --> 02:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
guess were still allowed required to
 
02:13:02.350 --> 02:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
refer to by one on the other side of the
 
02:13:05.790 --> 02:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
wall so it's um I just thought I I
 
02:13:07.589 --> 02:13:07.599 align:start position:0%
didn't know I didn't always he coming at
 
02:13:09.229 --> 02:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
the end of a meeting that's longer than
 
02:13:10.830 --> 02:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
these meetings usually are and I know
 
02:13:13.549 --> 02:13:13.559 align:start position:0%
you all want to go um you want to go
 
02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
home and I see re and Sweeney appears to
 
02:13:18.069 --> 02:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
have a question for me so I will answer
 
02:13:21.629 --> 02:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
ites Sweeny Mr Speaker I move not to
 
02:13:23.669 --> 02:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
allow late drafting
 
02:13:27.910 --> 02:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
okay there a second yes moved in second
 
02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
and not to allow okay thank you is there
 
02:13:33.990 --> 02:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
discussion okay clerical caller roll
 
02:13:38.109 --> 02:13:38.119 align:start position:0%
