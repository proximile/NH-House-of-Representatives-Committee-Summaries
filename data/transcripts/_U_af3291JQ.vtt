00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
um 4.72 3 acres on the easterly side of
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
the p uh parcel after a departmental
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
review it was determined that with
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
Surplus the part the par the parcel will
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
be sold with the following conditions uh
 
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
a survey will be required and uh the
 
00:12:42.189 --> 00:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
survey will prepare a perimeter boundary
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
line plan uh it will also be sold with
 
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
the same restrictions as was put on item
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
031 um due to the archaeological
 
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
sensitivity of the area um again there
 
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
were five realtors
 
00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
that um submitted marketing analysis for
 
00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:06.519 align:start position:0%
this parcel and
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
HKS again based on their analysis based
 
00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
on their location we determined that
 
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
they were probably best to market the
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
property uh they will be given a 6%
 
00:13:19.949 --> 00:13:19.959 align:start position:0%
commission should they be
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
successful again uh the state took a
 
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
look at this parcel
 
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
um and initially thought it was uh
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
appraised a value a a value of
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
114,000 but after looking at HKS
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
analysis we thought we could probably go
 
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
145,000 questions from Mr lante on this
 
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
item yes send
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
L I'm looking at your appraisals so five
 
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
appraisals here and the states is way
 
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
low compared to everybody else uh the
 
00:13:59.310 --> 00:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
closest one is a the next highest bid is
 
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
56,000 by the people you're selecting
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
with the high in a 355 range and yet
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
we're selling for
 
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
145 but there a reason we're so low
 
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
compared to what even the estimates of
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
the commercial Realtors are well again
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
we we we actually went up from our
 
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
initial appraisal um based on again this
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
is reviewed by a licensed certified
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
General appraiser many of the um real
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
estate agencies that put in
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
analysis they're not doing that a a a
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
certifi a CGI is going to go in and
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to do further analysis and
 
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
that's the number they came up with when
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
he reviewed
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
the uh when he reviewed
 
00:14:46.079 --> 00:14:48.430 align:start position:0%
the uh when he reviewed
hk's

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
hk's
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
um hk's marketing
 
00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
analysis he had determined that okay it
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
could come up off uh off 114 but he
 
00:14:59.749 --> 00:14:59.759 align:start position:0%
thought the number was
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
145,000 now we can go up from that uh
 
00:15:06.189 --> 00:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
certainly but um that's what we thought
 
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
a reasonable number that would Fetch and
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
with in light of the fact that
 
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to have to come in if
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
they want to do any type of development
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
they have to coordinate with DHR just
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
sensitivity Senator satisfied with that
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%

unanimously Lon item uh
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
34 please thank you Mr chairman um I'll
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
first point out that there was a hand
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
out given for this item and also for
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
035 uh just to help explain it uh
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
because what we're doing is we're sell
 
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
we're selling a section of the layout of
 
00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
the Conway bypass that's made up of uh I
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
believe it's seven different parcels and
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh we're F we're selling that directly
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
to uh the abutter Shan and Caitlyn
 
00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
Baldwin for 235,000
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
um which they've already paid the uh
 
00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
administrative fee of 1100 when they put
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
in the initial request so what I've done
 
00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:39.079 align:start position:0%
is I've provided that handout because as
 
00:16:40.829 --> 00:16:40.839 align:start position:0%
I went through the
 
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
description of looking at the
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
description of the various Parcels I it
 
00:16:47.949 --> 00:16:47.959 align:start position:0%
was difficult to kind of follow along
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
because this Corridor is made up of bits
 
00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
and pieces of larger Parcels so as you
 
00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
look at it you can see that first we
 
00:16:59.550 --> 00:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
look at parcel 87 and as I looked at
 
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
this description it it is a little
 
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
misleading so in this case this was done
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
in this was this was completed back in
 
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
2006 and what happened was or 2006 and
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
and what happened was the owner at the
 
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:27.079 align:start position:0%
time was interested in another parcel uh
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
a section of of par
 
00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
88 and what was worked out and
 
00:17:38.909 --> 00:17:38.919 align:start position:0%
negotiated was a land slap plus and in
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
this case actually what happened is the
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
state swapped 1.72 Acres that was worth
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
11,000 in return the state credited
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
5,000 which was the value as determined
 
00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
of the section of parcel
 
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
87 that the state was receiving and the
 
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
um owner at the time Mr Charles gave the
 
00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.750 align:start position:0%
um owner at the time Mr Charles gave the
state

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
$6,000 so the two values the value was
 
00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
$11,000 the state
 
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
provided um property and credit and in
 
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
return We also got
 
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
$6,000 um parcel 88 as you see basically
 
00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.270 align:start position:0%
$6,000 um parcel 88 as you see basically
it

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
it is um a smaller section consists
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
inside the corridor that's now part of
 
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
the subject property and the remaining
 
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
section was purchased by the state and
 
00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
then previously conveyed to
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
um I believe Mr Baldwin or his
 
00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
predecessor and interest and that's the
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
same for 89 90 as you look up at
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
91 um the the sale
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
kind of shoots out because there were
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
these um uneconomic remnants that the
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
state had to buy because basically it
 
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
was it was um bisecting them from the
 
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
larger parcel and then you have parcel
 
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
92 and parcel 94 that makes up the
 
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
um that makes up the subject parcel that
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
is being
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
conveyed uh again the conditions of the
 
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
sale will require the uh grantee to
 
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
commission a licens land surveyor to do
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
a boundary line uh survey uh buyers
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for obtaining all state and
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
local approvals and um the property also
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
will be conveyed to uh conveyed subject
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
to a trail easement that will be uh held
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
by uh
 
00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
dncr so uh we uh staff appraiser took a
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
look at that took a look at the property
 
00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:05.919 align:start position:0%
and determined that it had a value of
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
lonte motion um made by Lang second by
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
Mills to approve item
 
00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:22.039 align:start position:0%
034 if you're in favor of that motion
 
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
you signify by saying I I I if you
 
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
oppose nay motion carries unanimously
 
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
uh before you move to the next item sir
 
00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.270 align:start position:0%
uh before you move to the next item sir
item

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
item
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
35 um a qu I don't believe you have any
 
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
answer to this but I'm just going to ask
 
00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:42.919 align:start position:0%
U Chris if you could ask the department
 
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
so we're we're getting to a point that
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
we're able to sell off many of these
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
Parcels from the Conway
 
00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
bypass um is anyone keeping a running T
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
of how when these Parcels are sold and
 
00:20:59.149 --> 00:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
what the balance is and
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
um because I if I remember it's going to
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
be a tremendous drain on on our state
 
00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
paying this back the answer to that is

was owed back to the federal government

parcel 84 I just point out that it's
 
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.600 align:start position:0%

motion

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:15.480 align:start position:0%

carries um I will recognize
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
R question uh thank you Mr chairman it's
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
a general question you've gone through a
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
lot of these and we've gone through them
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
in the past when you say uh regist land
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
surveyor is going to provide a a plot or
 
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
whatever do they also set in the corners
 
00:24:34.909 --> 00:24:34.919 align:start position:0%
they also doing putting a is it part of
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
the uh requirement to to put the
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
boundary markers in so that that'll
 
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
depend on the sale um we we will do that
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
if there is a need for it um and that's
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
usually a determination that's made by
 
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
our uh chief of mapping and Survey if he
 
00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:54.440 align:start position:0%
he sees there's value like we just sold
 
00:24:57.389 --> 00:24:57.399 align:start position:0%
a piece in entrum and markers were put
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
in to establish
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
the uh conservation easement that was
 
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
that property was being sold under uh we
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
earlier this year we sold a property up
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
in Conway that had a rail Corridor going
 
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
through it markers were put on either
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
corner to to establish where that rail
 
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
Corridor was so it all depends but if
 
00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
it's a larger parcel out in the middle
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
it it may not require we may not make
 
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
that as a condition further question uh
 
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
um sometimes it's really confusing of
 
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
what who owns what out there especially
 
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
when you're switching stuff around like
 
00:25:37.389 --> 00:25:37.399 align:start position:0%
this I think it really ought to be
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
considered to be putting these in so
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
there's no question in the future that's
 
00:25:43.149 --> 00:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
just a comment okay thank you thank we
 
00:25:43.159 --> 00:25:44.750 align:start position:0%
just a comment okay thank you thank we
look

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
at seeing no further question we will
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%

transfer ownership of weeks Crossing Dam

town of
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
Warren the backstory on this is uh July
 
00:26:41.549 --> 00:26:41.559 align:start position:0%
1st of 2017 week's Crossing Dam failed
 
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:43.240 align:start position:0%
during a flooding event resulting from a
 
00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
significant thunderstorm in the baker
 
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
River Valley this failure caused gou
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
Hill Road which is located immediately
 
00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
Downstream of the dam to be over topped
 
00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.190 align:start position:0%
Downstream of the dam to be over topped
and

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
failed because of the significant value
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
that week's Crossing Pond provided to
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
the community the town of waren
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
in the form of recreation but also more
 
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
importantly in the form of fire
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
suppression the town seek assistance to
 
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
try to rebuild the dam through fishing
 
00:27:08.909 --> 00:27:08.919 align:start position:0%
game who was at the time the owner of
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
that structure ultimately it was agreed
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
upon by the town Dees and fishing game
 
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
because Dees is responsible for the uh
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
repair and operation of Maintenance of
 
00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
fishing game owned structures that the
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
state would rebuild the dam and the town
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
would take over ownership once the dam
 
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.269 align:start position:0%
would take over ownership once the dam
was

00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
rebuilt so NH s worked with uh FEMA at
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
the time and was able to secure 75%
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
funding for that reconstruction and so
 
00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
nhds undertook the Reconstruction using
 
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
Force account labor that reconstruction
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
of weeks Crossing dam was completed in
 
00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:45.039 align:start position:0%
2021 after securing the necessary
 
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
easements through fish from fishing game
 
00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:48.919 align:start position:0%
along with a adjacent Property Owners
 
00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:50.799 align:start position:0%
the footprint of the dam had to be
 
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
offset a little bit moved upst stream
 
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
from where it was located prior because
 
00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:56.120 align:start position:0%
of the location of goldhill
 
00:27:59.630 --> 00:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
Road and during the Warren town meeting
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
in March of 2023 the town voted to take
 
00:28:03.149 --> 00:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
over ownership and maintenance of the
 
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
dam and so nhcs has been working since
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
that time with FEMA to make sure that
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
they have all the requirements that they
 
00:28:12.269 --> 00:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
need to secure the funding reimbursement
 
00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:14.519 align:start position:0%
and we are pretty close to finalizing
 
00:28:16.269 --> 00:28:16.279 align:start position:0%
that documentation to transfer the
 
00:28:19.149 --> 00:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
funding from that reconstruction to
 
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
nhcs so the transfer of this Dam will be
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
one small step in reducing the number of
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
dams that the state of New Hampshire
 
00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
currently owns Which is a goal of HDs as
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
the risk associated with Dam ownership

depending on your source of

invest uh approximately $1.6 million in
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%

it as an office building as a State
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
Office Building uh until earlier this
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
year um the department identified it
 
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
some time ago as a building that had uh
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
increasing maintenance costs uh regular
 
00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:11.720 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs time and time again um
 
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
a few years ago the decision was made
 
00:31:15.149 --> 00:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
the termination was made that we would
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
like to uh dispose of it uh due to the
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
mounting costs of of continuing to own
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
it um and then we proceeded to wait
 
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
until this year uh when the Last Tenant
 
00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
agency uh DHHS uh finally vacated uh so
 
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
now the building is vacant and um when
 
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
we began the disposal process we had we
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
received interest from the New Hampshire
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
