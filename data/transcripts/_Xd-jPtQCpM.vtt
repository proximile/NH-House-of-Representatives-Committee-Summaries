note

00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.879 --> 00:34:16.149 align:start position:0%

00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
where was the fiscal note that wasn't so
 
00:34:27.599 --> 00:34:28.710 align:start position:0%
where was the fiscal note that wasn't so
pretty

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:38.869 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.879 --> 00:34:39.829 align:start position:0%
 
there

00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
there was also an amended fiscal note
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
for 4 18
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
the one that sort of didn't look like
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
well we didn't get the the only thing
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
that looks like a fiscal an amended
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that we've gotten from them
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
is 427 so the committee got
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
what you sent out because you had
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%

2022-13-53-h

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%

thank you would you like to speak to
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
your motion representative teresa sure
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
what the amendment does
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
is it just strikes in lines 13 14 of the
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
original bill it strikes out the word
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
for the handling of marked ballots and
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
it strikes that part out so then it
 
00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.069 align:start position:0%
it strikes that part out so then it
reads

00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
reads
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
the in the bold uh lettering other than
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
a position of an election official shall
 
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
not be allowed to remain in the area
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
designated for the counting of votes
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's how then it now reads if we adopt
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
all right questions or discussion on the
 
00:37:51.119 --> 00:37:52.390 align:start position:0%
all right questions or discussion on the
amendment

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
i can't support the amendment uh for all
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
the reasons that we found house bill
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
1359 in expedient to legislate
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
the constitution
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
dictates orders
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
mandates whatever words you want to use
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
under part 2 article 32 that the
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
moderator shall govern the election at
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
town meetings and of course
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
elections where ballots are cast
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
and we can't pass a state law that
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
takes away the authority given to our
 
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
moderators by the state constitution and
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what the bill does and
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment still does it too
 
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:37.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the moderator from from
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
ballots are being counted or handled i
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
had asked senator gray specifically if
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
an area could be cordoned off
 
00:38:49.839 --> 00:38:50.710 align:start position:0%
an area could be cordoned off
where

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
inside the
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
voting area if an area could be cordoned
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
off where someone could be assigned to
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
be processing absentee ballots because
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
that's something that can be happening
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
throughout the day and usually does
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
especially in a big election
 
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
but senator gray's response was no it he
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
really should be out of the building
 
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
entirely not just away from that area
 
00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.349 align:start position:0%
entirely not just away from that area
so

00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
again i'm going to oppose it because
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
we're denying the moderator the
 
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to fulfill the
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
responsibilities he or she has under the
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
um i'm just going to say i'm going to
 
00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
i am not
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent sure that the change
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
addresses the issue
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
i think the issue that's being raised by
 
00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
the election official on
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
a ballot as a candidate for office is
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
their actual presence
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
that their presence can affect
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
someone's decision to vote for
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
or against someone
 
00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:56.390 align:start position:0%
or against someone
in

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
the polling place
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
that i've heard anybody say that they
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
are concerned about the conduct
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
itself of an official who's on the
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
ballot however this is an issue that
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
comes before this committee
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
session after session after session
 
00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.510 align:start position:0%
session after session after session
and

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
i think that by restricting it
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
to the area designated for the counting
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
of votes
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
we allow
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
the moderator constitutionally
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
assigned to the duties of oversight to
 
00:40:35.119 --> 00:40:36.829 align:start position:0%
assigned to the duties of oversight to
still

00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
conduct oversight duties
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
i also think it is possible to cordon
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
off the designated area for counting of
 
00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.870 align:start position:0%
off the designated area for counting of
votes

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
votes
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
much easier than it is to do
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
what the original bill proposed which
 
00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.430 align:start position:0%
what the original bill proposed which
included

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.190 align:start position:0%
included
um

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
the handling of march ballots because
 
00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.349 align:start position:0%
the handling of march ballots because
arguably

00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
arguably
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
walking from the voting booth
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
ballot box is a place where there are
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
marked ballots so arguably that would
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
prevent somebody from walking through
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
that area
 
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
and that seemed
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
not effectively effectuating the purpose
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
of the bill or practical so
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
i can't say i disagree with anything
 
00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:26.079 align:start position:0%
anybody said but
 
00:41:26.079 --> 00:41:27.430 align:start position:0%
anybody said but
maybe

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
if we pass this we won't have a bill on
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
it next year
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
and we'll see how it works
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
representative teresa thank you madam
 
00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.270 align:start position:0%
representative teresa thank you madam
chair

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
i i do agree with what you said and
 
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.190 align:start position:0%
i i do agree with what you said and
again

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
we know it's not perfect um but the
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
reason for striking out that verbiage
 
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
was to
 
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839 align:start position:0%
it basically basically it's a out for
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
the handling of the mocked ballots the
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
they can still do that the moderator
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
even if they're on the ballot so it's
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
kind of a compromise it it gets us part
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
way there so for that reason i'm
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
supporting it but but i concur it's not
 
00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:04.150 align:start position:0%
supporting it but but i concur it's not
perfect

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
of course all the other bills we do here
 
00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
in this committee are perfect so there
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
you go all right any other discussion on
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
this amendment the motion on the floor
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
is to amend the bill
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
seeing no further discussion i'm going
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
to ask the clerk to call the role on
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
i am asking for committee reports today
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
to the extent we can get bills in the
 
00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.870 align:start position:0%
to the extent we can get bills in the
calendar

00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
for next week
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
it means the committee will have less to
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
do in the last session so we're going to
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
try to get in what we can though
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
admittedly everybody's going to be
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
concentrating on the early bills for the
 
00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:41.839 align:start position:0%
calendar for next session
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
um i also want to say i feel a little
 
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
bit like the disjointed first grade
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
teacher where everybody has sat in the
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
wrong seats i am completely confused by
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
both sides of the room today
 
00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.230 align:start position:0%
both sides of the room today
with

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative lane sitting at the wrong
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
table completely
 
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
and i have four individuals at this
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
table over here so if the chair is
 
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
looking around the room
 
00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
like she's lost something it's because
 
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
she can't keep track of where anybody is
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
today all right sb 328
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
is a bill that was carried over from
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
last week
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
um this is a bill relative to the state
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
primary this proposes to change the
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%

sweeney thank you madam chair i very
 
00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
begrudgingly uh moved to find this an
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate i
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh eight years ago i sponsored a bill to
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
move the primary to june uh that got
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
absolutely nowhere i think it died on
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
the house floor in a voice vote
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
last year i sponsored the same
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
legislation along with some others uh we
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
passed it in the house uh went over to
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
the senate it was amended in the senate
 
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
to august
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
we committee a conference it i
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
begrudgingly agreed in the committee
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
conference as did others to just try to
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
get something passed uh with the august
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
deadline for the senate was not budging
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
and then that bill to move the primary
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
to august got vetoed by the governor
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
and i was really hopeful this year when
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
i saw that the senate put forward a bill
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
to move the primary to june that we
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
would finally be able to get it
 
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
a june primary bill to the governor's
 
00:47:37.829 --> 00:47:37.839 align:start position:0%
desk not speculating what that outcome
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
would have been but i was hopeful we
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
would have been able to do that
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately it seems like we're in
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
the same place as we were last year with
 
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
an august bill
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
but i don't believe we're going to be
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
make work this year to pass a june bill
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
um so i i i believe the supporters of a
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
june primary uh should not see this uh
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
more more or less as a setback uh
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully next year we can bring forward
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
a june primary uh that can go the
 
00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.470 align:start position:0%
a june primary uh that can go the
distance

00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
distance
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately uh today we're gonna
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'll vote to make this an expedient to
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:17.839 align:start position:0%
chair uh i would support the motion to
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
find this billing expedient to legislate
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
for the reasons really that the governor
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned in his
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
veto message for a similar bill last
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
year where he said it could result in
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
depressed voter engagement in the
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
election reduced turnout
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
could hurt the ability of municipalities
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
to recruit poll work as an election day
 
00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.630 align:start position:0%
to recruit poll work as an election day
volunteers

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
volunteers
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
and i would just add that one of my
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
election officials in nashua just told
 
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
me this week that he didn't believe all
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
the gymnasiums where we hold our polling
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
polling locations are necessarily
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
air-conditioned which means an august
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
state is not too
 
00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
too attractive to them so with that i
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
will be supporting the uh
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
motion to find this bill in expedient to
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
legislate representative barry uh yes
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
i'm a big fan of june i'm not a big fan
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
of august but i do want to read into
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
not to belabor this point but i do want
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
to read a quote
 
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hosts the second latest
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
primary in the nation september 13th
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
giving the eventual republican nominee
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
little time and few resources to
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
communicate after emerging from what is
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
said to be an extreme and chaotic
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
primary that is the words of senator
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
maggie hassan's campaign manager so i
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
will create a new quote for all of my
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
friends on the other side of the aisle

some time and move on

um just so people are aware of what 1383
 
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
does 1383 deals with the bill this
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
committee has is a bill this committee
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
has previously passed in regards to
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
the conduct of election on a local level
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
it is an appropriate topic and
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
consistent with the bill that senator
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
guida has brought forward
 
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
and it is my hope that
 
00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
the senate will come to grips with doing
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
something with this issue if it's
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
presented in the same bill so anybody
 
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
else representative bergeron did you
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
want to speak um
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
i i think the chair summarized it quite
 
00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
well this is a bill that passed the
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
committee although the minority
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
didn't uh
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
support it in its original form i'm
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
referring to the amendment
 
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
it was a very minor objection and i
 
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
think this
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
bill is improved with the amendment
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
that's been proposed and therefore i
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
will be supporting the amendment and
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
then the bill is ought to pass as
 
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.390 align:start position:0%
then the bill is ought to pass as
amended

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%

consent calendar
 
00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
and that concludes our consideration of
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
the bills that had originally been
 
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
thought to go forward last week
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
so we are now back to the bills that
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
have been noticed in the calendar for
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
this week um the first one numerically
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
is 348 relative to political
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
expenditures and contributions
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
um this bill was the one that presented
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
uh what
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
is alleged by some to be the limits in
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
statute in chart form
 
00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%

00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
 
00:57:38.829 --> 00:57:38.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
chair the language in the bill is
 
00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
h bill
 
00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
house bill 348 limits the contributions
 
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
an individual can make to a political
 
00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:53.589 align:start position:0%
an individual can make to a political
party

00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
but removes any limit on what an
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
individual can contribute to a political
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization
 
00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:00.799 align:start position:0%
it also removes any limit on what a
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
political advocacy organization can make
 
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
to a political party
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a roundabout way of
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
removing any limit on what an individual
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
can contribute to a political party
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
there's also the issue that was raised
 
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
when this table was inserted into the
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
statute the heading of the section
 
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
talks about prohibited contributions yet
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
in the table there are some
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
contributions that are described as
 
00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:25.430 align:start position:0%
contributions that are described as
unlimited

00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
unlimited
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
so you can't really prohibit any amount
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
over the word unlimited
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
as being ineligible for being
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
contributed to a campaign
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
with that said even though i think it's
 
00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
the bill had a lot of support in the
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
senate bipartisan support came out of
 
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
committee on a five to zero vote
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
senator susie proposed a four amendment
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
which passed
 
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
and then the bill passed by a voice vote
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
it appears that the bill
 
00:58:58.079 --> 00:59:00.069 align:start position:0%
it appears that the bill
offers

00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
offers
 
00:59:00.079 --> 00:59:01.829 align:start position:0%
offers
more

00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
that is that is good than what is bad
 
00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:07.839 align:start position:0%
and so i'm gonna look the other way in
 
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
terms of the sloppy drafting of the uh
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
and i will vote to support uh senate
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
bill 348.
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
further discussion on 348 representative
 
00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
terosian thank you madam chair
 
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
when it when this first came before us
 
00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
first i was like i don't really see why
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
we need this but then
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
looking through
 
00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
the statue and the way
 
00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
how difficult was to dredge out the
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
information i
 
00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:35.750 align:start position:0%
information i
i

00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
to agree it's not perfect what what bill
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
is but having that
 
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:42.799 align:start position:0%
table the gray table even though it's
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
not gray
 
00:59:43.839 --> 00:59:45.349 align:start position:0%
not gray
um

00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
in i think we should name it the gray
 
00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:49.030 align:start position:0%
in i think we should name it the gray
table

00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
table
 
00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:50.390 align:start position:0%
table
okay

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
we'll have to have an amendment but in
 
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
any way it makes it very clear what the
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
limits are on on the various uh
 
00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:58.309 align:start position:0%
limits are on on the various uh
categories

00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
categories
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't the bill doesn't change
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
any of those numbers it just makes it
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
clear what they are
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
for that reason i'll vote yes
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
i i agree with representative bergeron
 
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
and i think it was actually um
 
01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
zinc from open democracy who brought up
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
the double negative so i pulled out
 
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
afterwards and i just did again the
 
01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:24.559 align:start position:0%
statute and i think this goes to one of
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
the things i've been saying for a little
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
while is that our election laws need to
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
be rewritten because the reality is the
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
way political contributions are in the
 
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
statute is as a negative
 
01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.109 align:start position:0%
statute is as a negative
so

01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
it makes it
 
01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.349 align:start position:0%
it makes it
um

01:00:37.349 --> 01:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
awkward i think in the in the reading
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
though not
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
discernible as to what its intent is
 
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'm going to ask the clerk
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
to call the roll the motion on the floor
 
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
is otp
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.799 --> 01:01:20.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
the vote on sb 348 is otp 20-0 without
 
01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.270 align:start position:0%
the vote on sb 348 is otp 20-0 without
objection

01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
objection
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
that will go on consent calendar
 
01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
the next bill that this committee has
 
01:01:55.109 --> 01:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
before it is sb 365 relative to absentee

i would madam chairman thank you

um there's a number of concerns uh
 
01:02:31.109 --> 01:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
regarding this proposed legislation uh
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
we heard extensive testimony the other
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
day when we had the hearing
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
concerns about people with visual
 
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
challenges visual impairment being able
 
01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.349 align:start position:0%
challenges visual impairment being able
to

01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
make sure that their vote was going to
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
be counted
 
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
because of the concern about the
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
affidavit being properly included
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
so there's some issues that way there's
 
01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:52.069 align:start position:0%
so there's some issues that way there's
been

01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
legal issues in the past between the
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
state and visually challenged people
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
there's also security issues with any
 
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
kind of pre-processing which is what
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
this is really about
 
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
so uh for those reasons madam chairman i
 
01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
i'm moving expedient to legislate
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on the motion
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
chair i'll be opposing um
 
01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
the motion to find this bill and
 
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
yes it is uh
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
partial pre-processing of absentee
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
ballots but what that really entails
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
is allowing the clerk to remove the
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
affidavit envelope
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
from the mail-in envelope
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
attach the absentee ballot request form
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
to that affidavit envelope and under
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
use the right term i guess
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
the uh accessible voting program
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
affidavit to the affidavit envelope as
 
01:03:49.839 --> 01:03:51.670 align:start position:0%
affidavit to the affidavit envelope as
well

01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
we're not asking the clerks or any other
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
election officials to have additional
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
interaction with voters if they realize
 
01:03:59.589 --> 01:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with it
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
people that are voting
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
in office can just hand the affidavit
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
envelope over the counter to the clerk
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
not stick it in another envelope it's
 
01:04:09.029 --> 01:04:09.039 align:start position:0%
not a big cost savings but you're not
 
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
going to be using as many outer
 
01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.670 align:start position:0%
going to be using as many outer
envelopes

01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
envelopes
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
i i think in a large election this will
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
be tremendous help to the election
 
01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
officials at the polls because it will
 
01:04:20.069 --> 01:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
save them time slitting envelopes and
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
removing the affidavit envelopes from
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
the ballot so i will be supporting uh
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
senate bill 365 is ought to pass but
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
since the motion is itl i will be
 
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
opposing that first
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion on the
 
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'm going to ask the clerk
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
to call the role
 
01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.470 align:start position:0%
to call the role

01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
i had a concern
 
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
as a result of the testimony on this
 
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
bill during the public hearing
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
that the secretary of state's office
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
might only pull one
 
01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:49.589 align:start position:0%
might only pull one
accuvote

01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
accuvote
 
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
voting device out of a polling place
 
01:06:54.789 --> 01:06:54.799 align:start position:0%
even if two were used and the testimony
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
indicated that the election officials
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
would be instructed to make sure
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
the ballots that went through each
 
01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
accuvope machine were separated and not
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
combined into a single boxes or a group
 
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
and let me share a story a story with
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
you where my concern comes from number
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
of years ago during a presidential
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
election in nashua i was concerned that
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
we didn't have enough um
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
ballots coming from the secretary of
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
state so
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
as allowed under the law at the time we
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
had our print shop prepare 500 ballots
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
for each of the nine wards
 
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
and those were boxed separately they
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't be scanned of course because
 
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
they were printed on heavier stock but
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
other than adding my signature to them
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
they uh
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
they looked exactly like
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
the official ballots and on those boxes
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
i put in an eight and a half by eleven
 
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
paper uh do not open this box use last
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
these ballots will not scan
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
we talked about it in training
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
and darn it five minutes after the polls
 
01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
open up i had a call from one of the
 
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
moderators saying our ballots aren't
 
01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.670 align:start position:0%
moderators saying our ballots aren't
scanning

01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
scanning
 
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
so i asked him to go back and look at
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
the box that he opened up to use and he
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
came back all apologetic i'm sorry i
 
01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
opened up the one i wasn't supposed to
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
so we might have the best of intentions
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
of telling our election officials not to
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
mix the ballots that went through the
 
01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
tabulator and machine x with the cartons
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
that are supposed to hold the ballast
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
machine y
 
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
but that's there's no guarantee that's
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
going to happen we should minimize the
 
01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
possibility of human error at the
 
01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
polling places
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
i think we would have a much more
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
difficult problem if that occurs and
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
then the ballots are taken back for an
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
audit at the secretary of state's office
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
and we suddenly find that the high speed
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
scanner has different numbers than the
 
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
accu vote machine had on election night
 
01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:49.990 align:start position:0%
accu vote machine had on election night
so

01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
my amendment simply says if more than
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
one machine is used in a polling place
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
all the machines using the polling place
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
should be part of the audit and that's
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
the purpose for the amendment
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
representative sweeney
 
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i just wanted to
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%

01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
amendment to it and look forward to
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
supporting it thank you representative
 
01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
barry that's exactly what i was going to
 
01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
say it was a good faith effort and thank
 
01:09:13.759 --> 01:09:16.630 align:start position:0%
say it was a good faith effort and thank
you

01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
all right any further discussion on the
 
01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:21.749 align:start position:0%
all right any further discussion on the
amendment

01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
i frankly didn't want to get into the
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
fact that you picked the wrong machine
 
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
to audit and the other one needed to be
 
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.590 align:start position:0%
to audit and the other one needed to be
audited

01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
audited
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
that was my concern
 
01:09:32.799 --> 01:09:33.590 align:start position:0%
that was my concern
so

01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any further discussion on
 
01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
it the motion on the floor is to amend

speak to your motion yes ma'am chairman
 
01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna let my comments to just the
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
amendment because i imagine we'll have
 
01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
lengthy discussion on the underlying
 
01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.709 align:start position:0%
lengthy discussion on the underlying
bill

01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
what i did was i took in many of the
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
considerations that was brought forward
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
in the testimony to try to make the bill
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
more appealing
 
01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
i'm not delusional to think that this
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
will change the outcome of the
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
underlying vote should this um pass
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
through the movement past but i do think
 
01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
that there were some legitimate concerns
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
that were brought up that need to be
 
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
addressing so i'll kind of go through
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
them um
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
there's three main points in this um the
 
01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
first of which is a move the enactment
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
date to january 1st of 2023 we shouldn't
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
be making major election law changes in
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
a general election year um it's just
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
foolish um second thing is i'm sure that
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
there will be a lawsuit not because i
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
think there's anything legally wrong
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
with this but because anyone can file a
 
01:13:59.830 --> 01:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
lawsuit and get an injunction going
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
so this will give time for any lawsuit
 
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
to work its way through
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
before we're trying to implement it so
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
that was a good faith effort to not do
 
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
anything in an election year
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
the first major change is in section one
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
i removed the requirement for anybody
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
who's already on the rolls that shows up
 
01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
without an id um
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
as is common knowledge now you don't
 
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
actually need an id to vote in new to
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
when you're voting in new hampshire they
 
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
ask you for your id you don't actually
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
have to show it i'm not going to change
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
that the reason being is that we cut off
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
registration 14 days before an election
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
it's a job of the supervisor checklist
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure the people that are on the
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
checklist actually live where they say
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
they live so i'm going to let them do
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
their job
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
so this scopes this bill down to just
 
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
people that are showing up on election
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
day with nothing um so now we are only
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
talking about people who are showing up
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
to the polling location on election day
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
with nothing um so i think that is that
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
is that is the problem
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
um the other the other main excuse me
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
the allergies are getting me um
 
01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
the other thing i did was i changed down
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
the i changed it to a seventh day after
 
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
the election instead of ten that wasn't
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
to make it harder um it's just to try to
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
accommodate some of the iokava concerns
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
that were brought up but no one's trying
 
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
to disenfranchise military voters here
 
01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's ridiculous um let's be
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
real i'm the son of a vietnam veteran my
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
brother's a veteran no one's trying to
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise veteran voters here
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
active duty military voters here it's
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
it's ludicrous um so we are going to try
 
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
to address that somewhat
 
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
um and bring that down so that our
 
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
military people overseas can get their
 
01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
ballots on time in compliance with you
 
01:15:33.199 --> 01:15:34.149 align:start position:0%
ballots on time in compliance with you
acaba

01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
acaba
 
01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
once again it's a good faith effort um
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
still doesn't make the bill perfect um
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
there's still some things i would see
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
like to be changed but it'll send it too
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
many conference and i'm sure the senate
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
will opine on this and we'll we'll have
 
01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
something else that will come forward um
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
but you know i think it does make it um
 
01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
it is undoubtable to my friends on the
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
other side of how this makes it better
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
i know that you probably still won't
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
support it but it was a good faith
 
01:15:55.679 --> 01:15:57.510 align:start position:0%
support it but it was a good faith
effort

01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
effort
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you further comments on the
 
01:16:01.630 --> 01:16:01.640 align:start position:0%
amendment that's on the floor which is
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
1487 representative bergeron thank you
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
well i appreciate the movement to
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
shorten the amount of time
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of accommodating you
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay for voters
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh i would remind members of this
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
committee that last year
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
we had a bill before us
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
every sixth or seventh year the state
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
primary election to the first tuesday in
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
september and the secretary of state
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
testified at that
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
point uh during the testimony that the
 
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
reason for doing so is at the end of the
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
recount uh there were only a few days
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
where the secretary of state's office
 
01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:43.270 align:start position:0%
where the secretary of state's office
could

01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
manage to get the ballots printed to
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
meet the 45-day requirement under yuo
 
01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:48.390 align:start position:0%
meet the 45-day requirement under yuo
kava

01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
kava
 
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
so while this might make it a little
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
easier in most years
 
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
to meet the requirement to get these
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
affidavit ballots pulled and sent to the
 
01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
secretary of state there will still be
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
some years
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
where there won't be enough time to get
 
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
the general election ballots out 45 days
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
before the election so for that reason
 
01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
i'll be uh opposing the amendment as
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative barry just i want to
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
point out that all this could be avoided
 
01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
if we had a primary in june i i sort of
 
01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
had a thought that that might be what
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
you said but i reckon there you go any
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:30.470 align:start position:0%

01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
it certainly
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
addresses some of the concerns that some
 
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
people had
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
in regard to
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
the military vote nukava
 
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh the secretary of state himself and
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
testimony had had brought that up that a
 
01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
seven-day would would address that for
 
01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
those that don't know i'm a united
 
01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
states coast guard veteran
 
01:19:54.159 --> 01:19:55.590 align:start position:0%
states coast guard veteran
and

01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
i take
 
01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:58.390 align:start position:0%
i take
the

01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
ability to ensure in
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
the mechanism to ensure that our
 
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
military wherever they may be in the
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
world can exercise their right
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
quite frankly if it wasn't for our
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
military uh through some major conflicts
 
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
we we probably still wouldn't have the
 
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
right so i very much um appreciate what
 
01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
they do for us and certainly would not
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
never vote against something that would
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
the by amending the bill
 
01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:31.750 align:start position:0%
the by amending the bill
we

01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
get a chance to digest
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
how this is going to work with local
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
elections prior to a statewide election
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
to work out any
 
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
items that may be some unforeseen
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
but in regard to what you heard will
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
there be a lawsuit
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
sure we we love to have lawsuits um i
 
01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
would point out this this
 
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:20:56.709 --> 01:20:56.719 align:start position:0%
senate bill 3.
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:00.639 align:start position:0%
different than senate bill 3. i
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not an attorney but i believe it
 
01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:04.719 align:start position:0%
would pass muster um we had a
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative who was a co-sponsor of
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
was in that position of being a judge
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
and he believes with his knowledge and
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
having sat on the bench and heard
 
01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.030 align:start position:0%
having sat on the bench and heard
um

01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
various uh legislative um
 
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
items that
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
he believes
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
in his opinion it would pass monster we
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
don't know until it if and when it goes
 
01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
there but by changing the
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
date that gives time for any that come
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
forward to be worked through
 
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
regard to
 
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
showing an id
 
01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:38.790 align:start position:0%
showing an id
let's

01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
let's
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
let's be honest in 2022
 
01:21:44.229 --> 01:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
what can't you do without um having an
 
01:21:46.149 --> 01:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
id you can't buy alcohol you can't cash
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
your check
 
01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
i think in some times you can't even
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
register your dog
 
01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
um you can't register your boat
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
and on and on you can't get on an
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
airplane you can't um you go to a hotel
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
you have to show an id
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony that somebody was
 
01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
picking up their child from daycare and
 
01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
forgot to bring
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
their license with them most daycares
 
01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
you have to show an id to pick up your
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
child so
 
01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:12.709 align:start position:0%
child so
anyway

01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:22:12.719 --> 01:22:14.229 align:start position:0%
anyway
today

01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
we live in a time when
 
01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
you need an id to function
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
in society with whatever you do
 
01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.310 align:start position:0%
in society with whatever you do
so

01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
for all those reasons i
 
01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
will be voting
 
01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
yes to otter passes amended for senate
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion 418 is on the floor
 
01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
it's amended representative bergeron
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how to summarize two hours
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
of testimony in a few minutes
 
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.189 align:start position:0%
of testimony in a few minutes
um

01:22:45.189 --> 01:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
and i and i know everybody was very
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
attentive to the speakers that we heard
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
last week on this bill but i do want to
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
highlight a few few points that were
 
01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:54.790 align:start position:0%
highlight a few few points that were
made

01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
again let me start with the problem
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
about getting those ballots ready 45
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
days prior to the general election
 
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's still a concern
 
01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
the amendment that was passed might have
 
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
helped a little bit for
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh most of a seven year cycle but
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
certainly not all
 
01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.629 align:start position:0%
certainly not all
um

01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:15.669 --> 01:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
cordell johnson and by mail and others
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
in person pointed out that there's
 
01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
already a statute that says no mark of
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
any nature shall be placed on any ballot
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
by an election officer and yet here we
 
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
are telling them to identify uh
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
so-called affidavit ballots which by the
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
way the secretary of state called
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
provisional ballots
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
identify them and and keep them separate
 
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
i raised the the point uh
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
about our constitution the recent
 
01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
amendment says that an individual's
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
right to live free from government
 
01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
intrusion in private or personal
 
01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
information is natural essential and
 
01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:50.229 align:start position:0%
information is natural essential and
inherent

01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
inherent
 
01:23:50.239 --> 01:23:51.189 align:start position:0%
inherent
this

01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
affidavit so-called affidavit ballot
 
01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:54.470 align:start position:0%
affidavit so-called affidavit ballot
process

01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
violates the principle of the secret
 
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
ballot uh the moderator is identifying
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
voters putting uh a matching number so
 
01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
that that ballot can be matched up with
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
the voter later and uh that voter's
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
ballot may under certain circumstances
 
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
be disallowed
 
01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:13.510 align:start position:0%
be disallowed
uh

01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know where else to go from there
 
01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:20.790 align:start position:0%
i don't know where else to go from there
um

01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
let me let me stop there i i think it
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
i i did raise the point of a court case
 
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
that occurred in kansas
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
where uh the 10th circuit court had
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
indicated that
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
requiring documentary documentary proof
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
of citizenship from certain voters was a
 
01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
violation of the 14th amendment under
 
01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:41.990 align:start position:0%
violation of the 14th amendment under
the

01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
equal protection clause i think we have
 
01:24:46.709 --> 01:24:46.719 align:start position:0%
state and federal issues here
 
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
to be concerned about uh
 
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
and given that the state spent four
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
million dollars on litigating senate
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
bill three i don't think we should be
 
01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
too casual about
 
01:24:59.189 --> 01:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
just simply saying well this will
 
01:25:01.110 --> 01:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
probably end up in court because we're
 
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
spending taxpayers dollars when it's
 
01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:04.310 align:start position:0%
spending taxpayers dollars when it's
unnecessary

01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
i will be opposing senate bill 418 as
 
01:25:09.189 --> 01:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
amended thank you
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sweeney thank
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%

01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
the amendment that has now replaced the
 
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
the section of the bill
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
for all elections if a voter on election
 
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
day is registering to vote for the first
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
time in new hampshire and does not have
 
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
a valid photo identification
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
establishing such voters identification
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
or does not meet the identity
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
requirements of rsa 659-13 then such
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
voters shall vote by affidavit ballot
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
pursuant to this section those are the
 
01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
only voters under this bill as we've
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
amended that will be voting by affidavit
 
01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
ballot in new hampshire the goal of new
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire should be that nobody
 
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
votes by affidavit ballot
 
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
everyone should be able and and the
 
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge should be out there that they
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
are compliant with the law of voting
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
before they get to the ballot box
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
this is a a
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
really we've we've amended the bill and
 
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
we've taken the bill sponsored by
 
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
senator geida guida
 
01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
and i believe we've made it
 
01:26:11.110 --> 01:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
far better
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
and something that can work for the
 
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire but we need to
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
stress to all voters and would-be future
 
01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
voters in new hampshire
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
if you show up with your photo
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
identification when you vote when you
 
01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
register to vote on election day and
 
01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
again just though for those same day
 
01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:25.830 align:start position:0%
again just though for those same day
voters

01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
you will vote by with a with a ballot
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
just as everyone else if you register to
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
vote without photo identification
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
proving you are who you say you are
 
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
then this provision of a affidavit
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
ballot gets into effect i think that's
 
01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
very important to remember
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
because everybody should be voting
 
01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
with proper identification
 
01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
so that they don't have to file an
 
01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
affidavit ballot
 
01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
and i just believe that that is what the
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
people of new hampshire uh pursuant to
 
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
the emails and certainly the phone calls
 
01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
that i've been receiving
 
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
they want us to to have this system it's
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
really a check and balance to make sure
 
01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
that every eligible granite state voter
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
that can vote is able to vote
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
and that those that are not eligible are
 
01:27:12.629 --> 01:27:12.639 align:start position:0%
not casting votes in deciding our
 
01:27:14.550 --> 01:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
elections so i look forward to voting
 
01:27:16.229 --> 01:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
and if it goes to a community conference
 
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
i'd be willing to to be one of the few
 
01:27:22.149 --> 01:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
volunteers to serve on it uh in order to
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
continue the conversation um and i want
 
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
to thank the sponsors who brought it
 
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
forward from the senate and i want to
 
01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank representative barry for for his
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to it to make it stronger and
 
01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
i look forward to seeing this go through
 
01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
01:27:35.199 --> 01:27:36.629 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
representative

01:27:36.629 --> 01:27:36.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:27:36.639 --> 01:27:38.709 align:start position:0%
representative
hamlet

01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
hamlet
 
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:41.669 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
so the result of this bill would be to
 
01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
delay the election result
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
we already do require identification we
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
require an id to register
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
or to vote
 
01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
if a person forgets his or her id they
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
have to sign an affidavit already
 
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state follows up on the
 
01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
affidavits after the election
 
01:28:07.830 --> 01:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
and the bottom line is that there is no
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
substantial voter fraud happening in new
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire so there is no reason for this
 
01:28:12.719 --> 01:28:13.750 align:start position:0%
hampshire so there is no reason for this
bill

01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative barry um yes i'll try to
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
be brief um but like representative
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
bergeron said it's hard to
 
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
put such a big bill in two hours and and
 
01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
to be real fast um the first is that
 
01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
voter id is overwhelmingly popular
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
i believe a poll from saint anselm
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
showed that 50 of democrats in new
 
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire support voter id overall with
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
the electorate it's like plus in the 77
 
01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
percent three-fourths of voters support
 
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
showing an id to vote i mean come on
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
like it's it's as representative uh
 
01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
trojan said it's 2022. you can't buy
 
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
cold medicine without an id
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
um the the second the second thing is is
 
01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:50.629 align:start position:0%
um the the second the second thing is is
uh

01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:53.110 --> 01:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
this is about the nvra and i i really
 
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
wish new hampshire would seriously look
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
at the nvra
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not for federalizing our elections i
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
was three when they passed the national
 
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
voter registration act so it's kind of
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh predates me a little bit if you will
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
but there's things in there that would
 
01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:08.719 align:start position:0%
solve basically all of these problems
 
01:29:10.229 --> 01:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
and you know we keep trying to do these
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
workarounds and i may be an unpopular
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
opinion and maybe i'll get attacked by
 
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
both the left and the right for this but
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
we should look at it we should actually
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
have a good faith conversation about it
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
um i want to address two concerns um the
 
01:29:23.110 --> 01:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
first of which is representing the other
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
side uh the delay it's worth the delay
 
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
if you know you're getting the right
 
01:29:31.110 --> 01:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
results so um we currently have a system
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
where and respectfully
 
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
to the representative an affidavit is
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
not an id if you have somebody who's
 
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
committed to double voting signing a
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
piece of paper where you're giving them
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
a fake name and a fake address is it's
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
not a it's not an adherence it's it's a
 
01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
piece of paper i think it's all it is
 
01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's it has legal authority hard to
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
track down somebody when you don't know
 
01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
who they are where they live what their
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
name is how to contact them um
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
so we don't have a system of ids in new
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire we ask for one we do not
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
actually require it and an affidavit is
 
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
a joke um in terms of and um the other
 
01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
side didn't bring this up in the
 
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
testimony today but it was brought up in
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
about the secret ballot
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
and that by how by removing these
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
ballots you'll be revealing how somebody
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
voted uh the fact is is that they
 
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have been voting they didn't
 
01:30:21.189 --> 01:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
meet the qualifications to cast a ballot
 
01:30:23.189 --> 01:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
so you're taking out a ballot that
 
01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
should not have been in there so this
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
notion that the secret ballot has been
 
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
removed it should have never been in
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
there to begin with they didn't meet the
 
01:30:34.149 --> 01:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
qualifications so this is an attempt to
 
01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
to tighten up new hampshire's absolutely
 
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
ludicrous same-day registration system
 
01:30:40.229 --> 01:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
and let me explain and i'll end with
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
this just how ludicrous this is
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
somebody can show up at any polling
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
location in new hampshire any polling
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
location there's 12 in manchester
 
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
they can walk in
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
they can register to vote they present
 
01:30:53.199 --> 01:30:54.149 align:start position:0%
they can register to vote they present
nothing

01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
nothing they
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
boy scout honor their way into a ballot
 
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
they say i am who i say and trust me i'm
 
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
not lying to i promise you i'll sign
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
this piece of paper saying i'm not lying
 
01:31:06.310 --> 01:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
to you and we hand them a regular ballot
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
that goes in with every other ballot
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
most of this state is actually from
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
other states i think i hear as high as
 
01:31:15.750 --> 01:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
70 i don't think it is but it's over 50
 
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
of the state is born somewhere else
 
01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
including myself
 
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
most other states have some form of
 
01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
provisional balloting this is not
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
provisional balloting
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
but when you tell people in new
 
01:31:28.229 --> 01:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire that people who register to
 
01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
vote on election day that present
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
nothing absolutely nothing other than a
 
01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:34.870 align:start position:0%
nothing absolutely nothing other than a
signature

01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
signature
 
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
and they're handed a full ballot they
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
think you're gaslighting them they think
 
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
you're making something up but that is
 
01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
our current system so we're trying to
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
address that system i have never said
 
01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
that voter fraud is rampant in new
 
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire i've never said that i have
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
said in over the last two years of this
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
committee hearing that i think that
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
there is a serious problem with people
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
having faith in the election and there's
 
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
an almost butterfly effect from the fact
 
01:31:57.430 --> 01:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
that we have a system where anybody can
 
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
walk into any polling location present
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
nothing can be handed a ballot that
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
helps breed these conspiracy theories
 
01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
and it's the ultimate form of voter
 
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
suppression when people don't have faith
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
in the ballot they don't go vote
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's the it we're trying to address
 
01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
that this is a very
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
you know i don't even know if it's
 
01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
common sense but it's it's because i
 
01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
think the nvra would be common sense but
 
01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
this is a way to address this issue
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
without doing the nvra i wish we were
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
doing the nbra but once again we'll go
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
into that but that's my piece on this so
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative perez
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh let me speak on this uh
 
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:32.870 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh let me speak on this uh
bill

01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh this is very concerning to me
 
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
someone who wasn't born here and someone
 
01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
who had a hard time register to vote i
 
01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
was sent home three times
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
before i was able to register do you
 
01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
imagine someone who wasn't born here who
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
is a new citizen
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
who haven't like literally haven't get
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
the u.s passport because those were the
 
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
things that i was required to present
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
when i was i was
 
01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
registered to build the first time
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
do you imagine if the person don't have
 
01:33:04.149 --> 01:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
the us passport
 
01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
and they still waiting because the
 
01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
citizenship paperwork it doesn't get it
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
gets in the mail too after you you get
 
01:33:13.110 --> 01:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
your hearing and you swear and
 
01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:14.470 align:start position:0%
your hearing and you swear and
everything

01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
you imagine taking away that from the
 
01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
border that just literally just had the
 
01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
citizenship and they have the right to
 
01:33:23.669 --> 01:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
vote but we're trying to take that away
 
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
from that person
 
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
and i with all the respect from
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
i i you know i
 
01:33:34.149 --> 01:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
i have respect for all you you know your
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
concerns and what you're saying but to
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
be honest we don't want to disfranchise
 
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
more voters
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
and that sounds to me like we trying to
 
01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:44.790 align:start position:0%
and that sounds to me like we trying to
dis-franchise

01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
dis-franchise
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
new citizens and people of already
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
having trouble getting registered to
 
01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:50.390 align:start position:0%
having trouble getting registered to
vote

01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
that's my only concern
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative further
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
discussion representative tarosian thank
 
01:33:58.870 --> 01:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
just to reiterate what we really the
 
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
intent of this legislation is to ensure
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
that people bring their
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
their id to the polls
 
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
before we pass
 
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
and require town clerks to check
 
01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:14.629 align:start position:0%
and require town clerks to check
their

01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
voters ids
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
many people including myself sometimes
 
01:34:20.310 --> 01:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily remember to bring
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
my wallet because i
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
leave it at home many times
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
but once we pass that i made sure i
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
grabbed at least my my driver's license
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
out of my wallet so i had it i think if
 
01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
if this becomes law people will
 
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
it will reinforce
 
01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:38.070 align:start position:0%
it will reinforce
that

01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
to not forget to bring your id with you
 
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
when you go to the polls
 
01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:42.950 align:start position:0%
when you go to the polls
and

01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's that simple in regard to
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that we talked about earlier i'm
 
01:34:49.109 --> 01:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
not advocating i'm not looking at it
 
01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
cavalierly that um
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
there should be one because i believe
 
01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:55.189 align:start position:0%
there should be one because i believe
this

01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
bill as amended
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
should pass scrutiny um i'm just saying
 
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
the reality is that more than likely
 
01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
somebody will which is unfortunate but
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
um those are the
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
the realities of the way we are in
 
01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
society today and that's the re one
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
another one of the reasons for the
 
01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
amendment it helps us address that if if
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
somebody does bring one i hope somebody
 
01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't because i think it's it's a good
 
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative ward
 
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
oh thank you madam chair i i do think
 
01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment makes a uh a bad bill much
 
01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:31.109 align:start position:0%
the amendment makes a uh a bad bill much
better

01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
uh and but in addition to the sort of
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
philosophical disagreements one might
 
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
have with a bill like this it has a
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
number of practical issues that
 
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
probably don't need to go into in
 
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
in great detail but it it confuses the
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
the role of ward moderators with town
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
moderators it sets up a
 
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
process for election officials that's
 
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
cumbersome to the point of being
 
01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.510 align:start position:0%
cumbersome to the point of being
preposterous

01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
preposterous
 
01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:56.950 align:start position:0%
preposterous
um

01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
and it really is a
 
01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
provisional ballot bill i think the
 
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
distinction they're trying to make is a
 
01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
distinction without a difference
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
so for
 
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
both those practical and philosophical
 
01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
reasons i can't vote for this bill
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i want to echo
 
01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
what representative ward just said that
 
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
this is a provisional ballot it is the
 
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
distinction that is made is one that
 
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
really is not a difference
 
01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:31.910 align:start position:0%
really is not a difference
um

01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
to address another point the affidavit
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
is not a joke it subjects someone to a
 
01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
fine of up to five thousand dollars so
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
we have teeth in our existing law to
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
enforce what is already in place
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
also to point out not everyone has a
 
01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
driver's license and i think
 
01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:51.430 align:start position:0%
driver's license and i think
representative

01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
perez addressed that issue not everyone
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
can get a driver's license particularly
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
if you are a new citizen or you don't
 
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
know how to drive
 
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of elderly folks include
 
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
who do not have a driver's license
 
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
or the one they have is expired
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
so there are a lot of issues so if we're
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
going to require driver's license as the
 
01:37:17.109 --> 01:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
only method we need to be careful
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
because there's other ways of providing
 
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
photo identification
 
01:37:25.510 --> 01:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
um i also wanted and i missed the
 
01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:26.470 align:start position:0%
um i also wanted and i missed the
hearing

01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:27.590 align:start position:0%
hearing
so

01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
does this jeopardize our exception to
 
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
the motor voter requirements
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
that in that bill i i honestly don't
 
01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:35.830 align:start position:0%
that in that bill i i honestly don't
know

01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
that's the question i don't know if it
 
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:42.550 align:start position:0%
 
i'm

01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:37:44.709 --> 01:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sorry representative lane i've
 
01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
got a procedural issue that just came to
 
01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
my attention okay well my question was i
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
missed the hearing
 
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
um last week so mike did someone address
 
01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
that this may jeopardize our exception
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
to the motor voter requirement and i
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
think that's the bill that represented
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
barry may have been referring to
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
i i don't think so but representative
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
barry uh yes i believe the brennan
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
center for justice actually did address
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
that um i ironically i believe their uh
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
their representative did that as an
 
01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:16.159 align:start position:0%
attempt to dissuade me from supporting
 
01:38:16.159 --> 01:38:17.109 align:start position:0%
attempt to dissuade me from supporting
this

01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:38:18.629 --> 01:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
not realizing that i would love the if
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
the nvra was kicked in um to another
 
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
point we said about just a driver's
 
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
license i think it's uh 659 13 outlines
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
all the forms of id that we take
 
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
up to and including like a college id
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
from dartmouth
 
01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:33.109 align:start position:0%
from dartmouth
um

01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
so i i unless you were just making a
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
reference about expired licenses then i
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
apologize by putting words in your mouth
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
um i wouldn't wouldn't want to do that
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
but i just want to address that point
 
01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:44.470 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
chair

01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh and i would like to expand upon the
 
01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:47.910 align:start position:0%
uh and i would like to expand upon the
uh

01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
the testimony from the speaker from the
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
brennan center center relative to the
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
national voter registration act also
 
01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
called motor voter
 
01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:56.149 align:start position:0%
called motor voter
um

01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
some of the points made is that
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
the motor voter laws
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
says that all voters
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
the exemptions require that all voters
 
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
in the state be able to register on
 
01:39:08.149 --> 01:39:08.159 align:start position:0%
election day
 
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
they must be
 
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
able to register at the polling place
 
01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
and such registration must be at the
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
time of voting in the federal general
 
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
election so there is a real there were
 
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
other reasons given but there is a real
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
possibility that enactment of this bill
 
01:39:26.470 --> 01:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
might remove new hampshire's exemption
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
from the national voter registration act
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
and i believe and and i can stand to be
 
01:39:33.669 --> 01:39:33.679 align:start position:0%
corrected that the
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's estimate of the
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
cost to implement motor voter was about
 
01:39:42.550 --> 01:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
just like quit uh
 
01:39:46.629 --> 01:39:46.639 align:start position:0%
ripping brother do you have to answer
 
01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
this question if you don't want to um
 
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
but it
 
01:39:51.990 --> 01:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
could we in theory pass a and
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
tangentially really do this queen theory
 
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
pass a a law that banned same-day
 
01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
registration for people casting a state
 
01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
ballot where they could only get a
 
01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
federal ballot would that be in your
 
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
opinion in line with the nvra
 
01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:11.590 --> 01:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion on this
 
01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
um i i will say that uh you may have
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
recalled during the the meeting i i
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
asked just
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
for me
 
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
uh that i asked to speak to the person
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
from the brennan center and we went
 
01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.669 align:start position:0%
from the brennan center and we went
outside

01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
outside
 
01:40:25.590 --> 01:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
because i wanted to
 
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
i asked her for the exemption that we
 
01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:30.159 align:start position:0%
have to the nbra
 
01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
because it's been something i've been on
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
this search for for a while
 
01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
and she didn't have it she went back to
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
an old memo that she had so we talk
 
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
about triggering all sorts of things and
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
i think they're they're grossly
 
01:40:42.639 --> 01:40:43.990 align:start position:0%
i think they're they're grossly
premature

01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
premature
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
um in regards to the voter id this is
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
beginning to sound a little bit like the
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
arguments that occurred in this body
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
before i was a member of it in regards
 
01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
to the institution of the requirement of
 
01:40:55.590 --> 01:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
voter id to the extent we have it
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
because there was much discussion and
 
01:40:59.189 --> 01:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
objection to it that it was going to
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
cause all sorts of problems
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
um and the reality is it sort of was
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
enacted with basically a whimper
 
01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
and i do want to just provide
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
information for the committee and people
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
who might be listening
 
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
we're doing a lot of talking about
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
affidavits and possibly changing things
 
01:41:19.109 --> 01:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
and what this will mean what we're
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
talking about is something where we have
 
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
a count on election night and it might
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
change in seven days
 
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
this is still far ahead of pretty much
 
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
every other state in the united states
 
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
in regards to when they have their
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
official voting results
 
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
um so the question becomes if we don't
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
have substantial fraud and i would
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
posit that that's not what is necessary
 
01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
for the state to have an interest in
 
01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
ensuring that all ballots are cast by
 
01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
qualified voters
 
01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
what exactly would the impact of this be
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
because we also heard testimony from a
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
representative who lost a race by a vote
 
01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:56.790 align:start position:0%
representative who lost a race by a vote
so

01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
what is the potential in a primary that
 
01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
we are actually going to
 
01:42:05.669 --> 01:42:05.679 align:start position:0%
result in a change in the winner because
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about the
 
01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
issue of printing a ballot after a
 
01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
primary for someone to vote on because
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
otherwise there really isn't an issue
 
01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
and in 2020 um with information provided
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
by the secretary of state's office
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%

141 of those were resolved by the

referral for investigation and 45 are
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
currently in investigation
 
01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
qualified voter affidavits

01:42:55.750 --> 01:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
2020.
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
32 people returned their postcards that
 
01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
even that's even pretty dismal for a
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
survey when you put it out and you're
 
01:43:04.830 --> 01:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
hoping for a response rate
 
01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
290 s
 
01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
never simply never came back
 
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
no they got sent somewhere put into
 
01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere and never got returned and 40
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
were actually returned as undeliverable
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
and challenge voter affidavits which is
 
01:43:25.109 --> 01:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
the no id
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
there were a total of 733
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
completed throughout the state
 
01:43:32.189 --> 01:43:32.199 align:start position:0%
of those
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
438 returned the follow-up card
 
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
215 did not respond in other words those
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
cards did not come back they ended up
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere no one returned them and 45
 
01:43:49.109 --> 01:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
were returned as undeliverable
 
01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
i believe we heard testimony in another
 
01:43:52.709 --> 01:43:52.719 align:start position:0%
hearing from people who were following
 
01:43:54.149 --> 01:43:54.159 align:start position:0%
up and finding out that a lot of these
 
01:43:56.709 --> 01:43:56.719 align:start position:0%
cards were sent to homes where new
 
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
owners were saying yeah we get mail for
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
this person all the time they're not
 
01:44:01.510 --> 01:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
here it goes in the trash
 
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
and we also heard testimony about the
 
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
one person one vote but so what we're
 
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
talking about potentially
 
01:44:09.070 --> 01:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
um for
 
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
733 if we take 2020 which was an
 
01:44:14.590 --> 01:44:14.600 align:start position:0%
extraordinary turnout
 
01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
438 return the card so that means we are
 
01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
talking about that number of people and
 
01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
45 returned as undeliverable i would
 
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
posit that that might be the people that
 
01:44:28.629 --> 01:44:28.639 align:start position:0%
people are worried were somehow
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
disenfranchising by not voting meeting
 
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
requirements it's not disenfranchising
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
um so just so you have those numbers for
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
your records i thought that would be
 
01:44:37.679 --> 01:44:38.950 align:start position:0%
your records i thought that would be
helpful

01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
um the motion on the floor
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%

01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:48.880 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
um sb425 establishes the uh i think we
 
01:46:33.669 --> 01:46:33.679 align:start position:0%
saw a similar bill last year about the
 
01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
online portal um
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
it has a it has a price a price tag of
 
01:46:40.709 --> 01:46:40.719 align:start position:0%
11.5 million dollars
 
01:46:42.149 --> 01:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
which is pretty incredible we just
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
talked about the nvra would only cost us
 
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
six million dollars not that i'm pushing
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
the nbra today um
 
01:46:50.229 --> 01:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
but um 11.5 million dollars i look at
 
01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
that into kind of things that we've
 
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
passed this year that caused um you know
 
01:46:57.590 --> 01:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
heart attacks efas letting you know
 
01:46:59.350 --> 01:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged and working class families
 
01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
have access to different schools is 8.4
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
million and we lost our mind over that
 
01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
um so 11.5 million dollars for basically
 
01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
a website and a database that probably
 
01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
programmed in sql with some python
 
01:47:11.590 --> 01:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
background um
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
would uh is a little a little absorbent
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:47:17.109 --> 01:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
it's in attacking in things that um
 
01:47:18.629 --> 01:47:18.639 align:start position:0%
would be in the nvra making you should
 
01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
register to vote that sort of stuff but
 
01:47:20.950 --> 01:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
it comes with none of the integrity
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
measures so until we get serious about
 
01:47:24.790 --> 01:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
this stuff i'm going to be voting no and
 
01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to be putting an 11.5
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:34.390 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam

01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
this legislation and expedient to
 
01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:39.830 align:start position:0%
this legislation and expedient to
legislate

01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:41.750 align:start position:0%
legislate
um

01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
well i
 
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate the reference to the
 
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
financial note here saying that it's
 
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
going to cost 10 000
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
over a period of uh three fiscal years
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh to implement this system i find that
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
really hard to believe sometimes if you
 
01:47:57.030 --> 01:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
look into the details of how those
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
numbers are arrived at
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
the department of information technology
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
for example is saying that maintenance
 
01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
and operations will need to be increased
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
to four full-time equivalents
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry we've seen a lot of bills
 
01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
come before this committee where uh some
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
of the departments say well i'm going to
 
01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:14.790 align:start position:0%
of the departments say well i'm going to
need

01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:48:16.629 --> 01:48:16.639 align:start position:0%
an additional full-time person in each
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
of the substations of the
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle division to implement this
 
01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:21.430 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle division to implement this
provision

01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it's just an opportunity
 
01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:31.109 --> 01:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
and this assumes the fiscal new note
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
assumes that the software and licenses
 
01:48:36.550 --> 01:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
are all going to be developed in-house
 
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's not what the bill says actually
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
the bill says that this
 
01:48:43.669 --> 01:48:43.679 align:start position:0%
idea or
 
01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
suggestion for voter information portal
 
01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
will be developed in consultation with
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
the department of information technology
 
01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
i would also point out that the
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office currently is
 
01:48:57.669 --> 01:48:57.679 align:start position:0%
is going through an rfp process to try
 
01:48:57.679 --> 01:48:58.950 align:start position:0%
is going through an rfp process to try
and

01:48:58.950 --> 01:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:01.510 --> 01:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
establish a new voter uh registration
 
01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:02.390 align:start position:0%
establish a new voter uh registration
system

01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:49:04.390 --> 01:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
the the current one is is antiquated it
 
01:49:06.310 --> 01:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
can't be used with uh some of the more
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
modern browsers uh
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
particularly in terms of microsoft um
 
01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
and it's it's it's breaking apart we had
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
testimony during one of our hearings on
 
01:49:16.629 --> 01:49:16.639 align:start position:0%
a different bill this this session for
 
01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
example that if you wanted to have an
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
updated absentee voter request list
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
you might be able to get it in a few
 
01:49:25.510 --> 01:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
months because the software is breaking
 
01:49:27.990 --> 01:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
down so much so to me it makes perfect
 
01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
sense that
 
01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
the work
 
01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
that will need to be done
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
to help develop or design
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
an election information portal
 
01:49:41.830 --> 01:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
should probably be done simultaneously
 
01:49:43.270 --> 01:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
with the development of new voter
 
01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
registration software and therefore i
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
will be supporting the bill because one
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
i don't believe the fiscal note and two
 
01:49:52.950 --> 01:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh i think in terms of efficiency this
 
01:49:55.669 --> 01:49:55.679 align:start position:0%
is the time to do it
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative sweeney thank you madam
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
chair uh very briefly um i'll be
 
01:50:01.990 --> 01:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
supporting the motion of any speeding to
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
legislate but knowing how sometimes
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
policy that switches from one body to
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
the other somehow finds a way back uh in
 
01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
later april and may i do want to just
 
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
note for the record that i also have
 
01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
concerns not only with the fiscal note
 
01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%
of the bill but during the testimony
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
there was reference to consumer data
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
being commingled into this online
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
election portal
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
tying individuals financial histories
 
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
and their purchases and even my even
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
having card uh even either debit or
 
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
credit card information stored on that
 
01:50:35.109 --> 01:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
file i am very uh uneasy with the idea
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
of the state getting into that sort of
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
data collection process of voters or
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
residents or whatnot
 
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
so if somehow this policy or this bill
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
finds its way back uh either this
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
session in another vehicle or or in the
 
01:50:48.639 --> 01:50:49.669 align:start position:0%
session in another vehicle or or in the
future

01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
i think that's a real concern that
 
01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
members of this committee or any
 
01:50:54.550 --> 01:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
committee that it goes to
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
needs to protect the the individual's
 
01:50:58.229 --> 01:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
privacy and the data
 
01:50:59.669 --> 01:50:59.679 align:start position:0%
that is being collected and that was
 
01:51:01.109 --> 01:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
just one thing from the testimony that
 
01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
alarmed me and wanted to put that on the
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
record so we were all aware of it thank
 
01:51:05.119 --> 01:51:07.109 align:start position:0%
record so we were all aware of it thank
you

01:51:07.109 --> 01:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
chair uh just a quick follow-up to those
 
01:51:14.070 --> 01:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
comments the uh
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
maybe that's why the
 
01:51:17.669 --> 01:51:17.679 align:start position:0%
dollar amount of the estimate for this
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
kind of program is so high because
 
01:51:22.470 --> 01:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
there's no need for the state to develop
 
01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:23.510 align:start position:0%
there's no need for the state to develop
a

01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:24.870 align:start position:0%
a
credit

01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
credit
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
credit based authentication or knowledge
 
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
based authentication system
 
01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
those are already exist and i would be
 
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
willing to bet a lot of you have already
 
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
used these for different purposes where
 
01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
you're trying to access information or a
 
01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
record or make corrections to uh to a
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
credit card
 
01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:43.030 align:start position:0%
credit card
database

01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
database
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
suddenly five or six
 
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
screens will pop up and we'll say choose
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
one of the following addresses where you
 
01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
previously lived at or you have lived at
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
the current residence for x number of
 
01:51:54.390 --> 01:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
years and they're all multiple choice
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
questions that's information that's
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
gathered by third party software it
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
scours credit bureau reports it scours
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
public records and then throws up a
 
01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
series of questions for the person to uh
 
01:52:07.510 --> 01:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
to answer it's it's an established
 
01:52:10.470 --> 01:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
well-used process it's not tied into the
 
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
voter registration system or the example
 
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
i gave during
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
the hearing to our vital records system
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
it resides outside of all that so um i
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
thought it was an interesting suggestion
 
01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
but again we're talking about forming a
 
01:52:26.149 --> 01:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
study committee and perhaps the study
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
committee will say well we don't even
 
01:52:28.790 --> 01:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
want to use that there's other systems
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
out there that would be cheaper and
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
easier for our public so
 
01:52:34.070 --> 01:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
um that's what that's what a study
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
committee is for and and with that i
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
will end my comments
 
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
i thank you representative bergeron if i
 
01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
can say in response i don't understand
 
01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
this to be the formation of a study
 
01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:46.790 align:start position:0%
this to be the formation of a study
committee

01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
which is why i'm going to be voting
 
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
against it um i think i expressed
 
01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
concern in the hearing about the
 
01:52:54.870 --> 01:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
composition of who's going to be in
 
01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
consultation for doing this and not that
 
01:52:58.950 --> 01:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think that we have wonderful
 
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
staff throughout the state but the idea
 
01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
of sort of giving what appeared to me to
 
01:53:04.709 --> 01:53:04.719 align:start position:0%
be pretty
 
01:53:04.719 --> 01:53:05.910 align:start position:0%
be pretty
um

01:53:05.910 --> 01:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
the group identified without any sort of
 
01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:15.109 align:start position:0%
the group identified without any sort of
outside

01:53:15.109 --> 01:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
outside
 
01:53:15.119 --> 01:53:16.229 align:start position:0%
outside
oversight

01:53:16.229 --> 01:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:53:19.750 --> 01:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:21.270 --> 01:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
for the expenditure of 10 million
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
dollars did not seem appropriate to me
 
01:53:26.310 --> 01:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
and again we may or may not agree that
 
01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars but what we also
 
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
heard was doit
 
01:53:32.149 --> 01:53:32.159 align:start position:0%
is is thinking about this as the basis
 
01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
for doing other things for other
 
01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
departments and i think what i heard was
 
01:53:37.270 --> 01:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
and that cost is going to come down as
 
01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
they're doing other work for other
 
01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
departments almost like we're taking the
 
01:53:41.350 --> 01:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars and spreading it
 
01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:43.270 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars and spreading it
around

01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
even though it's still 10 million 10
 
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars if it was the study
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
committee i i probably would have been
 
01:53:50.229 --> 01:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
more in favor of it but it basically
 
01:53:50.239 --> 01:53:51.030 align:start position:0%
more in favor of it but it basically
says

01:53:51.030 --> 01:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
you you go out and do it but don't have
 
01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
it usable before january 1st of 2023.
 
01:53:57.040 --> 01:53:58.070 align:start position:0%
it usable before january 1st of 2023.
um

01:53:58.070 --> 01:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:58.080 --> 01:53:59.189 align:start position:0%
um
i

01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
thought about doing an amendment for a
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
study committee for this i frankly
 
01:54:05.669 --> 01:54:05.679 align:start position:0%
didn't couldn't get to it
 
01:54:07.510 --> 01:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
i frankly would have been more in favor
 
01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
of a budget for allocation of hiring a
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
vendor to make recommendations for the
 
01:54:15.189 --> 01:54:15.199 align:start position:0%
implementation of an information portal
 
01:54:17.189 --> 01:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
that addresses this and then if there
 
01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
are other departments that wanted to get
 
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
on it to do that i think representative
 
01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
bergeron pointed out in the hearing that
 
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:25.679 align:start position:0%
there appears to be subscription
 
01:54:27.589 --> 01:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
services being used now in our town and
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
cities that may or may not have been
 
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
accounted for in connection with putting
 
01:54:33.990 --> 01:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
this bill together um so i think there
 
01:54:36.149 --> 01:54:36.159 align:start position:0%
were a number of reasons during that the
 
01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:37.679 align:start position:0%
committee hearing that led me to believe
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
that this was not ready to go forward
 
01:54:43.350 --> 01:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
so i will be supporting the motion to
 
01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:44.550 align:start position:0%
so i will be supporting the motion to
itl

01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
itl
 
01:54:46.149 --> 01:54:46.159 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
just one final point about government
 
01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:50.310 align:start position:0%
just one final point about government
contracts

01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
people who contract with the government
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
have an amazing ability to bring things
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
in right at the maximum quote
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
so if you tell them they got 11.5
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:06.390 --> 01:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:07.840 align:start position:0%

uh yes very briefly madam chairman
 
01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh the provisions the modifications this
 
01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
bill proposes
 
01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
are very vague uh very open-ended and
 
01:56:50.070 --> 01:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
frankly the current
 
01:56:52.950 --> 01:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
allowances for absentee ballot uh
 
01:56:56.070 --> 01:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
absentee participation are sufficient
 
01:56:59.270 --> 01:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
and this bill is unnecessary
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion
 
01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:02.719 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:57:06.790 --> 01:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
um this bill passed the senate on a
 
01:57:09.990 --> 01:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
voice vote had bipartisan support
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
it adds
 
01:57:13.750 --> 01:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
to the reasons for require requesting
 
01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot the words illness or
 
01:57:17.990 --> 01:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
other medical condition
 
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
and there are illnesses or other medical
 
01:57:22.149 --> 01:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
conditions as a sponsor noted
 
01:57:24.149 --> 01:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
during a testimony that don't fall
 
01:57:25.589 --> 01:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
within the category of physical
 
01:57:25.599 --> 01:57:26.870 align:start position:0%
within the category of physical
disability

01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
disability
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
um i can think of an example where a
 
01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
family member had
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
prostate surgery a couple of days before
 
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
the election and was in no condition to
 
01:57:38.229 --> 01:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
no medical condition to go to the
 
01:57:40.709 --> 01:57:40.719 align:start position:0%
polling place he had to
 
01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
get an absentee ballot uh
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
he lives in another state brought to him
 
01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
by a family member
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
if someone has the measles that's not
 
01:57:50.790 --> 01:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily a physical disability but i
 
01:57:52.229 --> 01:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
don't think the the voters should be
 
01:57:54.149 --> 01:57:54.159 align:start position:0%
going to the polling place and i think
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
everybody at the polling place would
 
01:57:57.669 --> 01:57:57.679 align:start position:0%
rather that person stay home too
 
01:58:00.070 --> 01:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
so there are reasons legitimate reasons
 
01:58:01.990 --> 01:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
when people may be ill or have other
 
01:58:04.229 --> 01:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
medical conditions uh where they are
 
01:58:06.070 --> 01:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
they should be entitled to vote absentee
 
01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
and therefore i will be
 
01:58:08.950 --> 01:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
opposing the motion to find this and
 
01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and will be
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill if a motion about to
 
01:58:16.470 --> 01:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:20.320 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:02:50.790 --> 02:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
i had noted a question in paragraph 8a
 
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
in regards to the statutory references
 
02:02:57.510 --> 02:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
and the penalty amount
 
02:02:59.669 --> 02:02:59.679 align:start position:0%
apparently on the senate side that
 
02:03:01.589 --> 02:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
question had been raised while they were
 
02:03:04.149 --> 02:03:04.159 align:start position:0%
deliberating by the ag's office but it
 
02:03:06.629 --> 02:03:06.639 align:start position:0%
was not addressed by the senate
 
02:03:08.229 --> 02:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
i received word from the attorney
 
02:03:11.109 --> 02:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
general's office this monday about we
 
02:03:12.629 --> 02:03:12.639 align:start position:0%
have this amendment that needs to be
 
02:03:15.189 --> 02:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
done that and i have not received a
 
02:03:17.430 --> 02:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
response from the senate side as to
 
02:03:19.510 --> 02:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
their preference
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
what you have before you is the attorney
 
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
general's recommended change
 
02:03:27.669 --> 02:03:27.679 align:start position:0%
to this provision
 
02:03:30.750 --> 02:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
which adds the reference to
 
02:03:32.709 --> 02:03:32.719 align:start position:0%
66417 which
 
02:03:35.669 --> 02:03:35.679 align:start position:0%
was needed in the section to begin with
 
02:03:38.229 --> 02:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
and makes the civil penalty
 
02:03:38.239 --> 02:03:39.390 align:start position:0%
and makes the civil penalty
fine

02:03:39.390 --> 02:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
fine
 
02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:41.109 align:start position:0%
fine
consistent

02:03:41.109 --> 02:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
02:03:41.119 --> 02:03:43.270 align:start position:0%
consistent
with

02:03:43.270 --> 02:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
what the law is
 
02:03:49.589 --> 02:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
and in other statutes so that is the
 
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
purpose of this amendment um obviously
 
02:03:55.430 --> 02:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
this bill will be amended now that we
 
02:03:58.390 --> 02:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
are reconsidering this bill i will need
 
02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
to not what will happen is we need
 
02:04:03.669 --> 02:04:03.679 align:start position:0%
another vote
 
02:04:06.629 --> 02:04:06.639 align:start position:0%
on the amendment we already passed which
 
02:04:08.830 --> 02:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
i would request that you vote for
 
02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:10.550 align:start position:0%
i would request that you vote for
again

02:04:10.550 --> 02:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
because after reconsidering my
 
02:04:14.149 --> 02:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
reconsideration i really don't want you
 
02:04:16.709 --> 02:04:16.719 align:start position:0%
to reconsider it so i want you
 
02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
um to vote in favor of 1383
 
02:04:23.350 --> 02:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
and then i am going to request an
 
02:04:25.149 --> 02:04:25.159 align:start position:0%
affirmative vote on
 
02:04:25.159 --> 02:04:26.709 align:start position:0%
affirmative vote on
1499

02:04:26.709 --> 02:04:26.719 align:start position:0%
1499
 
02:04:29.189 --> 02:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
and staff would then in connection with
 
02:04:32.069 --> 02:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
the processing of it um create a
 
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
consolidated amendment
 
02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:38.709 align:start position:0%
consolidated amendment
questions

02:04:38.709 --> 02:04:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:40.719 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron uh
 
02:04:43.109 --> 02:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
for the comment if i make yeah sure
 
02:04:43.119 --> 02:04:44.310 align:start position:0%
for the comment if i make yeah sure
um

02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:46.629 --> 02:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
what the chair is referring to
 
02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
with this second amendment uh pertains
 
02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
to page two of the original bill lines
 
02:04:55.109 --> 02:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
10 through 12 and i had questioned that
 
02:04:56.310 --> 02:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:04:57.750 --> 02:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
i thought maybe it was a typo where it
 
02:05:01.189 --> 02:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
says rsa 664 colon 14 because that
 
02:05:03.350 --> 02:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
statute refers to political advertising
 
02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
which is not mentioned anywhere else in
 
02:05:07.350 --> 02:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
the in the bill
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
i thought maybe it was supposed to be
 
02:05:11.109 --> 02:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
17. so this amendment that's being
 
02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
brought forward i think clarifies the
 
02:05:14.310 --> 02:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
the confusion
 
02:05:16.790 --> 02:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
and uh i i will support the first
 
02:05:18.149 --> 02:05:18.159 align:start position:0%
amendment we already approved the second
 
02:05:19.990 --> 02:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
one that's being put before us and then
 
02:05:23.910 --> 02:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
so yes yes and yes we are going out on a
 
02:05:30.069 --> 02:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
bang everybody this will be three i'm
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
hoping we'll see what happens
 
02:05:33.750 --> 02:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
all right so we're going to need three
 
02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:35.189 align:start position:0%
all right so we're going to need three
votes

02:05:35.189 --> 02:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
votes
 
02:05:37.270 --> 02:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
one on
 
02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
one on
 
02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:44.550 align:start position:0%
one on
1499

02:05:44.550 --> 02:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
1499
 
02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
and then one as otp
 
02:05:50.149 --> 02:05:50.159 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
02:05:52.870 --> 02:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
i know i know i just want to look for my
 
02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:54.069 align:start position:0%
i know i know i just want to look for my
clerk

02:05:54.069 --> 02:05:54.079 align:start position:0%

okay so this one right now
 
02:06:00.069 --> 02:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
no no no that's not the form she needs
 
02:06:01.750 --> 02:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
she needs a roll call sheet what about
 
02:06:01.760 --> 02:06:02.950 align:start position:0%
she needs a roll call sheet what about
these

02:06:02.950 --> 02:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:04.400 align:start position:0%

we cleaned up the work of the senate at

that may need to attend as

the senate or this body may decide is
 
02:11:17.669 --> 02:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate which may require further
 
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
committee meetings so
 
02:11:21.109 --> 02:11:21.119 align:start position:0%
um i think that's where we're at
 
02:11:23.109 --> 02:11:23.119 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%

02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
more pointed
 
02:12:08.550 --> 02:12:08.560 align:start position:0%

02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
