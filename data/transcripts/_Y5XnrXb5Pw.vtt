00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:15.409 --> 00:21:15.419 align:start position:0%
we s
 
00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:18.419 align:start position:0%
but right now uh
 
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:21.860 align:start position:0%
we've had some oh
 
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
oh okay yeah I know that's better that's
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
too many too many I'm too laid back a
 
00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
person but we're any further back I'd be
 
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
I'd be uh they'd be throwing Dirt on My
 
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.149 align:start position:0%
I'd be uh they'd be throwing Dirt on My
Grave

00:21:35.149 --> 00:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
Grave
 
00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
they say oh he looks he's dead
 
00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:42.529 align:start position:0%
they say oh he looks he's dead
okay

00:21:42.529 --> 00:21:42.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.850 align:start position:0%
all right uh
we've

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:45.860 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
I'm trying well the goal I I think we've
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
tried with the work with this work
 
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
session has been
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
to try to come to some kind of
 
00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.630 align:start position:0%
to try to come to some kind of
agreement

00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
that we could
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
we could have a
 
00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
if not a majority
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
at least excuse me it's not a unanimous
 
00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
at least a strong majority
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
on the uh
 
00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
for a for an amendment to you know and
 
00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
pass the the bill because they I think
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
we do see value
 
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
at least uh relative to this bill
 
00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:35.820 align:start position:0%
from last last session when the interim
 
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
study that we did
 
00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.230 align:start position:0%
study that we did
uh

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
the right now I've haven't
 
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
I don't believe we're there
 
00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
not even close I we haven't had much in
 
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
the way of
 
00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:55.700 align:start position:0%
of this of any
 
00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
any meeting of the minds
 
00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.169 align:start position:0%
any meeting of the minds
uh

00:23:00.169 --> 00:23:00.179 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
that's why I canceled
 
00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:07.799 align:start position:0%
the executive session I didn't believe I
 
00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh to go into executive session uh and
 
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
it would be unfair
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
to have a meeting and have people
 
00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.870 align:start position:0%
to have a meeting and have people
uh

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
being assigned to vote
 
00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.610 align:start position:0%
being assigned to vote
on

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
on the the executive session
 
00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:34.860 align:start position:0%
and not have it so that's why I canceled
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
it uh what I'm going to propose
 
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.090 align:start position:0%
it uh what I'm going to propose
is

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.070 align:start position:0%
is
a

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.649 align:start position:0%
a
subcommittee

00:23:45.649 --> 00:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:23:48.409 --> 00:23:48.419 align:start position:0%
of so of
 
00:23:48.419 --> 00:23:50.510 align:start position:0%
of so of
individuals

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
it'll be an even subcommittee
 
00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:58.690 align:start position:0%
it'll be an even subcommittee
uh

00:23:58.690 --> 00:23:58.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
proposing is this is a gum going to
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
propose a subcommittee
 
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.970 align:start position:0%
propose a subcommittee
uh

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
where we the the subcommittee would be
 
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
charged with coming up with a
 
00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.350 align:start position:0%
charged with coming up with a
bipartisan

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.149 align:start position:0%
 
Amendment

00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to to be a bipartisan
 
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
amendment to be able to uh
 
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
get enough on the bill
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
to make both
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
and that's I haven't going to propose it
 
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
but not yet I want to have here to some
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
discussion on that
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
representative Darby has done extensive
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
research on this bill he's talked to a
 
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
lot of stakeholders
 
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
um I I actually think the work he's done
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
would be the same work that a
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would do so I'd like to
 
00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
suggest that he give a background a
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
summary of what he's done and what he's
 
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
um you know some of the the learnings
 
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
he's had because I think we may have the
 
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
information after that to just to be
 
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
able to move forward to schedule the
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
executive session and as far as not
 
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
knowing where people stand I it might be
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
worthwhile also to go around the
 
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
committee and ask people where they
 
00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
stand because I don't even know my ex
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
outside of our caucus I don't know where
 
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
people stand on this bill there may be
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
people that you know would support an
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
amendment consistent with the research
 
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:51.370 align:start position:0%
 
we

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:51.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative the KIPP thank you Mr
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
chairman uh yeah I think I appreciate
 
00:25:59.570 --> 00:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
representative brung's comments and all
 
00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:01.559 align:start position:0%
the work that representative Darby has
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
done and I think it's uh equal to the
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
work that a lot of us have done myself
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
included I think I'll probably put in
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
about the same amount of time with
 
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
representative Darby has and appreciate
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
his uh 12 30 in the morning emails
 
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
including the last two drafts I actually
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the official drafts of his
 
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
latest two amendments uh from OLS I
 
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:25.740 align:start position:0%
suspect he has copies for us now so I'm
 
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
looking forward to reviewing those so
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
we've got three amendments floating
 
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
around there now and it's hard to form
 
00:26:36.049 --> 00:26:36.059 align:start position:0%
an opinion on those until we see those
 
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
drafts and I think that's the intent of
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
of the subcommittee here we have you
 
00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
know 20 or 18 or so members and three
 
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.510 align:start position:0%
know 20 or 18 or so members and three
amendments

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
so it's a lot of cooks if we have a
 
00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
small group that can look at those three
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
amendments and perhaps come up with one
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
out of those three or combination of
 
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
wording out of those three amendments
 
00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
and then present it to the larger group
 
00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
a single bipartisan Amendment
 
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:07.140 align:start position:0%
I mean I think it we want to it sounds
 
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
like we want to pass something
 
00:27:12.289 --> 00:27:12.299 align:start position:0%
that satisfies the bipartisan group of
 
00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:14.039 align:start position:0%
sponsors of Senator Waters Senator
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
Carson Senator avard and others
 
00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:17.570 align:start position:0%
Carson Senator avard and others
um

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
I I spoke just last night with the uh
 
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
you know I got a call from Jennifer at
 
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire preservation society
 
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
and who was quite pleased with the
 
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:29.940 align:start position:0%
amendment that I last presented I spoke
 
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
last night at an event with Senator
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
Carson uh and she had some
 
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
you know some input so there's a lot of
 
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
information floating around there that I
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
think that would be useful in the
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so rather than pulling the
 
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
committee now in advance
 
00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.059 align:start position:0%
before they have all the information I
 
00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:49.559 align:start position:0%
think we ought to go
 
00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:51.179 align:start position:0%
to a subcommittee
 
00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of a subcommittee is
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
to to let them
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
chew on all the data and then report
 
00:27:59.090 --> 00:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
back to the larger committee and I don't
 
00:28:00.649 --> 00:28:00.659 align:start position:0%
even really care to be on the
 
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to be honest with that I
 
00:28:03.409 --> 00:28:03.419 align:start position:0%
will I'll happily serve if the chair
 
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
wants me to
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
um but other other folks can can serve
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
representative La Montagne
 
00:28:15.769 --> 00:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I
 
00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:18.779 align:start position:0%
I think we're all here now we've all
 
00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:22.919 align:start position:0%
here we've come here to do the work of
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
studying the bill together
 
00:28:27.529 --> 00:28:27.539 align:start position:0%
and I don't see
 
00:28:30.649 --> 00:28:30.659 align:start position:0%
why we can't
 
00:28:33.529 --> 00:28:33.539 align:start position:0%
um spend the time now
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
to see if we can't come up with a bill
 
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
that we can exec on in the future even
 
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
if it is a subcommittee within this
 
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
group here that does most of the talking
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
about it I think we can get there
 
00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:52.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative Darby oh by the way I did
 
00:28:59.090 --> 00:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
get uh your uh uh the emails that you
 
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
sent me and I am impressed what you've
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
done so uh
 
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for uh
 
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
um so I I am with uh representative
 
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
LaMontagne I'm I'm not making a taking a
 
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
statement on making a position on
 
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
whether or not we should have a
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but I do think that there's
 
00:29:24.049 --> 00:29:24.059 align:start position:0%
some value in getting out the discussing
 
00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:25.799 align:start position:0%
the positions and what the approaches
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
are to
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
um various amendments and so that we can
 
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
hear from the members of the committee
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
about where their concerns might be in
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
together rather than in a smaller form
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
um and I think you know I I've
 
00:29:42.169 --> 00:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
um I spent a few minutes
 
00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
um you know with representative Donnelly
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
represent representative McHugh last
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
last week and um and I think that it'd
 
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:52.740 align:start position:0%
be better to rather than having sort of
 
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
these one and two one and two Z
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
discussions like you mentioned I I'd
 
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
sent you some some inputs
 
00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.289 align:start position:0%
sent you some some inputs
um

00:30:00.289 --> 00:30:00.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
just to just to lay out if they're just
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
to hear where the concerns are and where
 
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.409 align:start position:0%
to hear where the concerns are and where
the

00:30:06.409 --> 00:30:06.419 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:06.419 --> 00:30:07.250 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
the where the areas of compromise need
 
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:18.200 align:start position:0%
any other uh
 
00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:26.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:30.169 --> 00:30:30.179 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'm I'm I feel like we haven't
 
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
really worked we had work sessions where
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
we heard other people speak to us but
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
personally I don't feel like we've had a
 
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
chance to talk to each other about where
 
00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
the issue is and I'm really confused
 
00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
about where the sticking point is
 
00:30:45.169 --> 00:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
because originally when this bill came
 
00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
to us I was like why do we need this we
 
00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
treat I I don't understand why are we
 
00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:52.820 align:start position:0%
making this specific and special to
 
00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
African-Americans so I went and did some
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
homework on my own and realized that
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
they were slaves they didn't have last
 
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
names they couldn't be traced I went to
 
00:31:09.889 --> 00:31:09.899 align:start position:0%
the Portsmouth the new Memorial I read a
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
lot about how these human beings were
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
treated as property and not any better
 
00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:19.740 align:start position:0%
than a tractor or a cow you know they
 
00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:21.299 align:start position:0%
when they were done with them they were
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
just discarded and now in my heart I
 
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:28.140 align:start position:0%
truly believe that we need to do what is
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
right and just and respectful and
 
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
graceful with those human bones and and
 
00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm unsure where we're sticking in
 
00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
in these amendments and this issue and
 
00:31:45.409 --> 00:31:45.419 align:start position:0%
and I really need some help getting
 
00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
getting understanding that thank you
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative of the Q
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
would the would the member
 
00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.490 --> 00:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
would would you believe that the state
 
00:32:00.889 --> 00:32:00.899 align:start position:0%
archaeologist testified that they in
 
00:32:03.409 --> 00:32:03.419 align:start position:0%
fact do that now and would you believe
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
would you further believe that I agree
 
00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
with you that it wouldn't hurt at all
 
00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:09.299 align:start position:0%
for us to codify
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
what what you said
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
he did say that you go through that but
 
00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:15.539 align:start position:0%
he also but he said their track through
 
00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
last names
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
you know and so then indentured
 
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
Serpentine they attract these these
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
beings are tracked through last names
 
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
slaves didn't have last names
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
so I guess what I'm saying is I agree
 
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
with you and
 
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
and this bill
 
00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
I like you thought initially
 
00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
we may not we may not need this because
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
from my research in current law and
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
sitting with OLS
 
00:32:45.409 --> 00:32:45.419 align:start position:0%
asking them to help me fix this bill
 
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
they informed me
 
00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
and in reviewing the testimony I thought
 
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
why do we need this bill because it
 
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
appears that current statute
 
00:32:59.149 --> 00:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
calls for the treatment of remains
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
respectfully of all Origins regardless
 
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:04.140 align:start position:0%
of origins or circumstances of
 
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:05.820 align:start position:0%
discovering it
 
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
or what have you but because I had
 
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:10.860 align:start position:0%
similar feelings that the you just
 
00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:11.990 align:start position:0%
similar feelings that the you just
expressed

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
expressed
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
all the the same feelings that there's
 
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
absolutely no harm and certainly some
 
00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:18.539 align:start position:0%
good done
 
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
by codifying and calling out
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
certain groups as precedent has
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
already been set
 
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
federally and in in New Hampshire
 
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
statute for Native Americans
 
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:37.140 align:start position:0%
so I essentially agree with you but I
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
also think that we we agreed in the
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
beginning that
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
it it may or may not be necessary but
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
it's not a bad not a bad idea and
 
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
there's some sentiment I think
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
in parts of the legislature
 
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.850 align:start position:0%
in parts of the legislature
that

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:52.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
in general
 
00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
cultural Racial equality is a good thing
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
isn't always a good thing unless there's
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
some justification to do that like there
 
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:08.700 align:start position:0%
clearly was for Native Americans and may
 
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
clearly be for African Americans in this
 
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
during that you know in this case
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
in this case so I think that's we're
 
00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
just trying to hammer out how exactly we
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
do that where to put it in law
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
and maybe in some people's minds and I'm
 
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:26.220 align:start position:0%
not speaking I can't speak for other
 
00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
people really
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
if we do that but I I think there's
 
00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:33.419 align:start position:0%
enough consensus to do something is just
 
00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:37.379 align:start position:0%
to do exactly how to do it we've seen
 
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
well at least one option in my amendment
 
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen the official versions
 
00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
from OLS I did see the Google Doc
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
version from representative Darby
 
00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:46.070 align:start position:0%
version from representative Darby
um

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
but I'm representative do you have the
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
OLS versions that you can circulate
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
around they I have one they were only
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
they were only produced today at I'm
 
00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:01.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
they were only delivered today at 8 52
 
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
and then there was a printer malfunction
 
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
so okay here's here's one well we will
 
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
we'll still be here for another three or
 
00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative wolf before we start
 
00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:22.940 align:start position:0%
passing out duck oh too late well
 
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just resolve what you just
 
00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
said Mr McHugh representative McHugh if
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
we're on an agreement that it should be
 
00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:38.990 align:start position:0%
we're on an agreement that it should be
pardon

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
I'd like to resolve what you have just
 
00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:46.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
goodness in in the last Representatives
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
comments can we work on those before we
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
start going through these three
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
amendments I didn't get them last night
 
00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen any of these amendments I
 
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
got a notice at three o'clock that the
 
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
executive session was canceled and I was
 
00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
not real happy with that so I think we
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
ought to start to proceed and see
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
whether there's a general agreement that
 
00:36:16.849 --> 00:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
we are going to proceed
 
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
and then we'll take
 
00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
representative Darby so we can take
 
00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
yours I I don't know what they all are
 
00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
you want to say something yeah look
 
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead yeah I didn't I didn't
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
know you later on to say so
 
00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
um even without looking at
 
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative Darby's Amendment
 
00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:43.740 align:start position:0%
if we're having a general discussion
 
00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:47.220 align:start position:0%
about as Mr Wolf says where are we going
 
00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
perhaps I'd if if he'll entertain a
 
00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:52.069 align:start position:0%
perhaps I'd if if he'll entertain a
question

00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
what is wrong with Mr McHugh's amendment
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
that takes it and puts it in with the
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
Native Americans but puts it in my
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
memory is last time Mr Dobby was not
 
00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
happy with that Amendment but if if he's
 
00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
able to accept that Amendment without 10
 
00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
other amendments or tell us why you
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
don't like it then maybe as Mr Wolf
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
asked representative wolf asks maybe we
 
00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
could figure out is there any option to
 
00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
make an agreement yeah sure it's it's
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward
 
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:26.810 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward
um

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
there's two there's two pretty
 
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
significant issues with that Amendment
 
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
the first is that it um really
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
co-mingles this language with the nagra
 
00:37:40.329 --> 00:37:40.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.569 --> 00:37:44.579 align:start position:0%
apparently I I can't speak loud sorry
 
00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:47.220 align:start position:0%
um there's really two significant uh
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
errors one is that really co-mingles the
 
00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
language about Native Americans with
 
00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:54.180 align:start position:0%
that modeled after the nagpra law which
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
is based on federal statute
 
00:37:59.690 --> 00:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
um in particular the first section of
 
00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
his Amendment
 
00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:01.810 align:start position:0%
his Amendment
um

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:01.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
is is really just it doesn't fit into
 
00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill and it doesn't
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
fit in with the
 
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
um uh with the the process that's why
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
when the state archaeologist
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
um testified he was very confused
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
because it just the location of that
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
text does not make sense and when I went
 
00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:25.079 align:start position:0%
and talked to OLS because of course I
 
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
did that and I did not say when I talked
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
to OLS I didn't say please draft this
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
for me what I said is here's the
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
sections that
 
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
I see this is how I I don't want to
 
00:38:41.329 --> 00:38:41.339 align:start position:0%
I don't believe
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
um that the nagpra related statute
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
should be modified
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
um because there's traceability so
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
there's that one section
 
00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
but the other section and the much much
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
more important section
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
is the original Bill had a new
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
um chapter called number 289 24. in that
 
00:39:08.569 --> 00:39:08.579 align:start position:0%
in that bill and which is pretty similar
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
to this amendment the um the last
 
00:39:14.089 --> 00:39:14.099 align:start position:0%
paragraph of 289-24
 
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:17.720 align:start position:0%
talked about returning remains and
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
gravesite artifacts that are held in
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
collections that was stripped out of the
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
um of uh representative mchughes excuse
 
00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.870 align:start position:0%
um of uh representative mchughes excuse
me

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:39:32.089 --> 00:39:32.099 align:start position:0%
I just could I interrupt for a minute
 
00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
I'm really distracted
 
00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:36.900 align:start position:0%
by this other conversation going on
 
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
while we're
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
trying to have a hearing together and I
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
find it really discourteous to will that
 
00:39:58.329 --> 00:39:58.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
so so those are the two main problems
 
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
with uh representative McHugh's
 
00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.430 align:start position:0%
with uh representative McHugh's
Amendment

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
um I I agree honestly and the and the
 
00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:10.619 align:start position:0%
amendment that I have here tries to do
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
exactly what representative Amendment
 
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
tries to do which is
 
00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
um which is more appropriately aligned
 
00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
um the the changes intended by the bill
 
00:40:24.829 --> 00:40:24.839 align:start position:0%
with existing statute but note
 
00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
um there are there are multiple um there
 
00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
are multiple cases of you know
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
African-American remains there's
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
African-American remains when you just
 
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
just discover bones that's the cut
 
00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
that's what
 
00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:38.109 align:start position:0%
that's what
um

00:40:38.109 --> 00:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
227 a c uh covers there's
 
00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
um African-American remains where
 
00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
um as Senator Waters has informed us in
 
00:40:49.609 --> 00:40:49.619 align:start position:0%
the past are just outside of the
 
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
cemetery boundaries it's pretty easy to
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
find just with simple Google searches
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to share this research
 
00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
where these cases exist today in
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
um in Southern New Hampshire it's easy
 
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
to find cases where there are believed
 
00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
to be African-American remains that have
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
not been reinterred that are not that
 
00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
are not marked on the edges of
 
00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
graveyards or on private property it is
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
easy to find this just with casual
 
00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.109 align:start position:0%
easy to find this just with casual
research

00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:41:18.119 --> 00:41:18.770 align:start position:0%
research
um

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
so uh so that's the other side of these
 
00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
other sections the other sections are
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
where we have a
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
um an abandoned graveyard
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
um that's uh and then there's the
 
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
sections on returning
 
00:41:34.849 --> 00:41:34.859 align:start position:0%
um you know returning artifacts and in
 
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
particular remains so they can be
 
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
reinterred and that has to be and that
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely has to be accounted for in
 
00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.329 align:start position:0%
absolutely has to be accounted for in
this

00:41:43.329 --> 00:41:43.339 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
in the bill in the um in an amendment if
 
00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:53.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:54.849 --> 00:41:54.859 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
we're doing exactly now
 
00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
what I've been trying to get rid of and
 
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
that is here's mine there it is and okay
 
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
here's mine there it is and
 
00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to move from that
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
what I'm proposing with a subcommittee
 
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
is you get yours you get yours
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
let's see if we can now come into the
 
00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
into the middle or and get something
 
00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
that everybody can agree on do it like
 
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
they do in Congress you want something
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
you want something okay let's now put it
 
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
together and see if we get something
 
00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:44.420 align:start position:0%
not like Congress they do a lot of money
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
but that's what that's what I'm trying
 
00:42:50.089 --> 00:42:50.099 align:start position:0%
to propose with a subcommittee is to be
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
able to make a compromise bill
 
00:42:58.930 --> 00:42:58.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
away and put I want to get a win-win
 
00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.130 align:start position:0%
away and put I want to get a win-win
situation

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm proposing I know that's
 
00:43:13.849 --> 00:43:13.859 align:start position:0%
asking a lot in the political
 
00:43:13.859 --> 00:43:15.170 align:start position:0%
asking a lot in the political
environment

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:15.180 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:43:17.809 --> 00:43:17.819 align:start position:0%
and the only way I've ever seen it done
 
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
is when people will you know be willing
 
00:43:22.849 --> 00:43:22.859 align:start position:0%
to compromise
 
00:43:22.859 --> 00:43:24.170 align:start position:0%
to compromise
uh

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:24.180 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
if we can't do it then let me know and
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
then we'll just stay here and fight for
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.589 align:start position:0%
 
laughs

00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
laughs
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that I have a position
 
00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
on whether there should be a
 
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or not um but I do just
 
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
we're talking about something that's
 
00:43:50.329 --> 00:43:50.339 align:start position:0%
really sensitive and we're trying to
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
focus on the importance of in part of
 
00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:54.770 align:start position:0%
focus on the importance of in part of
having

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
um consultation and conversation with
 
00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:00.500 align:start position:0%
descendant communities of
 
00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
African-American people who have passed
 
00:44:05.329 --> 00:44:05.339 align:start position:0%
and been buried
 
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:08.220 align:start position:0%
and I just want to recognize that
 
00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:08.870 align:start position:0%
and I just want to recognize that
um

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
we unfortunately don't have any of those
 
00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
Folks at the table right now and so I
 
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
think I just want to be really sensitive
 
00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:16.790 align:start position:0%
think I just want to be really sensitive
that

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:17.569 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:44:17.569 --> 00:44:17.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit different than
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
um the average conversation that we're
 
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
going to have in the house and that I'm
 
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure what winning looks like
 
00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
so I'm just really sensitive that uh
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
however we move forward
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
um that we can Center the people and the
 
00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
souls and their descendants of the folks
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
who that were who were talking about
 
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:48.069 align:start position:0%
who that were who were talking about
thing

00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
you asked for both
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
who has not no no she has spoke spoken I
 
00:45:02.089 --> 00:45:02.099 align:start position:0%
just want to make certain I get the rest
 
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
it was just brought up there are no
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
African African Americans in this
 
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:18.770 align:start position:0%
African African Americans in this
committee

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
I think that is one of the issues we're
 
00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:45:26.329 --> 00:45:26.339 align:start position:0%
I think that the afro-americ
 
00:45:29.329 --> 00:45:29.339 align:start position:0%
African-American Community back and I'm
 
00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
not saying now I'm saying back then were
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
afforded no dignity and I think that the
 
00:45:38.089 --> 00:45:38.099 align:start position:0%
fact that we're diddling around with
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
this rather than getting something
 
00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
passed means they've already waited
 
00:45:44.089 --> 00:45:44.099 align:start position:0%
hundreds of years
 
00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:46.380 align:start position:0%
for that dignity and we should provide
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
it for them that's what I think
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
so you're not you're not into giving oh
 
00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
oh forget it there isn't if I'm not
 
00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.910 align:start position:0%
oh forget it there isn't if I'm not
mistaken

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
mistaken
 
00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.170 align:start position:0%
mistaken
uh

00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:59.030 align:start position:0%
uh
senator

00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
uh you have uh mentioned that you have a
 
00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:06.540 align:start position:0%
some background and uh
 
00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
some of your heritage is uh
 
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.930 align:start position:0%
some of your heritage is uh
African-American

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
okay if you've I think you've said that
 
00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:19.220 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
and I know and I know your District Four
 
00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:25.140 align:start position:0%
so I wasn't quite here I I remember the
 
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire on
 
00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
board of directors and uh have worked
 
00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.609 align:start position:0%
board of directors and uh have worked
extensively

00:46:31.609 --> 00:46:31.619 align:start position:0%
extensively
 
00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
um with the black Heritage Trail of I
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
mean New Hampshire on on you know and
 
00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
and uh and descending community on these
 
00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
projects for decades no but I mean I
 
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
think the
 
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
the representative is concerned that
 
00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
there's no one in this uh uh in the on
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
in this committee who has any uh
 
00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
African-American uh uh background you
 
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
know uh you know there were no
 
00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:02.390 align:start position:0%
know uh you know there were no
bloodlines

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
bloodlines
 
00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:05.220 align:start position:0%
uh and uh I think you have
 
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
post-testified that you have
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
um thanks for your question I have an
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
interracial family
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
um myself I I do not to my knowledge
 
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
have African-American descent but I have
 
00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:20.579 align:start position:0%
uh my family is um I know Jesse Waters
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
says he does
 
00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:23.900 align:start position:0%
on television
 
00:47:26.569 --> 00:47:26.579 align:start position:0%
but but no let me just say that I I
 
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
think that the wisdom of this committee
 
00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
to sensitively
 
00:47:32.089 --> 00:47:32.099 align:start position:0%
um understand and learn about
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
um concerns the African American
 
00:47:33.359 --> 00:47:34.550 align:start position:0%
um concerns the African American
Community

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
Community
 
00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
um is what we do as legislators so I
 
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:40.140 align:start position:0%
um you know the sensitivity here is is
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
what we're all about and I think we all
 
00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
share in that so I I appreciate the
 
00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:46.740 align:start position:0%
committee's interest thank you and thank
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
you all right I think uh do you haven't
 
00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:53.300 align:start position:0%
yeah you haven't you haven't spoken
 
00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to say I think we're
 
00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
all very sensitive to what's going on
 
00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:02.220 align:start position:0%
and that's why it's there's so much
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
deliberation but I I was just hoping we
 
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
could get back to the point of it seems
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
like we need to decide if we want to the
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or not well uh isn't that
 
00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
the question if we could get back to
 
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
that well let me let me tell you this
 
00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:23.089 align:start position:0%
that well let me let me tell you this
uh

00:48:23.089 --> 00:48:23.099 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
I can
 
00:48:25.849 --> 00:48:25.859 align:start position:0%
as chair
 
00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:27.180 align:start position:0%
I can just
 
00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
call ASAP for a subcommittee
 
00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:31.670 align:start position:0%
call ASAP for a subcommittee
and

00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
you don't have to participate people
 
00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
don't have to participate but I would
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
hope they would because it would make no
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
no value so that's why I'm putting it to
 
00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.589 align:start position:0%
no value so that's why I'm putting it to
the

00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
to the uh to to the committee
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
so sorry sorry uh follow up um so so do
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
we at this point go around are you
 
00:48:58.849 --> 00:48:58.859 align:start position:0%
asking for a consensus or no what
 
00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
is the next step to to decide making the
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
decision eventually I will probably ask
 
00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:08.700 align:start position:0%
for consensus so I can find at least
 
00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
six to eight people who are willing to
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
put their uh sides
 
00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.430 align:start position:0%
put their uh sides
there

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:49:20.329 --> 00:49:20.339 align:start position:0%
their positions aside and accept yes for
 
00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
an answer
 
00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
and then make work a
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
work out a bill that could be acceptable
 
00:49:30.349 --> 00:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
to everyone if it's not possible then
 
00:49:30.359 --> 00:49:31.990 align:start position:0%
to everyone if it's not possible then
okay

00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:34.609 --> 00:49:34.619 align:start position:0%
and we'll let the we'll let it we'll let
 
00:49:39.849 --> 00:49:39.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:41.569 --> 00:49:41.579 align:start position:0%
representative wolf and then
 
00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
representative rock it seems to me
 
00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
from listening to the discussions that
 
00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
there's a disagreement between
 
00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative McHugh and representative
 
00:49:55.849 --> 00:49:55.859 align:start position:0%
Darby on what would be the best
 
00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment no I don't see well okay
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
that's not what I'm asking for that's
 
00:50:04.089 --> 00:50:04.099 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing on this discussion
 
00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
representative McHugh said he didn't
 
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
care to be on the committee the
 
00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:09.660 align:start position:0%
subcommittee Etc
 
00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:13.140 align:start position:0%
I'm suggesting that representative
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
McHugh representative Darby and two
 
00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
others come together make this committee
 
00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:20.700 align:start position:0%
but they have to be on it they're the
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
ones that are
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
have the sticking points at least in my
 
00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.470 align:start position:0%
have the sticking points at least in my
opinion

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative rock thank you Mr chair
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
this is a work session and I guess I'm
 
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
really frustrated because we're going
 
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
around and around talking we have three
 
00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:40.140 align:start position:0%
amendments we have a lot of work that
 
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
everyone's done I just don't think it's
 
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
worthwhile to prolong this and kick the
 
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
can down the road with having a
 
00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I think we've all come from
 
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
all corners of New Hampshire today on
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers dime to to work on this
 
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
bill let's use now to review the
 
00:50:59.450 --> 00:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
Amendments this isn't about winning this
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
is about finding a bill that can capture
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
and apply dignity to the remains of
 
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
African Americans who are likely
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
enslaved we have three amendments I know
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
that with the testimony we had at the
 
00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
last work session there were flaws in
 
00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:19.220 align:start position:0%
representative Magoo's
 
00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:23.660 align:start position:0%
Amendment which were discussed I mean if
 
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative Darby brought those up
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
um let's start from there let's start
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
from the other amendments and just get
 
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
this thing going I I can't see where a
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee can do anything that we
 
00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:44.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:46.430 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:51.300 align:start position:0%
so I I don't I don't see the flaws
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
um in in discussing it with the drafting
 
00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.670 align:start position:0%
um in in discussing it with the drafting
attorneys

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
they took the
 
00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:01.140 align:start position:0%
they made the recommendations
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
on how to draft
 
00:52:06.049 --> 00:52:06.059 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsors bill
 
00:52:06.059 --> 00:52:07.250 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsors bill
um

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
and uh you know I've discussed with the
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
prime sponsors and repeatedly with OLS
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
the right way to draft
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
this language to accomplish what the
 
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
prime sponsors want
 
00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:21.300 align:start position:0%
including Senator Carson and Senator
 
00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:22.549 align:start position:0%
including Senator Carson and Senator
Waters

00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
Waters
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
who's the Prime uh and Senator avard and
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
some of the other folks and most
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
importantly this bill will get amended
 
00:52:34.569 --> 00:52:34.579 align:start position:0%
so we'll need concurrence last night
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
speaking with um
 
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative Wilhelm who mentioned he
 
00:52:40.609 --> 00:52:40.619 align:start position:0%
might might speak with the
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
representative Simpson on our committee
 
00:52:42.119 --> 00:52:42.970 align:start position:0%
representative Simpson on our committee
here

00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:42.980 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:46.140 align:start position:0%
and Senator Carson who will speak with
 
00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
Senator Pearl who chairs Edna who will
 
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
have to concur with this
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
so nothing gets done without concurrence
 
00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
let's let's be mindful of that that's
 
00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:56.460 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
right so if we want to get this bill
 
00:53:02.569 --> 00:53:02.579 align:start position:0%
done like fully done into law
 
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
we'll need that concurrence
 
00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
right that's what happens after the
 
00:53:08.809 --> 00:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
house passes it assuming the house
 
00:53:10.849 --> 00:53:10.859 align:start position:0%
passes it if we get this bill out of
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
here with a good recommendation
 
00:53:14.329 --> 00:53:14.339 align:start position:0%
hopefully on consent
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
with a strong house position
 
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
that's our best chance to get
 
00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:20.510 align:start position:0%
that's our best chance to get
concurrence

00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
concurrence
 
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
out of Senator Pearl
 
00:53:24.589 --> 00:53:24.599 align:start position:0%
right and I had that discussion last
 
00:53:24.599 --> 00:53:26.089 align:start position:0%
right and I had that discussion last
night

00:53:26.089 --> 00:53:26.099 align:start position:0%
night
 
00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:29.220 align:start position:0%
with with them uh in person
 
00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
so my recommendation to this committee
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
is to take the closest position to the
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
prime sponsors in a a very long list of
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
bipartisan Senate sponsors who have a
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
strong position on this bill and the in
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
our closest position is that first
 
00:53:48.829 --> 00:53:48.839 align:start position:0%
amendment that was drafted not by
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
representative McHugh but by a team of
 
00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
OLS attorneys they review it amongst
 
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
themselves to make sure it's technically
 
00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:57.710 align:start position:0%
themselves to make sure it's technically
accurate

00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
00:53:59.809 --> 00:53:59.819 align:start position:0%
right now we've taken the thoughtful
 
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
language of Senator Waters
 
00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
and put it in the right places
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
and the reason that 2028 date was taken
 
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
out was to make the return of those
 
00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
remains fourth width we all know what
 
00:54:14.089 --> 00:54:14.099 align:start position:0%
fourth width means we also want to make
 
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
this law endure past 2028.
 
00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:21.059 align:start position:0%
right so I don't see other flaws in this
 
00:54:23.569 --> 00:54:23.579 align:start position:0%
and that's not my opinion that's the
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
opinion of a bunch of good legal Minds
 
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
so that's my opinion if you want to get
 
00:54:31.849 --> 00:54:31.859 align:start position:0%
it done that's how we get it done I mean
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
and I mean fully across the Finish Line
 
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
in the statute
 
00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
because there'll be all those other
 
00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
steps that's that's my current opinion
 
00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
representative Ryan and represent
 
00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:49.069 align:start position:0%
representative Ryan and represent
representative

00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:54.589 --> 00:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
I I'm new at this I'm confused
 
00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
I've been an educator for a very long
 
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:02.569 align:start position:0%
I've been an educator for a very long
time

00:55:02.569 --> 00:55:02.579 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:05.180 align:start position:0%
and a social worker we have a problem
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
right I personally feel like we are
 
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
bringing all these other invisible
 
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
people into this problem that are um
 
00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:18.900 align:start position:0%
hearsay or secondhand information and
 
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
we're not addressing the problem the
 
00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:23.180 align:start position:0%
problem is
 
00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:26.460 align:start position:0%
we have a bill
 
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
do we agree on this bill or not we're
 
00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:32.339 align:start position:0%
here to work today I feel like those
 
00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
hard conversations need to happen here
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
um and we need to figure out before we
 
00:55:41.089 --> 00:55:41.099 align:start position:0%
get into the weeds of the amendments
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
what exactly is the problem that we're
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
facing right now
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
deal with that problem and then move
 
00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
forward and decide if we need a
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
committee to resolve it I don't know if
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to make consensus
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
I don't feel like we need the you win I
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
win I I feel like we we haven't gotten
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
to the core and the root of our work and
 
00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:07.740 align:start position:0%
I don't feel like we've done work on
 
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
this committee on this bill and today
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
I'm prepared to stay to have those hard
 
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
conversations to work this bill until
 
00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
it's something that we can agree on or
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
agree to disagree on thank you
 
00:56:28.849 --> 00:56:28.859 align:start position:0%

you know with respect to what uh
 
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
representative McHugh just said maybe we
 
00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
can hear from
 
00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
um the prime sponsor Senator Waters
 
00:56:58.490 --> 00:56:58.500 align:start position:0%

00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:01.559 align:start position:0%

Amendment

00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:07.380 align:start position:0%
well definitely Senator you uh this is a
 
00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
work session so uh just you want to say
 
00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:13.140 align:start position:0%
something this is uh
 
00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:15.300 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty I'm
 
00:57:17.809 --> 00:57:17.819 align:start position:0%
a lot less formal in a work section well
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and you could stay
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
there what yes and don't participate I I
 
00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um I really respect the
 
00:57:31.849 --> 00:57:31.859 align:start position:0%
process in this committee and um and I I
 
00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
as a senator don't want to feel that in
 
00:57:37.309 --> 00:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
any ways that I'm kind of casting
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
opinions on the process that you have
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
because this is a great committee and I
 
00:57:43.849 --> 00:57:43.859 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the Amendments and the
 
00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
work that's been done this and I'm
 
00:57:47.089 --> 00:57:47.099 align:start position:0%
grateful for that
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
um when I look at what representative
 
00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
McGuffin done I think he has found a way
 
00:57:54.049 --> 00:57:54.059 align:start position:0%
to get to the heart of this bill which
 
00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
is just a consultation with the Senate
 
00:57:58.250 --> 00:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
Community to make sure that's happening
 
00:58:01.609 --> 00:58:01.619 align:start position:0%
and then also to make sure that we get
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
materials out of collections that have
 
00:58:06.290 --> 00:58:06.300 align:start position:0%
been there for far too long and to make
 
00:58:07.849 --> 00:58:07.859 align:start position:0%
sure we have a process for that and I
 
00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:10.140 align:start position:0%
think that his version accomplishes that
 
00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:13.380 align:start position:0%
I know there's um kind of one piece that
 
00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
is left out of there that is included in
 
00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative Darby's that people have
 
00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
some care for and I think
 
00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:22.140 align:start position:0%
philosophically I have care for that as
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
well but I think the functionality of
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
the bill is achieved successfully in the
 
00:58:30.049 --> 00:58:30.059 align:start position:0%
version that the representative has
 
00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
brought forward
 
00:58:37.450 --> 00:58:37.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to make a clarification
 
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
which is if we do if we were to end up
 
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
with any sticking points with the Senate
 
00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
we would also have the opportunity of a
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
committee of conference if they were
 
00:58:55.849 --> 00:58:55.859 align:start position:0%
small different disagreements so I just
 
00:58:58.430 --> 00:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to add that to the process
 
00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:01.490 align:start position:0%
wanted to add that to the process
conversation

00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:03.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair may I ask a question of Senator
 
00:59:06.119 --> 00:59:07.549 align:start position:0%
Mr chair may I ask a question of Senator
Waters

00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
Waters
 
00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
um Senator Waters you mentioned there
 
00:59:13.309 --> 00:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
was something a sticking point in uh
 
00:59:15.049 --> 00:59:15.059 align:start position:0%
representative Magoo's amendment that
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
was included in representative Darby's
 
00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:20.700 align:start position:0%
um could you specify what that is
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to say it's a sticking
 
00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
point but I know that there's
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
um and I had in my original bill that uh
 
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:28.740 align:start position:0%
which is in the very end of
 
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
Representative Darby's Amendment
 
00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:31.970 align:start position:0%
Representative Darby's Amendment
um

00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:35.460 align:start position:0%
it's the policy statement basically
 
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:43.549 --> 00:59:43.559 align:start position:0%
that I mean I that's that's the impetus
 
00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
for me but on the other hand it's the
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
effect that counts is The Descendant
 
00:59:49.609 --> 00:59:49.619 align:start position:0%
Community going to be respected and and
 
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
brought in and news remains can be
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
treated respectfully in the version by
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative yes they are
 
00:59:58.690 --> 00:59:58.700 align:start position:0%
um our our archaeological
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
and remains and other other items that
 
01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
are in collection is going to be found
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
and respectfully dealt with
 
01:00:07.309 --> 01:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
um so I I think that's that's that's the
 
01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
that's the heart of the bill and I would
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
add this came out of Senate DNR so it's
 
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
going to come back to enr and I I have a
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
feeling that the Senate will be pleased
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
to see a successful resolution to this
 
01:00:25.930 --> 01:00:25.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh well follow-up um so Senator Waters
 
01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:33.500 align:start position:0%
if that policy statement was added to Mr
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative mague's Amendment would
 
01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:42.289 --> 01:00:42.299 align:start position:0%
um you have my original bill but as I
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
said I I respect the process here I I
 
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
see a consensus here in trying to do
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
something that addresses the two key
 
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
issues so um in some ways the policy
 
01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:53.809 align:start position:0%
issues so um in some ways the policy
statement

01:00:53.809 --> 01:00:53.819 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
is a is a valuable is valuable as a
 
01:00:58.370 --> 01:00:58.380 align:start position:0%
commitment of policy on the back of the
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire but on the other
 
01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:02.700 align:start position:0%
hand the policy if it's enacted also
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
represents that value so I'm not just
 
01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:08.220 align:start position:0%
playing with words I I appreciate the
 
01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
spirit of this committee and the
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
conversation and I respect the way that
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
you feel you can best move forward so I
 
01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:16.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to you know kind of pivot
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
and wiggle away but I I hope you hear me
 
01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
say that I you know I value the result
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay one last question Mr chair
 
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
um and I want to direct this to
 
01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
representative Darby so
 
01:01:32.809 --> 01:01:32.819 align:start position:0%
we have we have representative miku's
 
01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:35.700 align:start position:0%
Amendment the policy statement
 
01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
it it it establishes policy it
 
01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:40.460 align:start position:0%
establishes the position of the state
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
and as it's implemented further down in
 
01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:45.170 align:start position:0%
the bill
um

01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
I forget Mr representative Darby there
 
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:50.460 align:start position:0%
was another issue with
 
01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:51.170 align:start position:0%
was another issue with
um

01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative McHugh's amendment
 
01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
that that may be able to be improved
 
01:01:58.609 --> 01:01:58.619 align:start position:0%
upon can you I know you were you were
 
01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:00.660 align:start position:0%
discussing it when he was having a
 
01:02:02.329 --> 01:02:02.339 align:start position:0%
private conversation with Senator Waters
 
01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
and it was distracting so could you just
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
um just trying to collect my
 
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
I want to phrase this
 
01:02:19.609 --> 01:02:19.619 align:start position:0%
um the the two things that I brought up
 
01:02:21.289 --> 01:02:21.299 align:start position:0%
um was the
 
01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
um co-mingling of the um the uh the
 
01:02:29.289 --> 01:02:29.299 align:start position:0%

collections those are the two
um

01:02:48.289 --> 01:02:48.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:48.299 --> 01:02:49.970 align:start position:0%
um
I

01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:02:52.609 --> 01:02:52.619 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
01:02:54.109 --> 01:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
um representative McHugh's Amendment
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
attempts to address the latter of those
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
two in
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
I don't have the amendment in front of
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
me but it's in the first section it's at
 
01:03:03.289 --> 01:03:03.299 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the first section
 
01:03:03.299 --> 01:03:03.950 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the first section
um

01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.390 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.289 align:start position:0%
the
the

01:03:06.289 --> 01:03:06.299 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:06.299 --> 01:03:09.470 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
that when when I spoke to
 
01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
um when I spoke to OLS and I spoke to
 
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
the same lawyer
 
01:03:20.569 --> 01:03:20.579 align:start position:0%
um that did not come across and this is
 
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
this is really I think an inappropriate
 
01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
place for this statement but
 
01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
um honestly I think that Senator Waters
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
is much closer to the African-American
 
01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
Community than I am
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
um and I think that if he thinks that
 
01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:40.140 align:start position:0%
this meets the intent of his original or
 
01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
it makes good strides towards the intent
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
of his original bill then I would be
 
01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
you have a question all right love home
 
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
love you okay please
 
01:04:02.569 --> 01:04:02.579 align:start position:0%
um thank you for accepting my question
 
01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:05.460 align:start position:0%
I feel like to do this work
 
01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:05.990 align:start position:0%
I feel like to do this work
um

01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
we just received some of this
 
01:04:10.609 --> 01:04:10.619 align:start position:0%
information in front of us is it
 
01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
possible to take both of the documents
 
01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:15.660 align:start position:0%
Side by each and give us three minutes
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
to just read them without interruption
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh yeah a lot of when we go for
 
01:04:23.809 --> 01:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
you have a piece
 
01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
yeah it is and I'll make a choice a
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
decision on that in a second let's I
 
01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:32.579 align:start position:0%
want to go over people who have hands up
 
01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative McHugh thank you Mr
 
01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative brung
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
for bringing up that policy statement
 
01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:40.140 align:start position:0%
issue uh representative Darby brought it
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
up when he first noticed that it was
 
01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.430 align:start position:0%
up when he first noticed that it was
missing

01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
missing
 
01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
um I actually hadn't noticed that it was
 
01:04:48.049 --> 01:04:48.059 align:start position:0%
missing because I didn't request that it
 
01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
be removed so I inquired why that was
 
01:04:54.410 --> 01:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
taken out uh to OLS because like I think
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
like I've mentioned a couple of times
 
01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't my intent to alter
 
01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
the language per se and certainly not
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
um it was just to get it in the right
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
spots in the proper form when I went to
 
01:05:11.289 --> 01:05:11.299 align:start position:0%
OLS the drafting attorney
 
01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
so I went circled back and said where'd
 
01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
that go and the answer was it's removed
 
01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
during chaptering number one
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
number two we don't typically so the the
 
01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
law is the policy statement passing the
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
law is the policy statement the policy
 
01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
statement is essentially Superfluous
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
right it is
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
you can put it there we don't typically
 
01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:37.980 align:start position:0%
do that anymore we have done it in the
 
01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
past there are you can find policy
 
01:05:43.549 --> 01:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
statements in other places in in RSA
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
um it it's unnecessary it does
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
communicate legislative intent
 
01:05:49.799 --> 01:05:50.510 align:start position:0%
communicate legislative intent
um

01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
but the potential problem with doing it
 
01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
here I'm sure you can
 
01:05:58.370 --> 01:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
how it might cause somebody to pull it
 
01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
off consent or make an issue of it down
 
01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
the road somewhere so if we want to get
 
01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
it done
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
01:06:17.329 --> 01:06:17.339 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm theorizing
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
it might make it a better bill
 
01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
to keep it out
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not necessarily opposed to it either
 
01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.029 align:start position:0%
I'm not necessarily opposed to it either
way

01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
but my objective is to get it done
 
01:06:29.039 --> 01:06:30.410 align:start position:0%
but my objective is to get it done
and

01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
so I circled back again I didn't
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
expressly ask that they delete it I did
 
01:06:35.930 --> 01:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
go back and ask why
 
01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
and the reason wasn't take it out to
 
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
help you get it passed but when I
 
01:06:41.809 --> 01:06:41.819 align:start position:0%
thought about it
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
and thought about somebody out of the
 
01:06:48.289 --> 01:06:48.299 align:start position:0%
400 or 424 who might read it
 
01:06:52.370 --> 01:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
specifically and think anyways I'm sure
 
01:06:55.069 --> 01:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
you can make the jump
 
01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
how how it might how it could how it
 
01:06:57.890 --> 01:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
could go
 
01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
especially where often that language
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
gets removed in chaptering anyways
 
01:07:05.569 --> 01:07:05.579 align:start position:0%
because it's not the RSA
 
01:07:08.569 --> 01:07:08.579 align:start position:0%
so that's the that's the language and
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator waters for supporting
 
01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
my draft of your bill and thanks for
 
01:07:15.049 --> 01:07:15.059 align:start position:0%
helping us got to get done
 
01:07:16.849 --> 01:07:16.859 align:start position:0%
representative wolf thank you Mr
 
01:07:16.859 --> 01:07:18.230 align:start position:0%
representative wolf thank you Mr
chairman

01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
I think we've heard from the prime
 
01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:22.069 align:start position:0%
I think we've heard from the prime
sponsor

01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
I said
 
01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
that basically
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
they're accepting of the amendment
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
that you've introduced
 
01:07:35.809 --> 01:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
representative McHugh I think
 
01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
representative Ryan's suggestion for a
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
three to five minute
 
01:07:45.789 --> 01:07:45.799 align:start position:0%
review of the documents makes sense
 
01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
we've gotten it five minutes ago huh I
 
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
know I know I'm just trying to move it
 
01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
forward that's right it makes sense and
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
I suggest we do it and then we come back
 
01:07:58.910 --> 01:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
with a straw vote on this thing we can't
 
01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
accept it today because you didn't call
 
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
for it but if we have a straw vote and
 
01:08:05.569 --> 01:08:05.579 align:start position:0%
we've heard everything around here I
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
haven't heard anything why we don't
 
01:08:10.970 --> 01:08:10.980 align:start position:0%
accept the amendment we having to finish
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
the discussion even on well
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
I agree we should uh take some time to
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
read what
 
01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:23.100 align:start position:0%
what the the actual amendments with the
 
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
original bill in hand but also uh
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
I still have
 
01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
maybe a forlorn hope of being able to
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
populate a
 
01:08:37.729 --> 01:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
uh being able to populate a
 
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
because there are other issues I mean I
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
01:08:47.209 --> 01:08:47.219 align:start position:0%
you know maybe a very
 
01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
I would like to see something that
 
01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
raises all boats that we make the
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
mention of all
 
01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
uh all Races colors Creeds
 
01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:00.179 align:start position:0%
Etc are treated the same
 
01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
and you could also I I believe that
 
01:09:06.249 --> 01:09:06.259 align:start position:0%
there is a special issue a special case
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
concerning African Americans that should
 
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
be addressed but also
 
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
the habits have a situation have a have
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
a bill that specifically also says it
 
01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.789 align:start position:0%
a bill that specifically also says it
recognizes

01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
recognizes
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
the uh all all
 
01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
sanctity of all Graves
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
so that take away the
 
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
the the issue of the political issues
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
that seem to be on the uh to happening
 
01:09:43.849 --> 01:09:43.859 align:start position:0%
in this country right now but at any
 
01:09:43.859 --> 01:09:44.749 align:start position:0%
in this country right now but at any
rate

01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:44.759 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
uh I'll take say 15 minutes to read the
 
01:09:48.839 --> 01:09:50.590 align:start position:0%
uh I'll take say 15 minutes to read the
bill

01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.189 align:start position:0%
bill
say

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:09:57.790 --> 01:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
could I ask the Democrats maybe we can
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
go across the hall bring your papers
 
01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.370 align:start position:0%
go across the hall bring your papers
which

01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:10:07.209 --> 01:10:07.219 align:start position:0%
would you like to caucus
 
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
uh for how long would you lick the
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
caucus whatever you
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
have yeah make it 15 minutes Republicans
 
01:33:02.930 --> 01:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
um after the meeting of our caucus we um
 
01:33:11.689 --> 01:33:11.699 align:start position:0%
we reviewed both amendments and
 
01:33:13.850 --> 01:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
um the amendment 1597 the First
 
01:33:16.970 --> 01:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
Amendment brought to us we think that
 
01:33:20.570 --> 01:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
that fulfills the intent of what we're
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
trying to do here we've heard from the
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor that he's satisfied with
 
01:33:25.679 --> 01:33:26.510 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor that he's satisfied with
it

01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:33:29.450 --> 01:33:29.460 align:start position:0%
the one issue that
 
01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
um the difference between that and the
 
01:33:33.850 --> 01:33:33.860 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment which we received today
 
01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
is regarding the acknowledgment and
 
01:33:41.689 --> 01:33:41.699 align:start position:0%
treatment of unmarked Graves that but
 
01:33:44.209 --> 01:33:44.219 align:start position:0%
just the outer boundary of existing
 
01:33:46.970 --> 01:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
cemeteries and we were wondering if
 
01:33:48.530 --> 01:33:48.540 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment that could
 
01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
accomplish that onto the First Amendment
 
01:34:00.410 --> 01:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I believe that's
 
01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:02.570 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I believe that's
our

01:34:02.570 --> 01:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:34:03.770 --> 01:34:03.780 align:start position:0%
I believe it's already covered in
 
01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
current statute though that's already
 
01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:08.219 align:start position:0%
covered in current statute
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
um well I I'm not quite sure in the the
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
correct chapter it's in involved in and
 
01:34:19.729 --> 01:34:19.739 align:start position:0%
it is and and the distinction of that
 
01:34:22.850 --> 01:34:22.860 align:start position:0%
section and why we are we would like to
 
01:34:25.610 --> 01:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
see that incorporated is that that tends
 
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
to be more of a common practice where
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
African Americans that were likely
 
01:34:32.330 --> 01:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
enslaved or living during times of
 
01:34:34.610 --> 01:34:34.620 align:start position:0%
enslavement their remains were buried
 
01:34:36.890 --> 01:34:36.900 align:start position:0%
outside that was kind of customary then
 
01:34:38.990 --> 01:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
so we want to see that that's
 
01:34:51.050 --> 01:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:54.110 --> 01:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
if I may Mr chairman I I noticed that I
 
01:34:55.729 --> 01:34:55.739 align:start position:0%
think it's a pretty simple fix that you
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
could say burial ground or burial
 
01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
so that that way if there's a formal
 
01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
burial ground with a number of people or
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
delineated as a burial ground but if
 
01:35:08.090 --> 01:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
somebody is just buried randomly out in
 
01:35:09.890 --> 01:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
the field which is what did also happen
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
that that just that is a burial so I
 
01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
would think that representative take a
 
01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
look and see where it says burial site
 
01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
just say or burial bearing ground or
 
01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
burial but that's my I think that's what
 
01:35:25.729 --> 01:35:25.739 align:start position:0%
representative wrong is trying to get at
 
01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
is is that um just so I'm perfectly
 
01:35:31.729 --> 01:35:31.739 align:start position:0%
clear is that
 
01:35:36.649 --> 01:35:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
yes okay so remains from a suspected
 
01:35:42.530 --> 01:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
African-American burial ground
 
01:35:46.010 --> 01:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
comma or burial
 
01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:47.830 align:start position:0%
comma or burial
correct

01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
and and uh and then on line 19 yes
 
01:35:56.209 --> 01:35:56.219 align:start position:0%
burial ground comma or
 
01:35:56.219 --> 01:36:00.550 align:start position:0%
burial ground comma or
burial

01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:02.649 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:36:02.649 --> 01:36:02.659 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
before we get too far with that though
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
I did look up the definition of burial
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
ground and it is I think it covers it it
 
01:36:13.010 --> 01:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
covers it yeah that's what I thought it
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
was in current statue it's codified it
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
already it's very uh it doesn't have to
 
01:36:20.930 --> 01:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
be a formal burial ground but anywhere
 
01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
that a person is buried is a burial
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
ground that's a definition already in
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
statute I can get it to you but I don't
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
have it it was a discussion that I that
 
01:36:32.689 --> 01:36:32.699 align:start position:0%
I had we actually talked about that and
 
01:36:36.169 --> 01:36:36.179 align:start position:0%
access to it and I had a lengthy
 
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
discussion I mean
 
01:36:40.729 --> 01:36:40.739 align:start position:0%
I I think I nearly got it was late on a
 
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
Friday so I nearly got kicked out of the
 
01:36:44.930 --> 01:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
attorney's office because I was laboring
 
01:36:46.729 --> 01:36:46.739 align:start position:0%
this point
 
01:36:48.290 --> 01:36:48.300 align:start position:0%
um anyhow
 
01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:49.010 align:start position:0%
um anyhow
um

01:36:49.010 --> 01:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:52.250 --> 01:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to go back and add those
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
couple of words but I really don't I
 
01:36:56.209 --> 01:36:56.219 align:start position:0%
think I'm going to be going to get
 
01:36:59.450 --> 01:36:59.460 align:start position:0%
pushback and be told that it's redundant
 
01:37:01.010 --> 01:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to get pointed to the
 
01:37:03.169 --> 01:37:03.179 align:start position:0%
definition so what we could do is
 
01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
reference the definition
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
in statute but again I don't if it's not
 
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
already referenced but I don't think
 
01:37:10.850 --> 01:37:10.860 align:start position:0%
it's I know I'm going to be told it's
 
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
not necessary
 
01:37:16.610 --> 01:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm blab
 
01:37:19.010 --> 01:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
representative rung I appreciate your
 
01:37:21.229 --> 01:37:21.239 align:start position:0%
suggestion about further amendments but
 
01:37:23.149 --> 01:37:23.159 align:start position:0%
I don't mind saying that our caucus
 
01:37:25.010 --> 01:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
would like a bunch of the more
 
01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
amendments but um we thought that we
 
01:37:31.370 --> 01:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
could take a straw poll based upon the
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
testimony of the senator and other
 
01:37:37.970 --> 01:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
discussion I heard earlier to see would
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
we support
 
01:37:42.410 --> 01:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
representative McHugh's Amendment as
 
01:37:47.169 --> 01:37:47.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:50.689 --> 01:37:50.699 align:start position:0%
99.9 percent of everything we need to do
 
01:37:54.290 --> 01:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
and it's Ivory Snow and we can move on
 
01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to propose that we take a
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
straw vote so we can move forward and a
 
01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
positive thing that we're all together
 
01:38:04.729 --> 01:38:04.739 align:start position:0%
and maybe even go to consent I'm going
 
01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
to move a straw vote that we accept
 
01:38:10.570 --> 01:38:10.580 align:start position:0%
if we had the vote would we accept
 
01:38:13.490 --> 01:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
representative McHugh's Amendment as
 
01:38:15.770 --> 01:38:15.780 align:start position:0%
written can we take a straw on that and
 
01:38:18.290 --> 01:38:18.300 align:start position:0%
that might get us going with I just want
 
01:38:20.930 --> 01:38:20.940 align:start position:0%
to quote someone a very wise person told
 
01:38:22.850 --> 01:38:22.860 align:start position:0%
me don't allow the perfect to be the
 
01:38:25.970 --> 01:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
enemy of good so I will agree and I will
 
01:38:28.610 --> 01:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
I agree that this does get it without
 
01:38:32.810 --> 01:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
that change 99.9 so I know I will
 
01:38:38.689 --> 01:38:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
yeah all right
 
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh we if you will support
 
01:38:47.870 --> 01:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
the what is the number of that Amendment
 
01:38:54.590 --> 01:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
well they will we support
 
01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
is this a straw poll of one uh
 
01:39:05.090 --> 01:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
you support one five nine seven H the
 
01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
amendment in its in its entirety as as
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
is as proposed proposed
 
01:39:17.870 --> 01:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:26.209 --> 01:39:26.219 align:start position:0%
we have a you know it's unanimous of
 
01:39:26.219 --> 01:39:27.290 align:start position:0%
we have a you know it's unanimous of
those

01:39:27.290 --> 01:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
those in attendance by the way too bad
 
01:39:32.450 --> 01:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
we canceled the executive session Mr
 
01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:34.270 align:start position:0%
we canceled the executive session Mr
chair

01:39:34.270 --> 01:39:34.280 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
yep too bad we didn't agree to this
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
because exactly is there any way we can
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
make a call to the clerk I I know no no
 
01:39:42.430 --> 01:39:42.440 align:start position:0%

checked with the clerk if it were
 
01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:54.129 align:start position:0%
checked with the clerk if it were
possible

01:39:54.129 --> 01:39:54.139 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:39:57.410 --> 01:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
you cannot do it well we'll just have it
 
01:39:59.050 --> 01:39:59.060 align:start position:0%
next week
 
01:40:01.550 --> 01:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
can we put it in the calendar can so
 
01:40:03.410 --> 01:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
it'll be a week from today yeah okay
 
01:40:06.050 --> 01:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
unless you want to have a sonar
 
01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
Bill we all want to come on Monday no I
 
01:40:12.890 --> 01:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
don't think so on Sunday
 
01:40:17.689 --> 01:40:17.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:17.699 --> 01:40:20.330 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:40:20.330 --> 01:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:22.610 --> 01:40:22.620 align:start position:0%
well it's
 
01:40:26.450 --> 01:40:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh I like to eat and then well we have a
 
01:40:28.010 --> 01:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
we have a Hillsborough County Convention
 
01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:30.300 align:start position:0%
during lunch on session day that's right
 
01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
so we can't do it
 
01:40:37.129 --> 01:40:37.139 align:start position:0%
representative Mr chairman if we have a
 
01:40:37.139 --> 01:40:39.050 align:start position:0%
representative Mr chairman if we have a
vote

01:40:39.050 --> 01:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:40:41.810 --> 01:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
earlier in the week well I guess it
 
01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter because it won't go into
 
01:40:45.649 --> 01:40:45.659 align:start position:0%
that to the next calendar that's that's
 
01:40:47.930 --> 01:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
right well the calendar
 
01:40:49.970 --> 01:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
yeah it'll be next week
 
01:40:52.010 --> 01:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
yeah could you
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
would you put it
 
01:40:57.050 --> 01:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
at 45 because if we're all in favor
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have any discussion
 
01:41:00.169 --> 01:41:00.179 align:start position:0%
you're going to open the meeting call
 
01:41:01.610 --> 01:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
the vote and then we leave we could go
 
01:41:03.649 --> 01:41:03.659 align:start position:0%
to session oh that'll be great but it's
 
01:41:07.129 --> 01:41:07.139 align:start position:0%
great if we have a caucus yeah they're
 
01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
representative it won't be on that
 
01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:10.729 align:start position:0%
representative it won't be on that
calendar

01:41:10.729 --> 01:41:10.739 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
01:41:13.790 --> 01:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
if you do it at 8 45 in the morning the
 
01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
calendar is already published
 
01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:17.169 align:start position:0%
calendar is already published
no

01:41:17.169 --> 01:41:17.179 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
this is a fair calendar be out tomorrow
 
01:41:23.290 --> 01:41:23.300 align:start position:0%
you want to do it tomorrow no no no no
 
01:41:27.050 --> 01:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
that be the be the next uh the next
 
01:41:29.090 --> 01:41:29.100 align:start position:0%
session next session
 
01:41:32.510 --> 01:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
the 18th yeah Mr chairman um I would
 
01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
suggest if we have it before session
 
01:41:38.030 --> 01:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
begins it conflicts with caucuses I
 
01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
suggest even though we may be five or
 
01:41:41.930 --> 01:41:41.940 align:start position:0%
ten minutes late to the Hillsborough
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
County uh convention we had to take a
 
01:41:46.490 --> 01:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
quick vote during lunch perhaps we can
 
01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
meet first for 10 minutes because we're
 
01:41:51.890 --> 01:41:51.900 align:start position:0%
only Gathering 20 people rather than the
 
01:41:55.129 --> 01:41:55.139 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough delegation so maybe if we
 
01:41:58.129 --> 01:41:58.139 align:start position:0%
have the vote you know for like 10
 
01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
minutes and then those representatives
 
01:42:01.970 --> 01:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
from Hillsborough County can go on to
 
01:42:07.250 --> 01:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:10.490 --> 01:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
why is it that every time I get
 
01:42:14.330 --> 01:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
talked out of going uh a lot of keeping
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
to the procedure get screwed up so
 
01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
I think the sound we should stick to the
 
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
17th stick to the um
 
01:42:30.109 --> 01:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine 17 nine o'clock uh what
 
01:42:32.930 --> 01:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock or well I usually like
 
01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
maybe noon time about 10. how about 10
 
01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
o'clock no nine o'clock nine o'clock on
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:45.530 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:42:45.530 --> 01:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:42:45.540 --> 01:42:46.669 align:start position:0%
yeah
yes

01:42:46.669 --> 01:42:46.679 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:42:46.679 --> 01:42:47.350 align:start position:0%
yes
um

01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:49.250 --> 01:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:49.260 --> 01:42:50.390 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
I I wanted to say before we check the
 
01:42:55.010 --> 01:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
straw poll that
 
01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:55.790 align:start position:0%
straw poll that
um

01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:58.370 --> 01:42:58.380 align:start position:0%
I felt like we didn't discuss Darby's
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment at all and given that we were
 
01:43:03.370 --> 01:43:03.380 align:start position:0%
all saying we could support
 
01:43:05.570 --> 01:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
McHugh's Amendment
 
01:43:10.250 --> 01:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
that was there not some parts of Darby's
 
01:43:12.770 --> 01:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative Darby I'm sorry
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
um that we couldn't also include in this
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
and could we have any more discussion I
 
01:43:21.050 --> 01:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
feel like we're done we're done we just
 
01:43:22.510 --> 01:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
made the agreement
 
01:43:25.850 --> 01:43:25.860 align:start position:0%
well that yeah but we didn't really have
 
01:43:28.850 --> 01:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
a discussion well technically everything
 
01:43:32.090 --> 01:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
on the table technically this is that
 
01:43:34.850 --> 01:43:34.860 align:start position:0%
amendment is not before the committee
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
this is a work session
 
01:43:40.669 --> 01:43:40.679 align:start position:0%
so it will have to be brought to the
 
01:43:45.530 --> 01:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
committee and then there is the you we
 
01:43:48.649 --> 01:43:48.659 align:start position:0%
have a uh if if someone wishes to there
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
could be a an additional Amendment that
 
01:43:54.169 --> 01:43:54.179 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
you know we we're only ho we're only
 
01:44:00.290 --> 01:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
Bound by our agreement that we made and
 
01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:01.430 align:start position:0%
Bound by our agreement that we made and
that's

01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:44:03.649 --> 01:44:03.659 align:start position:0%
uh well
 
01:44:06.290 --> 01:44:06.300 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's the agreement we made
 
01:44:08.990 --> 01:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh if somebody who's but nothing will
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
stop it can stop anybody from
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
making a following another amendment I
 
01:44:20.090 --> 01:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
would if it got to that I didn't
 
01:44:23.209 --> 01:44:23.219 align:start position:0%
however you're known by your word in
 
01:44:25.129 --> 01:44:25.139 align:start position:0%
this business
 
01:44:28.129 --> 01:44:28.139 align:start position:0%
so I would be I would be careful doing
 
01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
that yeah I I'm not saying I'm going
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
back on I I just felt like the work we
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
were going to do in this session was
 
01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:38.699 align:start position:0%
incomplete before we took that straw
 
01:44:38.699 --> 01:44:40.250 align:start position:0%
incomplete before we took that straw
poll

01:44:40.250 --> 01:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
poll
 
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
it uh representative you might feel in
 
01:44:53.629 --> 01:44:53.639 align:start position:0%
Open Session
 
01:44:56.750 --> 01:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative Darby's bill was not
 
01:44:58.970 --> 01:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
discussed I can guarantee you we
 
01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
discussed it in caucus and I heard
 
01:45:02.810 --> 01:45:02.820 align:start position:0%
representative rang say you discussed it
 
01:45:05.870 --> 01:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
in caucus so with both of us discussing
 
01:45:08.209 --> 01:45:08.219 align:start position:0%
it in caucus and then moving on
 
01:45:10.490 --> 01:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
representative McHugh's bill it really
 
01:45:12.770 --> 01:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
was not applicable that we needed to go
 
01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
back to talk about Darby's Amendment
 
01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
that's why it was not brought up on the
 
01:45:20.570 --> 01:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
floor or the con the convention here
 
01:45:22.970 --> 01:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
but it was definitely discussed in both
 
01:45:25.850 --> 01:45:25.860 align:start position:0%
caucuses so we think it was covered
 
01:45:27.850 --> 01:45:27.860 align:start position:0%
we weren't trying to
 
01:45:30.350 --> 01:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
disrepresentative it was there we
 
01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
discussed it just so you'll know thank
 
01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:33.530 align:start position:0%
