communities I know Manchester uh also uh
 
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
had a raise Grant you know kind of
 
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
simultaneously they were working I would
 
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
have to get with the city itself to uh
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
to understand exactly the logic of of
 
00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:47.819 align:start position:0%
what was submitted and what wasn't sir
 
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:49.860 align:start position:0%

Mechanic Street sideway sideway project
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
is it a sidewalk
 
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
or a sideway and what is a sideway
 
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's an excellent question

00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:15.539 align:start position:0%

okay but it's
 
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
I've never heard of a sideways I haven't
 
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
either okay sir likely a sidewalk all

for long-term supports and services
 
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards is recognized for
 
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
a question uh thank you Mr chair I I
 
00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
I've got a couple questions with your
 
00:09:58.750 --> 00:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
permission I'll come back to you as I go
 
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:01.740 align:start position:0%
uh overall
 
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
um my my general interest in this topic
 
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.650 align:start position:0%
um my my general interest in this topic
is

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
um given that providing support to the
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
infra infant toddler part C program and
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
the reports that are required is
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
important uh I I'm generally in favor of
 
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:23.180 align:start position:0%
getting those reports done on time but
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
I I'm I I want to understand
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
how it is that we can pull money away
 
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
from providers to pay for administrative
 
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
overhead and and that question gets to
 
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:39.899 align:start position:0%
be a little sharper I think when if I
 
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:42.839 align:start position:0%
read the history here correctly this
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
program had the Manpower had three
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
people one of the people retired or went
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
away that job got reclassified moved to
 
00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:55.640 align:start position:0%
a different department in BDS leaving
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
a gap there and and then this attempts
 
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
to re-establish that position that got
 
00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
taken to the BDS so so how is it that
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
it's good for us to take money from
 
00:11:14.569 --> 00:11:14.579 align:start position:0%
providers to build more administrative
 
00:11:14.579 --> 00:11:15.829 align:start position:0%
providers to build more administrative
overhead

00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
overhead
 
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
or thank you for the question
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards um so I think
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
it's important to
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
um just kind of back up a little bit I'm
 
00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
going to answer your question in a
 
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
slightly circulatory way so we work with
 
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
our with our federal providers to have
 
00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:32.519 align:start position:0%
federally approved budgets and our
 
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
department went through the process of
 
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
developing that budget and when they did
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
that they determined that a portion of
 
00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:39.779 align:start position:0%
the funds that we have that we have
 
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:42.660 align:start position:0%
allocated here were not allowable so
 
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
what we're actually doing and you can't
 
00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:45.899 align:start position:0%
see this in the item and and I'll I'll
 
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
take fault for this is we actually have
 
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
another accounting unit 5191 where there
 
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
is a roughly there's a general Federal
 
00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:56.220 align:start position:0%
match and we're going to be the the
 
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
difference that you see here will
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
actually be paid out of that account so
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
here it does appear like there's a net
 
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
reduction in payments to Providers but
 
00:12:06.889 --> 00:12:06.899 align:start position:0%
what's actually happening is in the
 
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
Federal grant budget that we're working
 
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
on with the feds we're actually making
 
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:13.740 align:start position:0%
up that difference so I think I I think
 
00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
you bring up a very astute point that it
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
does appear to be that but because of
 
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
some of the other work that we're doing
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
outside of here which is not part of the
 
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
technical transfer request item you're
 
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
not seeing that here and I'll take fall
 
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
so so I think the summary is we're
 
00:12:30.769 --> 00:12:30.779 align:start position:0%
probably aligned that we don't want to
 
00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
take money from providers to pay for
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
administrative overhead and that and
 
00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
that you've just informed me that this
 
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:39.860 align:start position:0%
this document is incomplete maybe
 
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
so would a tabling motion give you time
 
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
to fix this document
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
well the the the technical request is is
 
00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
accurate it's it's sort of what it so so
 
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
whenever we have a contract for example
 
00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
we may be paying a contract out of this
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
accounting unit or another accounting
 
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
unit or a series of accounting units and
 
00:13:03.769 --> 00:13:03.779 align:start position:0%
and typically that would go before the
 
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
governor and executive Council and so
 
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
they would see you know they'll see
 
00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
those three accounts funding that
 
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
particular effort whereas here sometimes
 
00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
it can be difficult because this
 
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
requested action here is only showing
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
that one component
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
okay so Mr chair you know based on what
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
I have in front of me to to vote on I I
 
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
can't vote in good conscience to take
 
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
money from providers I I I would move to
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh motion to disapprove the item is
 
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
there a second
 
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
I'll second it for discussion okay
 
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
motion by representative Edwards
 
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:47.180 align:start position:0%
seconded by represent leishman to
 
00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:50.519 align:start position:0%
disapprove the item further discussion
 
00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:51.470 align:start position:0%
disapprove the item further discussion
hi

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
hi
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
Senator dalessandro thank you thank you
 
00:13:57.769 --> 00:13:57.779 align:start position:0%
Mr uh I think that the
 
00:13:57.779 --> 00:13:58.970 align:start position:0%
Mr uh I think that the
um

00:13:58.970 --> 00:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:01.009 --> 00:14:01.019 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services has given an
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
explanation as to why
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
the document is as it is and it's
 
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
clearly stated that we're not taking any
 
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.710 align:start position:0%
clearly stated that we're not taking any
money

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
and as a result of of the federal
 
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
situation you had to do it you had to do
 
00:14:17.329 --> 00:14:17.339 align:start position:0%
it this way and you will produce
 
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
documentation for for the question for
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
for the representative that clearly
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
indicates that no money is being taken
 
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
away I I can't see why we should we
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
should not pass this issue and and get
 
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
things moving we have a very clear and
 
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
succinct explanation as to the problem
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
that that was brought forward and I
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
thought the explanation was complete and
 
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
accurate so
 
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
so why and why in essence should we
 
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
should we delay uh this this situation
 
00:14:50.449 --> 00:14:50.459 align:start position:0%
we're not taking any money away which it
 
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
which I think is the key issue if you're
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
not taking any money away you have an
 
00:14:56.689 --> 00:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
explanation and as to what's going on
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
and you'll have further documentation
 
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
given I I think we should proceed
 
00:15:04.009 --> 00:15:04.019 align:start position:0%
forward thank you Mr stupid
 
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards so Mr chair
 
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
um I would like to withdraw my motion to
 
00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:12.899 align:start position:0%
itl if uh if representative alishman
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
will support that and instead move to
 
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.810 align:start position:0%
will support that and instead move to
table

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
I'll certainly support that but I do
 
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
have a question which I guess we can't
 
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
ask if the item is tabled
 
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:26.519 align:start position:0%
you may ask your question no thank you
 
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'm just curious what the
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
infant toddler part C program is
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
sure so I thank you for the question so
 
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
um it is under our family centered and
 
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
early Support Services
 
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:45.660 align:start position:0%
which is an Early Intervention Program
 
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
for children up to the age of three who
 
00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:52.100 align:start position:0%
have a developmental delay and it helps
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
parents being the first teachers of
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
their children
 
00:15:59.090 --> 00:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
to be able to support them in their
 
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
homes with modalities with their
 
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
developmental or perceived developmental
 
00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.449 align:start position:0%
developmental or perceived developmental
delay

00:16:05.449 --> 00:16:05.459 align:start position:0%
delay
 
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
so if I may then so representative
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
Edwards thank you Mr chair so so I think
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
tabling may be an order because of
 
00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
public transparency this document stands
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
on its own and as it stands and reads
 
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
we're taking money from providers to to
 
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
build additional administrative overstay
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
overhead uh and that that overhead
 
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
transfer became uh necessary only
 
00:16:39.889 --> 00:16:39.899 align:start position:0%
because uh Workforce was pulled from
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
this very Division and taken into a
 
00:16:46.249 --> 00:16:46.259 align:start position:0%
different part of the department in BDS
 
00:16:50.329 --> 00:16:50.339 align:start position:0%
and I as this document stands I I don't
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
think this is acceptable as a public
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
record of what we're trying to do and
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
what our priorities are I I recommend
 
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
tabling it so that they can fix this
 
00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.170 align:start position:0%
tabling it so that they can fix this
document

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:11.579 align:start position:0%
I see no second move to proof
 
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
Senator gray moves to prove Senator
 
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:15.900 align:start position:0%

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
seeing Nani ready for the question you
 
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339 align:start position:0%
want to do it by hands or you want to do
 
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
it by voice
 
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
all right let's do a show of hands to
 
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:34.380 align:start position:0%

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
moving on to the next item removed we'll
 
00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
move to tab nine
 
00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
and it is item number two three zero
 
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:54.780 align:start position:0%

representative Edwards is recognized for
 
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
a question uh thank you Mr chair uh
 
00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:19.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr lippman I this looks like a
 
00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:22.980 align:start position:0%
great opportunity we've got 51.5 million
 
00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
apparently of additional fmap Monies to
 
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
to allocate uh so so and in general this
 
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
is this is a great opportunity I I just
 
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
want to understand some mechanics a
 
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
little bit better uh Givens we're so
 
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
late in the fiscal year and that this is
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
currently I understand I understand this
 
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
program right now to be lapsing
 
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious if we already have the
 
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
billing backlog to spend all this money
 
00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
or or or or are there new rates that are
 
00:18:59.930 --> 00:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
going to go into effect and and I and
 
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
very technically if we get a bill
 
00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
in late June that we aren't able to pay
 
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
until the next fiscal year does it go
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
against this money or next year's money
 
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
all great questions uh representative
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
um so in order to make a claim you have
 
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
to incur an expense and that's when we
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
can make the claim so
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
um the way that the claiming works is
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
sort of on a cash basis is when we
 
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.810 align:start position:0%
sort of on a cash basis is when we
submit

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
submit
 
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
um for paid expenses on the part of the
 
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.950 align:start position:0%
um for paid expenses on the part of the
state

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
um what is important that's going on now
 
00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
which I think you're kind of your
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
question touches upon is that the
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
federal matching percentage after March
 
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
31st drops to five percent
 
00:19:45.529 --> 00:19:45.539 align:start position:0%
um through June then it drops July 1st
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
to two and a half percent and after
 
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.130 align:start position:0%
to two and a half percent and after
um

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
after July for excuse me after from
 
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
October 1 to the end of the year it's
 
00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
one and a half percent and so
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
um getting this item through will
 
00:20:00.409 --> 00:20:00.419 align:start position:0%
maximize what is available to be claimed
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
on on what uh claims have been processed
 
00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
so could you hit on the lapsing issue
 
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
and and when a bill becomes obligated
 
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:13.980 align:start position:0%
so it it's on a think about it on a cash
 
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
basis it's when when we the state
 
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
um either pay a capitation payment
 
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
through the mcos or
 
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
um when we pay a FIFA service claim
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
um it's the actual we have to actually
 
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
make the payment to the provider or in
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
the case of the insurer to the insurer
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
before we can actually make the claim
 
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
and then we have payment terms and we we
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
don't pay claims to I mean our our mcos
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
in advance so there is a by necessity a
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:51.529 --> 00:20:51.539 align:start position:0%
Paula I I think I just have to uh the
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
okay so maybe this is a Mr White
 
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
question it I understand this money is
 
00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:00.179 align:start position:0%
currently set up to lapse uh if if it's
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
not spent Am I Wrong is it or is this
 
00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
something we're going to carry in hp2
 
00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:09.179 align:start position:0%
address that one first what what is part
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
of this whole equation as that because
 
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
of the continuous enrollment related to
 
00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
um originally the ffrca and now the
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
Consolidated appropriation act we've had
 
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
to carry about 102 000 people that
 
00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:27.419 align:start position:0%
otherwise would have been
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
um not on the program under normal
 
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:32.039 align:start position:0%
circumstances so what this fmap Edition
 
00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:34.980 align:start position:0%
is allowing us to do is to to cover the
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
cost of those individuals extra if you
 
00:21:42.529 --> 00:21:42.539 align:start position:0%
will and so there if there is a lapse it
 
00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
would be I think a very small lapse
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
because we New Hampshire and I if you're
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
interested I can share a study on it
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
there's a study done by all states in
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
terms of what the expected fmap extra
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
that 6.2 percent would be against what
 
00:21:59.210 --> 00:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
the expected expense of a state in New
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because
 
00:22:03.409 --> 00:22:03.419 align:start position:0%
um where one of the lower fmap States in
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
terms of the base for standard Medicaid
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
50 percent
 
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
um the expectation is that our extra
 
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
fmap was just about like if you would
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
take 100 would be exactly matching we're
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
about 101 percent
 
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
um is what the forecast was in terms of
 
00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:20.930 align:start position:0%
um is what the forecast was in terms of
the

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
um extra money versus the extra cost of
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
covering these 102 000 people
 
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:27.900 align:start position:0%
so Mr White do you want to answer the
 
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
lapse question
 
00:22:33.169 --> 00:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
in the hb2 question are do are we
 
00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
changing the lapsing structure of this
 
00:22:39.049 --> 00:22:39.059 align:start position:0%
in hb2 so in in the current hb2
 
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
um the Medicaid was allowed that we were
 
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
allowed to carry some of the funding
 
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
forward right now we're not projecting a
 
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
significant lapse in Medicaid uh just as
 
00:22:51.289 --> 00:22:51.299 align:start position:0%
Henry alluded to because of the high
 
00:22:53.149 --> 00:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
numbers that we do have on the Medicaid
 
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
rolls so we're not projecting a
 
00:22:57.289 --> 00:22:57.299 align:start position:0%
significant lapse in this area at this
 
00:22:57.299 --> 00:22:58.850 align:start position:0%
significant lapse in this area at this
point

00:22:58.850 --> 00:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
all right uh oh
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
I'll not ask my last question thank you
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald is recognized thank
 
00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:09.620 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman to follow up on
 
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
representative Edward's line of
 
00:23:15.049 --> 00:23:15.059 align:start position:0%
questioning I believe that last fiscal
 
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
year we did lapse as a revenue lapse
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
some of the additional fmap am I hearing
 
00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
use state is the department committing
 
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
that we will not be lapsing
 
00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
this Medicaid money as a revenue lapse
 
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
at the end of June but we'll be spending
 
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
I could maybe take it and then I'll let
 
00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
um so I think when we were last year we
 
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
thought that I think we all thought the
 
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic from a federal response was
 
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
going to end at various times I think
 
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
when the budget was produced we thought
 
00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
it was going to end last October so I
 
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
think part of the carrying the extra
 
00:24:00.049 --> 00:24:00.059 align:start position:0%
money forward really which we were
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
allowed under hp2 is what puts us in a
 
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
position to have enough money to cover
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
through the end of The Continuous
 
00:24:09.169 --> 00:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
enrollment which is March 31st of this
 
00:24:09.179 --> 00:24:14.029 align:start position:0%
enrollment which is March 31st of this
year

00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
pull up so it said yes
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
I I
 
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
based on current projections we're we're
 
00:24:24.409 --> 00:24:24.419 align:start position:0%
not we're not projecting a significant
 
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
lapse I think I think the challenge and
 
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
and Henry has spoken to this a number of
 
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
times is right now you know we're moving
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
we're moving into a phase where
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
disenrollment is about to begin and we
 
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
are expecting to just enroll tens of
 
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
thousands of people in the first month
 
00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
and then in the subsequent months as
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
well we still don't know necessarily how
 
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
many of those individuals are going to
 
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
appeal and if and if many of them appeal
 
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
they then continue to stay on Medicaid
 
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of a that's a big
 
00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.570 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of a that's a big
unknown

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
unknown
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
um right now and Henry can certainly
 
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
speak more too just give you another
 
00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
example that our projections
 
00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:02.039 align:start position:0%
um and November are different than they
 
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
were in December because the new federal
 
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
poverty limits came out and our estimate
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
of how many people would uh lose
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
coverage was affected by 1700 people and
 
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
so I mean it's just it's that kind of
 
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
dynamic that is we no one's had
 
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:19.980 align:start position:0%
experience doing unwinding you know the
 
00:25:21.529 --> 00:25:21.539 align:start position:0%
percentage of population that we're
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
having so I think to to if it went
 
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
perfectly with no right no um unexpected
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
things then then maybe we'll have a
 
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
lapse if it goes with some little
 
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
bumpiness we're going to need that money
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
but that's something we would be able to

right if we decided we didn't want to
lapse

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
lapse
 
00:25:51.169 --> 00:25:51.179 align:start position:0%
this money we would be able to
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
deal with it in tune yes we could
 
00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
certainly include an hb2 provision to
 
00:26:00.049 --> 00:26:00.059 align:start position:0%

Senator gray is recognized for a
 
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you the item talks
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
about State's Financial payroll system
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
and sustainability talks about the
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
existing system being 14 years old and
 
00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:16.820 align:start position:0%
goes on to talk about
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
procure services and a variety of
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
functions and Technical experts to
 
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
ensure and
 
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
don't have any problem with accepting
 
00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:28.340 align:start position:0%
the money I just want to make sure that
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
companies out there get a fair shot if
 
00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:33.299 align:start position:0%
we are going to expend 15 million
 
00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
dollars and would encourage you to
 
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:39.049 align:start position:0%
dollars and would encourage you to
comment

00:27:39.049 --> 00:27:39.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
um so a few things that I wanted to to
 
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
talk about in terms of our system so as
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
the item states that the our current
 
00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
accounting system which includes
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
accounting payroll budgeting Etc
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
um has been in place for a little over
 
00:27:54.769 --> 00:27:54.779 align:start position:0%
14 years and I think as Dennis will talk
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
about that's pretty ancient when it
 
00:27:58.850 --> 00:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
comes to software back when we did that
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
we did a full RFP to procure a new Erp
 
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
system enterprise resource system and
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
that took quite a while to implement and
 
00:28:09.289 --> 00:28:09.299 align:start position:0%
that's the system we've been working
 
00:28:09.299 --> 00:28:10.730 align:start position:0%
that's the system we've been working
with

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
um what we are realizing is that our
 
00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:14.340 align:start position:0%
current vendor will no longer support
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
our version that we're on after April of
 
00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
2026 so we'll be in a situation where
 
00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:22.740 align:start position:0%
we'll have no support to maintain our
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
system with a vendor after that period
 
00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:27.059 align:start position:0%
so we've been looking into what are our
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
three options in order to keep the
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
state's books rolling and payroll and
 
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
budgeting Etc one option would be to do
 
00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:38.220 align:start position:0%
nothing and you know have in-house try
 
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:40.740 align:start position:0%
to manage that system without any vendor
 
00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
support not highly recommended but
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
obviously an option that would be
 
00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
minimal to no cost but not a great
 
00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:49.740 align:start position:0%
product at the end on the Other Extreme
 
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
we could do a completely new RFP and try
 
00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
to re-procure an entire new system and
 
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
the third option being we can upgrade
 
00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
our current vendor to the next version
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
and that's what this proposal is
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
recommending is to upgrade the version
 
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
to the latest version with our current
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
vendor it's a look as it looks a
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of money to do the
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
upgrade but a brand new procurement is
 
00:29:12.649 --> 00:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
going to cost in tune of greater than
 
00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
100 million Idaho just did it they're in
 
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
the process of going live in the next
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
year and Idaho right now is at 102.4
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
million was our estimate for a brand new
 
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
our RFP system sorry a new RFP to incur
 
00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
to procure a new system so that's where
 
00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
this 15 while it's a lot of money our
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation is not to re-procure an
 
00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:35.940 align:start position:0%
entire new system but to do an upgrade
 
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
the Consultants that we use with the
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
project we can you know RFP and look for
 
00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
Consultants to help us implement but as
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
of now we weren't looking to procure a
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
brand new system so I'll pause on that
 
00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
so so a little a little further on that
 
00:29:59.690 --> 00:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
topic um the the
 
00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:01.980 align:start position:0%
um we we did look at at a number of
 
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.289 align:start position:0%
um we we did look at at a number of
different

00:30:03.289 --> 00:30:03.299 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:30:03.299 --> 00:30:04.070 align:start position:0%
different
um

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
numbers that related to a full
 
00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:09.059 align:start position:0%
reprocurement of Erp system it's it's
 
00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
its orders of magnitude more expensive
 
00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:13.980 align:start position:0%
than this path to
 
00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:16.740 align:start position:0%
um you know to have essentially what we
 
00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:19.140 align:start position:0%
already have today so
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
um we thought the best path was to to
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
move forward with the incumbent in four
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
although this this isn't a contract to
 
00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:30.059 align:start position:0%
do that this that would be our plan for
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
that part of it
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
Senator D'Alessandro was recognized for
 
00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:38.820 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr achievement and
 
00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:40.740 align:start position:0%
first of all thanks Sherry thank you for
 
00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:43.740 align:start position:0%
that explanation and uh great great to
 
00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
see both of you if if we do purchase the
 
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
new rev how many revs are in place
 
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
as we as we go forward now you know
 
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
they're constantly revving this stuff up
 
00:30:58.850 --> 00:30:58.860 align:start position:0%
when does that end because as as you
 
00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
said uh they're not going to support it
 
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
so what revs on the street as we as we
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
speak do we do we purchase that rev and
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
who supports that rev going forward well
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
um it's a good question and and I I'm
 
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
glad you asked it because one of the
 
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
changes that we're making as part of
 
00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
this is we're we're adopting
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
um a their what they call their Cloud
 
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
Suite package and what that does is it
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
it shifts the burden of upgrading from
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
us to them over time so essentially it's
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
something we wouldn't be worried about
 
00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
doing anymore ourselves and which is
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
great because when we have to upgrade
 
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
it's very it's a ton of work and it's
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
very disruptive to both administrative
 
00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:44.700 align:start position:0%
services in my department and
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
potentially the the rest of the state if
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
anything goes wrong which you know
 
00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
sometimes does so this this takes that
 
00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
so by making this move and this
 
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
procuring this particular situation
 
00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to be okay
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
yes I think we'll be better off than we
 
00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.210 align:start position:0%
yes I think we'll be better off than we
are

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:08.220 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
um from a stability and a supportability
 
00:32:15.049 --> 00:32:15.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:18.289 --> 00:32:18.299 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the item
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
00:32:23.889 --> 00:32:23.899 align:start position:0%
chair so
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
RIT installed base is enormous and we're
 
00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
seeing this one instance of a an I.T
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
system that needs to be upgraded
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
um I I would think that we generally
 
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:41.820 align:start position:0%
would have update and upgrade contracts
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
in place for all the key components of
 
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
our infrastructure I'm assuming this is
 
00:32:48.889 --> 00:32:48.899 align:start position:0%
really just about making sure it's
 
00:32:51.889 --> 00:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
funded it it leaves me to to worry
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
though about our entire installed base
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
you know is there is there
 
00:33:03.529 --> 00:33:03.539 align:start position:0%
um an undiscussed Bill outstanding of
 
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:05.820 align:start position:0%
what it's going to cost us to upgrade
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
everything over the next four or five
 
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
years is that part of a part of your I.T
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
strategic plan where you can show people
 
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
exactly where this system sits in your
 
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
constellation what its upgrade plan is
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
what its ultimate replacement plan is
 
00:33:24.889 --> 00:33:24.899 align:start position:0%
and all of the siblings around it
 
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
there's there's two parts to the answer
 
00:33:30.049 --> 00:33:30.059 align:start position:0%
to that so I'll hit on both of them one
 
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
is that you know all of the systems have
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know we call an application life
 
00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
cycle and and so that you have to look
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
at every application and and we have
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
over 600 large applications in the
 
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
executive branch of government right now
 
00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.310 align:start position:0%
executive branch of government right now
and

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:48.529 --> 00:33:48.539 align:start position:0%
um some extra large applications which I
 
00:33:51.289 --> 00:33:51.299 align:start position:0%
call this our Erp falls into that extra
 
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
large category the other two extra
 
00:33:54.529 --> 00:33:54.539 align:start position:0%
larges are in in health and human
 
00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
services and I think you're pretty
 
00:33:57.529 --> 00:33:57.539 align:start position:0%
familiar with the life cycle work we're
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
doing there on eligibility and and
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid systems so we do look at that
 
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
for every system we don't always have
 
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
the money to do the right thing but in
 
00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:08.460 align:start position:0%
the case that we do and particularly if
 
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
it gets critical we looked we look to do
 
00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:13.619 align:start position:0%
that so so that is a regular thing we do
 
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
we look at the life cycle we recommend
 
00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
moving to um you know and sometimes
 
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
we're forced to do it right if it's
 
00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
running on a say an infrastructure
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
that's going to be no longer supported
 
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
or something like that that's one factor
 
00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:27.500 align:start position:0%
life cycle the other factor is many
 
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
software vendors are going away from
 
00:34:32.089 --> 00:34:32.099 align:start position:0%
their traditional way of selling and
 
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
Licensing software and in and this is an
 
00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
example of that so rather than having
 
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
these big license deals every once in a
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
while while and then getting 15 or 22
 
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
percent or Seventeen percent maintenance
 
00:34:47.089 --> 00:34:47.099 align:start position:0%
over time what they're doing is they're
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
shifting away from that and going to
 
00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:51.419 align:start position:0%
subscription based and they're often
 
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
doing that in the cloud which is again
 
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
the case here so that this Erp app once
 
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
we complete this transition would be
 
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
sitting in in the cloud rather than in
 
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
my data center at 27 Hazen and that's
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
why that's how they're able to maintain
 
00:35:11.089 --> 00:35:11.099 align:start position:0%
and manage the life cycle of that app on
 
00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:17.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
so what I probably a poorly worded
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
question I'm I'm concerned about the it
 
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
portfolio and how many more of these
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
kind of upgrade bills are outstanding
 
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
that we don't have visibility as a
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
legislature on uh oh well say let's say
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
we have if we have 600 over 600 apps
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
then there are 600 apps that at some
 
00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
and then we look at that all the time we
 
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
see contracts going you know we're we're
 
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
re-procuring um so so each time we have
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
a a cusp this is I would call this a
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
cusp for the Erp system we have to look
 
00:35:58.609 --> 00:35:58.619 align:start position:0%
at it and say all right what's the right
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
thing to do here I'll just give an
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
example of of uh you know uh
 
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
where we look at the app itself and we
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
say what's the best thing to do here we
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
can again do nothing and keep running it
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
or try to support it in-house which
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
generally a bad idea re-procure and in
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
in some cases that may be the right
 
00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:21.660 align:start position:0%
thing because the app itself or the
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
vendor itself doesn't have a go forward
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
and and then the the third option would
 
00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
be to continue with that vendor but use
 
00:36:32.329 --> 00:36:32.339 align:start position:0%
their new product and then typically to
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
to determine that we we would often do
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
an RFI so we have some recent examples
 
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
where we did an RFI discovered that you
 
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
know staying with the incumbent was much
 
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
less expensive than than re fully
 
00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
reprocuring and so we did that so in in
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
a sense it was somewhat competitive but
 
00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
not as competitive as a full
 
00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
re-procurement RFP would be
 
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:55.140 align:start position:0%
so we we're always constantly doing that
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
and yes we will be seeing bills to you
 
00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
know we will see costs continuously as
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
long as we're running I.T systems for uh
 
00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
to address life cycle issues in the
 
00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the item vote for
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%

welcome please identify yourself morning
 
00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman for the record uh Andre
 
00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
briart Deputy Commissioner at hdot
 
00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
and good morning Mr chairman
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
um Mike servertis I'm the director of
 
00:38:58.490 --> 00:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
operations at DOD
 
00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
Senator leishman's recognized for a
 
00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:01.569 align:start position:0%
Senator leishman's recognized for a
question

00:39:01.569 --> 00:39:01.579 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:05.220 align:start position:0%
again you know I guess I better run next
 
00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
time but
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman
 
00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
so uh on page two it mentions the
 
00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
expenditure for salt also reflects an
 
00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
increase in material cost since the
 
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
current budget was developed two years
 
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
ago do you get a bid for your salt like
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
are you able to bid more than a year out
 
00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:26.700 align:start position:0%
or how does that work
 
00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:29.300 align:start position:0%
um it's pretty much bid annually through
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
purchasing property
 
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
so follow-up question I could Mr
 
00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
chairman follow up
 
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
so your request is really only for 2023
 
00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
the budget year it's not for 2022 in
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:46.079 --> 00:39:46.970 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
if I could explain it further according
 
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
to your chart you show that the increase
 
00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
in 2022 was 27.5 and then
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
20 in 23. so I'm assuming the request is
 
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
just for this year not yeah it's for
 
00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
additional materials to take us through
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
this year if you can't bid in advance
 
00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:13.140 align:start position:0%
for right what we we do try to uh we we
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
have various mechanisms and strategies
 
00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
to try to procure the cheapest salt that
 
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
we can we do that uh at various times of
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
the year uh and look for that with those
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
windows of opportunity to fill our sheds
 
00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:29.820 align:start position:0%
in this case the price of salt like so
 
00:40:31.849 --> 00:40:31.859 align:start position:0%
many other materials increase
 
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
significantly uh over over this past
 
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
year okay thanks thank you Mr chairman
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
Senator gray is recognized for question
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
when I got this item I went directly to
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
the LBA and I said why have I got 825
 
00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:53.220 align:start position:0%
000 in benefits and when I look at the
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
top of the item I don't see any salaries
 
00:40:59.690 --> 00:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
I don't see I see current expenses which
 
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
is the salt and then I see leases and
 
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
rents so apparently your books got out
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
of whack at some point and you've now
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
realized that you're going to shorten
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
our employees almost a million dollars
 
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
in benefits yes sir thank you for the
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
question what this is and this is
 
00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.150 align:start position:0%
question what this is and this is
actually

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
um a
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
it's not an optimal process but this is
 
00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
very normal for us to come at this point
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
of the season and make these types of
 
00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
requests the things that are going on
 
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
just big picture
 
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
with regard to Winter maintenance our uh
 
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
the increased price of salt in our high
 
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate those are the two primary
 
00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
things that are going on these transfers
 
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
you see represent uh
 
00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
increase contract rates for Contract
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
Health because we do have a high vacancy
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
rate we have to rely more heavily on our
 
00:41:55.849 --> 00:41:55.859 align:start position:0%
uh on our rental rented vehicles and our
 
00:41:58.370 --> 00:41:58.380 align:start position:0%
rented drivers that that are produced by
 
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
that are provided to us by contractors
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
so that the changes in the budget lines
 
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
you see cover those expenses for looking
 
00:42:09.849 --> 00:42:09.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
what you've told me thank you what
 
00:42:16.609 --> 00:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
you've told me is that if I'm going to
 
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:19.140 align:start position:0%
do more Contracting out
 
00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
then this benefits line should be going
 
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
down not going up because I pay the
 
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
contract price which includes the
 
00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
benefits for their employees and if I'm
 
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
substituting my employees what I expect
 
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
to see when I've got an increase in
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
benefits is an increase in Personnel
 
00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:40.859 align:start position:0%
costs more personality it's over time
 
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
it's overtime sir is what that is so so
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a couple strategies we
 
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
use this year because of our vacancy
 
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
rate one is volunteers from within the
 
00:42:52.609 --> 00:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
department and we got authority to do
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
that also externally to to dot we have a
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
few people that are voluntary who have
 
00:42:59.450 --> 00:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
CDL licenses
 
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
because everybody's pedaling harder
 
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
because everybody's working more to
 
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
cover those vacancies these are the
 
00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
benefits line you see is largely over
 
00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:09.109 align:start position:0%
benefits line you see is largely over
time

00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
to because we have large storms we don't
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
have shifts you know these people when
 
00:43:16.849 --> 00:43:16.859 align:start position:0%
they start plowing they keep plowing
 
00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
for me I will have a further
 
00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
ba on this item because
 
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:27.589 align:start position:0%
ba on this item because
um

00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
you know where I come from uh benefits
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
for overtime are severely reduced from
 
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
the benefits for a full-time employee
 
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:40.740 align:start position:0%
because you don't incur all this these
 
00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
are full-time employees sir and so well
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever you know the full-time
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
rate because if I budgeted full-time
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
rate I should have also budgeted the
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
benefits at that and again I I when I
 
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
get these I do try to understand them so
 
00:43:57.890 --> 00:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
I can answer maybe uh something that
 
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
that may address your question and that
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
is when we calculate these numbers we
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
base it on three-year averages
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
so if you can incorporate the last three
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
years into this budget forecast that we
 
00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:15.380 align:start position:0%
use to come up with our original numbers
 
00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:17.220 align:start position:0%
projecting forward for this winter
 
00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:18.790 align:start position:0%
projecting forward for this winter
season

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
season
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
inflationary effects are much greater
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
than in the earlier part of that
 
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:24.300 align:start position:0%
three-year window
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
so that's that is how we budget and that
 
00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
has been traditionally successful you
 
00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:32.300 align:start position:0%
know in a normal three-year window
 
00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
because uh you know you don't get these
 
00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:38.220 align:start position:0%
huge spikes in inflation in this case we
 
00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
we do
 
00:44:41.329 --> 00:44:41.339 align:start position:0%
and we also have huge spikes and vacancy
 
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
rates so that's that's an aberration in
 
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
this three-year window and that is why
 
00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
you see the amounts that you see that
 
00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
we're requesting to move
 
00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
I'll continue this with Mike after the
 
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
meeting and we'll go from there I'll
 
00:44:59.809 --> 00:44:59.819 align:start position:0%
move the item thank you sir
 
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
Senator gray moves the item senator
 
00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
we'll come back to that Senator bird
 
00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
cell seconds the item
 
00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:08.750 align:start position:0%
cell seconds the item
um

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.650 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
policeman

00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
policeman
 
00:45:15.069 --> 00:45:15.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I guess I'm
 
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
also a little confused or concerned is
 
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
Senator gray is on this matter
 
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.670 align:start position:0%
Senator gray is on this matter
hmm

00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:25.079 align:start position:0%
what are your what do you set aside for
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
a percentage for benefits because if I
 
00:45:29.329 --> 00:45:29.339 align:start position:0%
look at what your
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
putting down for a benefits it doesn't
 
00:45:34.089 --> 00:45:34.099 align:start position:0%
really correlate with an increase in
 
00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
your payroll line because that should be
 
00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
for the overtime but you're showing a
 
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
benefit line of an increase of 825 000
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
which seems excessive based on what
 
00:45:53.809 --> 00:45:53.819 align:start position:0%
you're asking for increased per pay or
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
as you try as you explained
 
00:45:57.359 --> 00:45:58.790 align:start position:0%
as you try as you explained
um

00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
if you look at on page two winter
 
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
maintenance it says increased expense is
 
00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
a million dollars so I assume maybe
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
that's your payroll
 
00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
but a corresponding benefit of 825 it
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
just doesn't line up for me
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
yes sir again the best way I could
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
explain this is that our volunteers so
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
the volunteer employees that are filling
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
the gap for winter maintenance are for
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
the most part already full-time
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
employees we're not adding employees to
 
00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
so as a result you know we already have
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
them on our payroll what you're seeing
 
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
which normally would be reflected in the
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
overtime line
 
00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I can what we can do is go back and
 
00:46:56.329 --> 00:46:56.339 align:start position:0%
get you a more detailed answer if you'd
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
like that answer sir that's that's the
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh and again this is prospective not
 
00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.410 align:start position:0%
uh and again this is prospective not
retrospective

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
retrospective
 
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
so these uh moving these numbers gets us
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
could these be bonuses to the drivers
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't go into overtime or salary
 
00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
would have to go into benefit or
 
00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
something the well it does in part
 
00:47:26.089 --> 00:47:26.099 align:start position:0%
reflect the enhancement that the uh the
 
00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:28.140 align:start position:0%
winner folks are receiving in the
 
00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:31.079 align:start position:0%
benefits applied to that but I I'm not
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
they don't really get bonuses you know
 
00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
that those are kind of already
 
00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:36.380 align:start position:0%
calculated in there the winner
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
maintainers get a stipend
 
00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
um those are the ones that are DOT
 
00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
employees and then they have the
 
00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:46.140 align:start position:0%
enhancement that got us up from about 40
 
00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
volunteers up to 90 but
 
00:47:50.809 --> 00:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
um well in the past in Winter
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance we see big increases both in
 
00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:56.339 align:start position:0%
in overtime
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
and then pay and then then it would go
 
00:48:01.849 --> 00:48:01.859 align:start position:0%
to benefits as the pay increase but this
 
00:48:05.329 --> 00:48:05.339 align:start position:0%
is an unusual place to put benefits at a
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
big increase without increasing I do see
 
00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:10.260 align:start position:0%

00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:12.540 align:start position:0%

00:52:23.809 --> 00:52:23.819 align:start position:0%
um it's my pleasure to be here again
 
00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:25.740 align:start position:0%
um uh usually one of the highlights of
 
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
my year to come to present to the
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
college saving plan which again I come
 
00:52:31.069 --> 00:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
bearing good news
 
00:52:32.809 --> 00:52:32.819 align:start position:0%
um so I do we did provide a handout in
 
00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:35.460 align:start position:0%
advance I won't do Page by Page
 
00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
um but we will
 
00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:38.220 align:start position:0%
um I promise
 
00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
um but we will do a quick overview of
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
the results of the audit
 
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
um and Alice even said by way of
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
introduction Declan burn partner in
 
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.130 align:start position:0%
introduction Declan burn partner in
Boston

00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:46.140 align:start position:0%
Boston
 
00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
um so so our materials I would say are
 
00:52:49.609 --> 00:52:49.619 align:start position:0%
pretty standard compared to Prior year
 
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
and the audits were pretty efficient I
 
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
think we we got lucky with no big
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
changes in Accounting Standards this
 
00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
year or financial reporting so we're
 
00:52:59.450 --> 00:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
able to get through the order as
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
efficiently as always with the help of
 
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
our friends at Fidelity who who do the
 
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
books and Records so I'll just highlight
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
on page six actually that's really the
 
00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
executive summary or so sorry page five
 
00:53:12.049 --> 00:53:12.059 align:start position:0%
that's really the executive summary of
 
00:53:13.849 --> 00:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
the audit which really captures captures
 
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
everything we can talk today so in terms
 
00:53:17.809 --> 00:53:17.819 align:start position:0%
of significant changes to the order plan
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
we we start this audit back in back
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
September so we we speak with Monica we
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
work with Fidelity and thankfully no
 
00:53:26.329 --> 00:53:26.339 align:start position:0%
major changes in the execution of the
 
00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
ordered as we went through and they did
 
00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
this fall and I'm getting the audit
 
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
signed off and from a a report was
 
00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
unqualified so as you I did want and
 
00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:37.490 align:start position:0%
unqualified so as you I did want and
expect

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
expect
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
um from a reportable item standpoint we
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
have nothing significant to note no
 
00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
material weaknesses no fraud no
 
00:53:43.559 --> 00:53:45.290 align:start position:0%
material weaknesses no fraud no
non-compliance

00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
non-compliance
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
no uncorrect misstatements or or even
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
errors we found in financial statements
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
that were subsequently corrected by
 
00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
management we do rely significantly on
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
Fidelity as the server provider they
 
00:53:58.130 --> 00:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
have um a good books and Records a
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
system of control which is governed by
 
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh sock ones and and we we spend a lot
 
00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
of time with them making sure they're
 
00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:06.180 align:start position:0%
accounting further transactions the
 
00:54:08.569 --> 00:54:08.579 align:start position:0%
participants balances timely accurately
 
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
and appropriately valued and that really
 
00:54:13.069 --> 00:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
covers the substance of our other work
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
that we we perform and we do have we did
 
00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
have some new portfolios this year which
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
we we delved into uh the stable value
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
portfolios in the the sustainability
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
portfolios we made sure and that the the
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
books and records and the operational
 
00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
processing of of those types of products
 
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
were were in line with our expectations
 
00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:35.700 align:start position:0%
and as designed and and no issues noted
 
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
there so again for that we were
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the system of control
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
around that
 
00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
and then I'll just turn briefly to to
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
page seven as we look at these other
 
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
standard uh required Communications
 
00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
under Professional Standards and again
 
00:54:52.849 --> 00:54:52.859 align:start position:0%
just these are pretty standard areas
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
around fraud and non-compliance again
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
nothing was noted I'd highlight the
 
00:54:59.089 --> 00:54:59.099 align:start position:0%
quality of plans financial statements as
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
one area and we continue to work with
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
Fidelity on the on the the disclosures
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
and presentation and quality of the work
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
they do as they design and implement the
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
financial statements allowing
 
00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:12.300 align:start position:0%
Professional Standards and and all of
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
those we do highlight some of the newer
 
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:16.740 align:start position:0%
disclosures uh as node into portfolios
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
but again everything in line was in our
 
00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
expectations and fed into our own
 
00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
unqualified opinion
 
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
and then or maybe turning to page nine I
 
00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
think that's just reaffirms no matters
 
00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
to know from a difficulty in terms of
 
00:55:31.609 --> 00:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
the execution of the audish and no
 
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
contentious matters uh dialogue was good
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
open uh fruitful about Monica team and
 
00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
as well as Fidelity so overall
 
00:55:41.329 --> 00:55:41.339 align:start position:0%
um we're pretty pleased with these
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
results we're doing the appendix that do
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
provide you know the PWC quality report
 
00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
just an overview of PWC as a firm as as
 
00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
we we take um inequality and our
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the capital markets
 
00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
and indeed you
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
um as it relates to the quality in our
 
00:55:58.849 --> 00:55:58.859 align:start position:0%
audits as well as the standard reports
 
00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
and their Auto report our management
 
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
representation letter and legal letter
 
00:56:04.609 --> 00:56:04.619 align:start position:0%
all of which I would say are pretty
 
00:56:06.349 --> 00:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
standard and of course nothing came back
 
00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:08.220 align:start position:0%
in our legal letter to say there wasn't
 
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
do we need to delve into any legal
 
00:56:12.049 --> 00:56:12.059 align:start position:0%
matters because there are no legal
 
00:56:14.089 --> 00:56:14.099 align:start position:0%
matters at standing in the plan so so
 
00:56:14.099 --> 00:56:15.109 align:start position:0%
matters at standing in the plan so so
overall

00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
overall
 
00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:16.740 align:start position:0%
um you know good results
 
00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
um you know again we thank Monica team
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
and and indeed also thanks Steven as I
 
00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:23.700 align:start position:0%
learned he's retiring today and for his
 
00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
work and um it was great to be here
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
again but uh maybe I'll pause if any
 
00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:31.370 align:start position:0%
again but uh maybe I'll pause if any
questions

00:56:31.370 --> 00:56:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:33.660 align:start position:0%
Senator Dallas thank you very much thank
 
00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
you Mr Achievement First of all uh
 
00:56:38.089 --> 00:56:38.099 align:start position:0%
there's there's nothing more melodious
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
than the tone of your voice
 
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
it's wonderful and I I anticipate this
 
00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:45.980 align:start position:0%
yearly conversation
 
00:56:49.609 --> 00:56:49.619 align:start position:0%
it's very meaningful and and I certainly
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate it appreciate the work that
 
00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
that you do uh this this program
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
has been extremely beneficial to New
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't think there's any
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
question about that and and the fact
 
00:57:03.890 --> 00:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
that it's still an ongoing situation
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
that and that Fidelity has made the
 
00:57:08.329 --> 00:57:08.339 align:start position:0%
kinds of changes that we've suggested at
 
00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
a series of our meetings to enhance the
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
program I think a a well recognize but
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
as I say uh it's the audit presentation
 
00:57:19.849 --> 00:57:19.859 align:start position:0%
that makes it all worthwhile
 
00:57:22.609 --> 00:57:22.619 align:start position:0%
thank you so thank you so much I I truly
 
00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:25.140 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you Mr Champion the
 
00:57:27.069 --> 00:57:27.079 align:start position:0%
highlight of my year
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much Mr chairman I I
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
just want to understand a little bit
 
00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.410 align:start position:0%
just want to understand a little bit
about

00:57:36.410 --> 00:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:57:40.329 --> 00:57:40.339 align:start position:0%
um with the reference on page 12
 
00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:43.740 align:start position:0%
there's a reference that on your audit
 
00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
quality you look into ESG reporting and
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
then as I look at the report itself I'm
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
not seeing actually any section of your
 
00:57:56.049 --> 00:57:56.059 align:start position:0%
audit that dealt with ESG
 
00:57:59.690 --> 00:57:59.700 align:start position:0%
and so so is there an incongruence issue
 
00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:02.220 align:start position:0%
here that I need to understand no no I I
 
00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
our focus on quality is a firm based and
 
00:58:08.329 --> 00:58:08.339 align:start position:0%
as we focus on providing Assurance to
 
00:58:11.569 --> 00:58:11.579 align:start position:0%
ESG into right areas does knock um and
 
00:58:13.609 --> 00:58:13.619 align:start position:0%
so this is a firm level on these audits
 
00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
in particular there's there's no ESG
 
00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
component is purely on the financial
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
statements that we provide an audit
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
opinion and so that there's really no
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
connection between our firm level
 
00:58:26.329 --> 00:58:26.339 align:start position:0%
um and other engagements we might do
 
00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
reports on ESG but not in this instance
 
00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:31.970 align:start position:0%
reports on ESG but not in this instance
follow-up

00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.170 --> 00:58:35.180 align:start position:0%
um is there anything in New Hampshire's
 
00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
guidance or laws uh or at the federal
 
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
level that is pushing you or compelling
 
00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:45.180 align:start position:0%
you to include ESG auditing and in your
 
00:58:48.049 --> 00:58:48.059 align:start position:0%
reports no no not this point in time and
 
00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:49.380 align:start position:0%
there's there's certainly things that
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
the SEC for public companies around
 
00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
certain disclosures that uh registrants
 
00:58:56.329 --> 00:58:56.339 align:start position:0%
are required but in this instance under
 
00:58:58.970 --> 00:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
the framework of the fosby and aicpa
 
00:59:00.589 --> 00:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
which we report on there is nothing
 
00:59:03.049 --> 00:59:03.059 align:start position:0%
pushing us to report anything on ESG and
 
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
then one last follow-up
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
is is I I the little bit of reading I've
 
00:59:12.289 --> 00:59:12.299 align:start position:0%
done on this may be totally biased so
 
00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you your opinion as an
 
00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:16.569 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you your opinion as an
auditor

00:59:16.569 --> 00:59:16.579 align:start position:0%
auditor
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
the reporting I've seen indicates that
 
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
the companies that comply closest with
 
00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
ESG standards or guidelines or
 
00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:26.339 align:start position:0%
principles I guess they're really
 
00:59:26.339 --> 00:59:28.089 align:start position:0%
principles I guess they're really
principles

00:59:28.089 --> 00:59:28.099 align:start position:0%
principles
 
00:59:30.349 --> 00:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
that their rate of return on their
 
00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:32.700 align:start position:0%
Investments tend to actually be lower
 
00:59:35.329 --> 00:59:35.339 align:start position:0%
than the corporations and Investments
 
00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:39.900 align:start position:0%
that do not issue the ESG principles is
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
is that what can you say anything about
 
00:59:46.210 --> 00:59:46.220 align:start position:0%
in general uh the relationship between
 
00:59:50.329 --> 00:59:50.339 align:start position:0%
ESG compliance and race relative rates
 
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:52.740 align:start position:0%
of return yeah it's probably not my area
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
honestly of expertise so I probably
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
can't comment I'm aware of all the the
 
00:59:58.490 --> 00:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
commentary in the in the open in the
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
markets but from from our vantage point
 
01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
is what we what's in front of us and do
 
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
the audits we don't get involved in in
 
01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
those types of um
 
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know areas so I can't really
 
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
speak with authority on that topic if I
 
01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
and I'll just agree I love your voice
 
01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:21.829 align:start position:0%
and I'll just agree I love your voice
but

01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
further from the members
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
like to recognize uh Madam Treasurer any
 
01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:30.589 align:start position:0%
like to recognize uh Madam Treasurer any
comments

01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
it's a terror members of the committee
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
for the record State treasure Monica
 
01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
mazzapelli uh and again this is also a
 
01:00:39.049 --> 01:00:39.059 align:start position:0%
time when I get to just share the good
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
news uh with with all of you and want to
 
01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
thank Mr Smith and Mr Baron for for
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
their work
 
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
um certainly
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
um this there's a lot of work involved
 
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
to audit all these funds and this
 
01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
portfolios uh but you know we've had PWC
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
for for a few years so they know
 
01:00:58.190 --> 01:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
um and they've always done a very
 
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
efficient and good quality work so we're
 
01:01:03.049 --> 01:01:03.059 align:start position:0%
very thankful for that and the same for
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
our program manager Fidelity Investments
 
01:01:06.349 --> 01:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
obviously they're the ones that put the
 
01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
financial statements together and they
 
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
maintain the controls in order to have a
 
01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:13.140 align:start position:0%
clean opinion so we're grateful for that
 
01:01:15.049 --> 01:01:15.059 align:start position:0%
um so it's all good news a clean opinion
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm always happy to be here to share
 
01:01:20.089 --> 01:01:20.099 align:start position:0%
that so um and just to add to to the
 
01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
good news um you know again this
 
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
continues to be a very successful
 
01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.349 align:start position:0%
continues to be a very successful
program

01:01:24.349 --> 01:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
um in the country is still the large the
 
01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
fourth largest plan in the country with
 
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
about 21 billion dollars under ass and
 
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
under assets under management
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
um so this year the the plan had a
 
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
little bit of rough year just like
 
01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
everyone else but in US is on its way uh
 
01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
to full recovery so again all good news
 
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
we have about 800 000 participant
 
01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.190 align:start position:0%
we have about 800 000 participant
accounts

01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
um and again our goal is to continue
 
01:01:53.329 --> 01:01:53.339 align:start position:0%
growing this plan to to benefit New
 
01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire families and families around
 
01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
the country that want to participate in
 
01:01:59.690 --> 01:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
this plan and as you all know we we
 
01:02:02.809 --> 01:02:02.819 align:start position:0%
benefit from a revenue share that we
 
01:02:05.569 --> 01:02:05.579 align:start position:0%
obtain from from this plan and
 
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
um in fiscal year 22 we received about
 
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
19 million dollars and we were able to
 
01:02:12.589 --> 01:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
distribute those funds and scholarships
 
01:02:12.599 --> 01:02:13.789 align:start position:0%
distribute those funds and scholarships
so

01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
um do we help New Hampshire families and
 
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:19.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students we provided about
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
7 200
 
01:02:24.049 --> 01:02:24.059 align:start position:0%
scholarships that range from one
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
thousand to uh 10 000. so again all good
 
01:02:29.569 --> 01:02:29.579 align:start position:0%
news and I know the commission members
 
01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
of the commission are part of this this
 
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
committee and it's all
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
um thanks to the commission members that
 
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
also in first grade 23 there are plans
 
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
to expand the eligibility to provide
 
01:02:42.349 --> 01:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
more scholarships to New Hampshire
 
01:02:44.569 --> 01:02:44.579 align:start position:0%
students and to provide them a larger
 
01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
award amount so again all good news and
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you all of you for
 
01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
um for your attention and um I'll be
 
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam Treasurer
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
um I think that's worthy of publicity
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
that 19 million dollars I was looking
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
through the unique plan hoping to find
 
01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
it highlighted but I couldn't find it
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
in in what paid you to be highlighted on
 
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
this that that report is with uh
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
Fidelity puts together as really mainly
 
01:03:14.569 --> 01:03:14.579 align:start position:0%
the financial statements
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
um for each of the portfolios so that's
 
01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
that's what that represents so it's all
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
separated except it's separate yes okay
 
01:03:22.849 --> 01:03:22.859 align:start position:0%
that's why I didn't I was looking for a
 
01:03:24.289 --> 01:03:24.299 align:start position:0%
figure like that and didn't see it
 
01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
anywhere we probably have to uh prepare
 
01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
a different publication to highlight you
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
know the the in addition to the annual
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
report or the treasury but for all the
 
01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
additional publication to Highlights
 
01:03:37.549 --> 01:03:37.559 align:start position:0%
those benefits that we have as a result
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
of this successful plan
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edwards for a
 
01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
you madam Treasurer I um I'll ask you
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
the question maybe it would have been
 
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
more appropriate to you anyways are you
 
01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
aware of anything in New Hampshire law
 
01:03:57.010 --> 01:03:57.020 align:start position:0%
or rules uh that either
 
01:04:00.049 --> 01:04:00.059 align:start position:0%
requires our our investments that you
 
01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
manage to adhere or comply with ESG
 
01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
principles or alternatively to avoid the
 
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:08.530 align:start position:0%
principles or alternatively to avoid the
ESG

01:04:08.530 --> 01:04:08.540 align:start position:0%
ESG
 
01:04:11.809 --> 01:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
principles to highlight instead the
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsibility to the investor
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question Mr
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I um I believe
 
01:04:22.730 --> 01:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
there are nothing really that binds us
 
01:04:25.609 --> 01:04:25.619 align:start position:0%
or or the regulation or law that
 
01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
um provides that guidance
 
01:04:31.609 --> 01:04:31.619 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the 529 plan
 
01:04:33.289 --> 01:04:33.299 align:start position:0%
um there is a
 
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
um as Mr burn mentioned there's there is
 
01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
a portfolio with an ESG component fidela
 
01:04:41.809 --> 01:04:41.819 align:start position:0%
introduced that portfolio and and the
 
01:04:44.030 --> 01:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
reason for that is it was more to
 
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
provide an option to participants it's a
 
01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:49.260 align:start position:0%
standalone portfolio
 
01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:49.910 align:start position:0%
standalone portfolio
um

01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
that has that sustainability component
 
01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't it is not well what I
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
understand the the other portfolios that
 
01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
the hbase portfolios or the other
 
01:05:02.569 --> 01:05:02.579 align:start position:0%
Standalone portfolios don't have an EST
 
01:05:04.849 --> 01:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
component this is the only portfolio
 
01:05:07.609 --> 01:05:07.619 align:start position:0%
that provides that option to those
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
investors who are interested in
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
essentially putting their money in in
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
that type of investment so it's more to
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
provide the option in the variety in
 
01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
order to
 
01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:22.380 align:start position:0%
and again this is to
 
01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:24.170 align:start position:0%
and again this is to
um

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
and listening to participants or
 
01:05:29.329 --> 01:05:29.339 align:start position:0%
investors out there in order to grow the
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
plan and be more comprehensive this new
 
01:05:36.289 --> 01:05:36.299 align:start position:0%
portfolio was was was added in terms of
 
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
the composition of that portfolio I
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
believe I have to get back to you but if
 
01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
I recall correctly because I don't have
 
01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
that detail here but I believe it's a
 
01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:48.260 align:start position:0%
it's a mix of us about 70 percent equity
 
01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
and 30 percent
 
01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
um Bond a more conservative Investments
 
01:05:56.329 --> 01:05:56.339 align:start position:0%
so the participants should know when
 
01:05:58.730 --> 01:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
they are investing in this type of fund
 
01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
the type of um
 
01:06:03.890 --> 01:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
the type of portfolio or the type of
 
01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
strategy that they're choosing uh to
 
01:06:08.809 --> 01:06:08.819 align:start position:0%
invest their funds so I think it's all
 
01:06:11.089 --> 01:06:11.099 align:start position:0%
this close it's all disclosed and the
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
proper documents
 
01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:14.210 align:start position:0%
proper documents
um

01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
but there's no particular regulation
 
01:06:18.049 --> 01:06:18.059 align:start position:0%
especially in New Hampshire that that
 
01:06:18.059 --> 01:06:18.950 align:start position:0%
especially in New Hampshire that that
um

01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
that will provide that guidance or
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
specific protection if you want to call
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
it it's more
 
01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
um I believe as Mr Burr mentioned that
 
01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:30.059 align:start position:0%
the SEC is trying to issue guidance but
 
01:06:31.789 --> 01:06:31.799 align:start position:0%
there's really nothing right now that
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
any further discussion from the
 
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank you all for your work and this we
 
01:06:47.329 --> 01:06:47.339 align:start position:0%
have already had a motion to adopt and
 
01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
place on file in the usual manner so we
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
don't need that again
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
good to see you all thank you all very
 
01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:55.140 align:start position:0%
much for your fine work
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
next on our agenda would be to pick next
 
01:07:02.809 --> 01:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
month's meeting
 
01:07:05.569 --> 01:07:05.579 align:start position:0%
I think uh Mr Kane and I talked about
 
01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
maybe moving to the fourth Friday
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
because of some of the deadlines that
 
01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
we're working in in the house if that
 
01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't interfere with the schedule for
 
01:07:18.289 --> 01:07:18.299 align:start position:0%
the Senate that would be the 24th for
 
01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
the fourth Friday
 
01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:26.569 --> 01:07:26.579 align:start position:0%
it could take a minute to see what
 
01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:34.140 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald thank you I know that
 
01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services oversight is
 
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
that involves three of you well
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
yeah a bunch of us all right three
 
01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
senators and at least one Houseman all
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
right so that's that's going to keep you
 
01:07:56.039 --> 01:07:57.410 align:start position:0%
right so that's that's going to keep you
busy

01:07:57.410 --> 01:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
busy
 
01:07:59.390 --> 01:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
um how about so if we go back to the
 
01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.970 align:start position:0%
um how about so if we go back to the
17th

01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
17th
 
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
or we could move to the afternoon some
 
01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
people don't like the afternoon
 
01:08:09.049 --> 01:08:09.059 align:start position:0%
is that a problem if we go to the you'd
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
probably be done with your committee by
 
01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.950 align:start position:0%
