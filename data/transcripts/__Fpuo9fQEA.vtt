weeks have been like since his first day
 
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
Tuesday good morning thank you for
 
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
having me uh so my name is Justin lucer
 
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh I've worked in Behavioral Health in
 
00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire for the
 
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
better part of uh 18 years I took a
 
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
quick break to put on a Massachusetts
 
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
for a little bit of a bigger role tenant
 
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
but most of my career has been with uh
 
00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
HCA uh and HCA in New Hampshire so
 
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Hospital uh Parkland Medical
 
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
Center and frisbee Memorial Hospital uh
 
00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
during my time with HCA I oversaw all
 
00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health
 
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
Services uh and HCA had worked very very
 
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
closely with state to increase our
 
00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 align:start position:0%
services inclusive of more involuntary
 
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
beds uh a large expansion of outpatient
 
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
programs and an expansion of inpatient
 
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 align:start position:0%
beds from uh 21 to 71 uh during my 10
 
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.110 align:start position:0%
beds from uh 21 to 71 uh during my 10
years

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 align:start position:0%
there it's very re rewarding to work for
 
00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 align:start position:0%
HCA uh in New Hampshire because they had
 
00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 align:start position:0%
a commitment to expanding Behavioral
 
00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 align:start position:0%
Health Services uh but as I uh got more
 
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
exposure to working with the state uh to
 
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
look at increasing Services uh for
 
00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 align:start position:0%
Behavioral help I found a a passion uh
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
that that's where I sort of wanted to be
 
00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 align:start position:0%
uh and when the Hamstead position opened
 
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
up I felt like that would be a good fit
 
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh to help to continue execute uh
 
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
hamad's mission to become a center of
 
00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 align:start position:0%
excellence for children in the state of
 
00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:08.070 align:start position:0%
excellence for children in the state of
New

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the last two weeks have been
 
00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
uh very busy a lot of meetings over at
 
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
Hamstead meeting a lot of people uh I
 
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
started prior to my first day reaching
 
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
out to the Community Mental Health
 
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
Centers the executive directors to start
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
setting up some meetings uh so really
 
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
the beginning goal is to bring all the
 
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.029 align:start position:0%
the beginning goal is to bring all the
stakeholders

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
together uh to build support for
 
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 align:start position:0%
Hamstead but also to continue uh the
 
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
state's mission to to make Hamstead a
 
00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
safe place to be for
 
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
kids uh I had a a meeting with uh Jeff
 
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
fler at dcyf to kind of discuss and
 
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
build some of those stakeholder
 
00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 align:start position:0%
relationships but day-to-day uh I think
 
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 align:start position:0%
Hamstead is certainly moving in the
 
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
right direction uh Melissa St Seer Who
 
00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
is the interm CEO really started a
 
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
course for Hamstead uh you know to
 
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
function as
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
a moving towards that Center of
 
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
Excellence so safety huddles are in
 
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
place you know we meet every morning
 
00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
with directors and managers to ensure
 
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
any incidents the prior nights uh are
 
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
followed by a root cause analysis if
 
00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 align:start position:0%
there was an incident uh but I believe
 
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 align:start position:0%
that we're really moving in the right
 
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
direction I will say that uh I've been
 
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
to many hospitals in my career um
 
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
and one thing that certainly stands out
 
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh about Hamstead is almost all of the
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
staff all of the staff that I've met so
 
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
far committed uh to the work they do
 
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
there and you don't see that at every
 
00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 align:start position:0%
hospital uh that you go to um but I was
 
00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 align:start position:0%
fortunate to meet with all the
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
department heads over there uh and
 
00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 align:start position:0%
everyone is open to change and to sort
 
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
of executing towards our goal to be able
 
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
to serve uh the Youth of New Hampshire
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
my largest uh one of the issues that's
 
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
most important to me that that uh
 
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120 align:start position:0%
continues to be important to me is
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
decreasing emergency room wait times uh
 
00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:08.919 align:start position:0%
for anyone struggling with Behavioral
 
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
Health I think it's a tragedy Nationwide
 
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
that people have to wait days or weeks
 
00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
to to seek care uh and certainly we are
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
on the move to decrease that for kids uh
 
00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
overall I think uh within the next
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
couple years like to move to a direct
 
00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
admission uh process so we can
 
00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:29.879 align:start position:0%
completely avoid
 
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms within the state and get
 
00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:38.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:40.879 align:start position:0%
immediately you're in an excellent
 
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
neighborhood by the
 
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 align:start position:0%
way yes very beautiful we love our
 
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
neighbors too thank you I'm 300 yards
 
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
south of the
 
00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
facility um question perhaps for the
 
00:07:58.029 --> 00:07:58.039 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh the relationship of um
 
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
the new CEO to the staff that is under
 
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
contract that may be up for Renewal what
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
relationship so Justin and his role as
 
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
CEO oversees all all contracts within
 
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
the facility including that particular
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
contract we have with with wellpath so
 
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
Justin will as intended when we set up
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
the structure represent the state and
 
00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
the state's intended course and vision
 
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
and where we're going and then hold the
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
vendor to that execution of that
 
00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
particular contract and that Vision so
 
00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
he does day-to-day engagement and
 
00:08:38.509 --> 00:08:38.519 align:start position:0%
day-to-day oversight um as well as um
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
trying to create a sense of a culture of
 
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
one team so that we don't have this
 
00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
split of US versus them uh in the
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
facility trying to bring it together as
 
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
one uh Hospital serving uh kids when is
 
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:55.240 align:start position:0%
the current contract up the current
 
00:08:59.310 --> 00:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
contract will be up July one of this
 
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
year uh we had an RFP that is currently
 
00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:05.079 align:start position:0%
still out with responses due in a couple
 
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
of weeks and our team including Justin
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
will be a part of the selection team and
 
00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
reviewing all of the proposals and
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
making a selection so that we can have a
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
transfer happen a transition if there is
 
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:19.240 align:start position:0%
one uh if there's a different vendor
 
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
selected to have a transition take place
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
this summer without mentioning their
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
names uh you've received how many rfps
 
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.509 align:start position:0%
names uh you've received how many rfps
to

00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
date request for proposal I mean bids on
 
00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
the job um yeah because it's an act of
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
procurement I really can't really say I
 
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
can tell you that I've had I have had uh
 
00:09:44.829 --> 00:09:44.839 align:start position:0%
more than three uh vendors in the region
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
Express an interest in bidding but there
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
are bids for it from others than the
 
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
present group don't think I can say that
 
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
yet because I'm an actor procurement
 
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
okay they're not due till February 8th
 
00:10:00.269 --> 00:10:00.279 align:start position:0%
so I don't know who's actually bid yet
 
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Marissa hen thank you Marissa
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
H uh maybe next meeting we can know more
 
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
um Mr Lua um has the number of incidents
 
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
requiring emergency response uh gone
 
00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
down uh
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
recently uh yes so it is not a pattern
 
00:10:23.949 --> 00:10:23.959 align:start position:0%
or Trend yet but we have seen a decrease
 
00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:25.959 align:start position:0%
from quarter to quarter and quarter four
 
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
was the least amount of seclusion and
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
restraint uh issues for children uh and
 
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
and a drop in EMS 911 calls
 
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
substantially um I would like to say
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
that we've done all that work in two
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
weeks uh but that would be naive so we
 
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
are starting on a good Trend uh which
 
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to report out in the future uh
 
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we see this as um not just
 
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
a blank but a real Trend towards uh
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
stability I'm sure the interface between
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
the emergency responders whether they're
 
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
EMTs or uh law enforcement and the staff
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
um the interface there is always
 
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
something that we strive for excellence
 
00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
in yes I think day-to-day patient facing
 
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
staff and EMS responders have a really
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
cordial good working relationship uh
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
we're certainly grateful for those to
 
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
have those resources if an incident
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
arises however part of decreasing those
 
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
incidents is to increase
 
00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:32.519 align:start position:0%
uh you know staff skill uh with you know
 
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
increased training so we have rolled out
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
CPI for all of our an enhanced CPI which
 
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
is seclusion restraint deescalation for
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
patients uh for all staff uh with the
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
eye of like how do we contain the
 
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
patient millu before it gets to an
 
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:53.240 align:start position:0%
incident that occurs I think that's
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
really the the the Crux of maintaining a
 
00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
safe environment is being able to
 
00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.670 align:start position:0%
safe environment is being able to
understand

00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
um the issues that are facing you dayto
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
day and getting in front of them before
 
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
they get to a point of escalation self
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
harm or harm to
 
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:11.720 align:start position:0%
others Senator welcome back thank
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
you welcome
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
to Amstead Mr luer um am I Mis
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
remembering that the RFP was originally
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
issued in the spring and then called
 
00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
back to talk to
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
other kinds of other providers could you
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit
 
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
about maybe there anything you can tell
 
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
us if I'm not
 
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
misremembering sure when we originally
 
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
bought Hamstead we had a expectation
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
that we would have the current vendor in
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
that role that was the sole source Award
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
of that contract uh for that period of
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
time and that we would then go out to
 
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
our P I think what we didn't know then
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
that we did know uh further into it at
 
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
that point of the first procurement is
 
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
that um what we thought in terms of some
 
00:13:11.189 --> 00:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
of the models that were going to be the
 
00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:12.519 align:start position:0%
way that we would want it to work
 
00:13:14.829 --> 00:13:14.839 align:start position:0%
weren't necessarily working so even
 
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
though we issued that RFP um we realized
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
that we had issued it almost prototype
 
00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0%
of what it was before and that it wasn't
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
working and as we all know there's been
 
00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:25.399 align:start position:0%
some things going on so we pulled that
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
back saying what what should the model
 
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
look like based off of what we know in
 
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
order to do that we pulled back and
 
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
engaged some folks that work in
 
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:35.240 align:start position:0%
psychiatric care for adolescence and
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
said you know looking at this model what
 
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
are your thoughts on it what would what
 
00:13:40.509 --> 00:13:40.519 align:start position:0%
are your recom recommendations and
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
advice so we took all of that in and
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
November thank you so she's following
 
00:13:54.509 --> 00:13:54.519 align:start position:0%
that I I just wanted to the people who
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
are standing for the for the people who
 
00:13:59.870 --> 00:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
are really can't sit
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
please come and sit at the end of the
 
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
table you're not required to stand
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
through this whole thing it will you're
 
00:14:07.949 --> 00:14:07.959 align:start position:0%
welcome it will not issue in a
 
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
diminution of your salary to what a
 
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.389 align:start position:0%
diminution of your salary to what a
legislator

00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
meets um Senator I see that as of today
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
on the website there are 11 children
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
waiting an emergency rooms for beds and
 
00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
that Hamstead has 19 beds that are not
 
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
available because of
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
renovation um when is that going to be
 
00:14:39.389 --> 00:14:39.399 align:start position:0%
finished and if they if it was finished
 
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
do you have the staff to operate those
 
00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:44.839 align:start position:0%
beds right
 
00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:47.759 align:start position:0%
now so we have two units that have drop
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
ceilings so essentially the drop
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
ceilings are you know you can push up
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
and sort of get up into the ceiling into
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
the wires not this one but uh that's not
 
00:14:59.949 --> 00:14:59.959 align:start position:0%
an appropriate ceiling for a inpatient
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit unless the ceilings
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
were above 10 ft High which they're not
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
so to redo that and decrease the
 
00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:10.519 align:start position:0%
incidences so just to back up one second
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
so in terms of The Joint Commission you
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
can have drop ceilings as long as
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
they're Clips but kids are a little bit
 
00:15:18.749 --> 00:15:18.759 align:start position:0%
more uh intuitive to know that those
 
00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:20.839 align:start position:0%
clips can come out and be used to harm
 
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
themselves so one of our units so two
 
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
units have those drop ceilings one is
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
almost complete we anticipate that that
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
will be done at
 
00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:31.240 align:start position:0%
project completion uh by the second week
 
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
of February we will then move into which
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
we just had a construction meeting
 
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday an immediate uh move to the
 
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
second unit where the construction will
 
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
start right then I can't give you a date
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
as to when that's completed because what
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
we have asked the contractor is to look
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
at a schedule that that's inclusive of
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
nights and weekends because I think you
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
know to your point we want to be able to
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
create access for everybody and if the
 
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
cost of that um is reasonable to have
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
that done days nights weekends we can
 
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
get that done within two weeks I will
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
say that today we were just talking
 
00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
prior to the meeting starting uh that we
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
are at uh 51 Uh current patients which
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
is the highest that hamet's been in the
 
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
past two years when you look at our
 
00:16:21.069 --> 00:16:21.079 align:start position:0%
available beds on at that hospital right
 
00:16:22.829 --> 00:16:22.839 align:start position:0%
now minus the beds that are capped
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
because the units under construction
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
we're at 93% capacity so industry
 
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
standard on any inpatient mental health
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
unit is typically 80% and that's because
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
of issues like blocked beds gender
 
00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
identity issues uh and we are over that
 
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:43.240 align:start position:0%
right now so again uh not a trend yet uh
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
but hopefully moving towards that Trend
 
00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.309 align:start position:0%
but hopefully moving towards that Trend
can

00:16:46.309 --> 00:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
I thank you if if this two week nights
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
and weekends bed comes in higher than
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
you have funding for does the department
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
with the department
 
00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
consider coming to fiscal and asking to
 
00:17:03.319 --> 00:17:05.789 align:start position:0%
consider coming to fiscal and asking to
transfer

00:17:05.789 --> 00:17:05.799 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
funds uh I'll let the commissioner
 
00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
answer but just as an aside we the
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
project that we looked at right now uh
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
is unbelievably reasonable in terms of
 
00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.079 align:start position:0%
Hospital construction so two
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
units uh having the complete ceiling as
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
a hard toop uh was under I believe
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
$667,000 uh so substantial work so I
 
00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:33.799 align:start position:0%
it's not in my purview to continue to go
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
back to the state and ask for more money
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
but when we look
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
at the discussion that we had in about
 
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
nights and weekends in construction is
 
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
looking at if we can minimize the time
 
00:17:48.029 --> 00:17:48.039 align:start position:0%
that that unit's open does the the cost
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
or the return on that equal the spending
 
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
weekends would you like me to well that
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
confused me a little bit because are we
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
looking at dollars and cents or are we
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
right in terms of our we're not looking
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
at dollars and cents uh you know in
 
00:18:18.909 --> 00:18:18.919 align:start position:0%
terms of the state we're looking at all
 
00:18:20.669 --> 00:18:20.679 align:start position:0%
of our available beds and filling those
 
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
beds to the best of our capacity from a
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
staffing perspective uh there are a
 
00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
couple positions that we'll need to fill
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
those are Le leadership position working
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
leadership positions on each unit uh and
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
I met with we met together yesterday
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
with wellpath to discuss posting
 
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
recruiting for those positions as well
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
um so I apologize for speaking in
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
dollars and sense but looking at sort of
 
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
the revenue uh that that could
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
potentially come in supplementing the
 
00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:53.799 align:start position:0%
additional cost but but that is not the
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
focus of Hamstead is
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
revenue may I add something I mean we
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
would obviously support the facility
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
with whatever uh objective we were
 
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
trying to get to but I do just want to
 
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
point out that the children's weight
 
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
less has has vacillated greatly over the
 
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
last 60 days I mean at one point we were
 
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
almost at zero we're at one and then it
 
00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
shot up and then it goes down so I think
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
you know we see Trends in different
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
times of the year of when services are
 
00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:23.799 align:start position:0%
are um needed more than others but I
 
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
think what Justin you know speaking to
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
increase our capacity so when that does
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
vasil late and it's higher that we're
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
able to take those kids in um and then
 
00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:33.559 align:start position:0%
obviously not have kids stay in longer
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
than they need to but be getting back
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
home or wherever it is that they're
 
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
going to be getting going to
 
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
Weber I'm not trying to put words in
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative Rosen malt's mouth but
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
her questions Senator Senator Senator I
 
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
my mind goes back to Fawn times in the
 
00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.350 align:start position:0%
my mind goes back to Fawn times in the
past

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
um but my her
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
questions sparked some of my own which
 
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
is as a follow-up to what she said you
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned several times with respect to
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
the work being on the nights and
 
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
weekends work and whether that was going
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
to be reasonable in terms of cost so I
 
00:20:19.149 --> 00:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
never really heard an answer to her
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
question about if those costs are higher
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
than you feel that your current funds
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
can absorb are you willing to go to are
 
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
you planning or willing to go to fiscal
 
00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:35.559 align:start position:0%
and ask for more funds or um how is that
 
00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
determination going to be made because
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
it seems to me we've got a bunch of
 
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
things going on there's the the the how
 
00:20:44.909 --> 00:20:44.919 align:start position:0%
fast can we get the construction done
 
00:20:47.549 --> 00:20:47.559 align:start position:0%
issue there's the how fast can we staff
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
it up issue and I think that everybody
 
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
is very grateful that the capacity is
 
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
already trending in the right direction
 
00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
they're just wondering Ways and Means of
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
how we get to getting those last two
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
units open we would explore all ways and
 
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
means to getting that open and come to
 
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal if it required us to do
 
00:21:10.029 --> 00:21:10.039 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
you anyone else representative Merchant
 
00:21:16.269 --> 00:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
thank you m chair and also thank you uh
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
for being
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
here this obviously has been very much
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
on the radar for legislative as well as
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
citizens of New
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire going forward to show that
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
we're making prog ress towards the
 
00:21:30.909 --> 00:21:30.919 align:start position:0%
success of defined
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
success what do you envision as far as
 
00:21:35.149 --> 00:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
providing to this committee reports on
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
the updates if you will on how we're
 
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
doing um I hate to see it 12 months
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
later we had another report but
 
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:45.559 align:start position:0%
periodically I think early stage of the
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
process is help me understand what do
 
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
you envision being reporting frequency
 
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
as well as what should be in the
 
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
report so I think we should both answer
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
that I believe that Justin has um some
 
00:22:01.149 --> 00:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
ideas about how he's going to be
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
reporting out on the quality and
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
improvements that he's making at
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
Hamstead I would just offer here as we
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
do with a lot of our other initiatives
 
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
or programs if you will the frequency
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
you know if we wanted to establish a
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
frequency to have Justin come back and
 
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
share that report we'd be more than
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
happy to do that I'll let him speak to
 
00:22:21.149 --> 00:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
what he's looking at for metrics
 
00:22:24.269 --> 00:22:24.279 align:start position:0%
or sure so what I'm used to looking at
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
metrics in patient Behavioral Health uh
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
some of that isn't there at ham yet but
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
we're putting that in place uh one of
 
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
the things that we're starting with is
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
for every unit typically we have the
 
00:22:36.029 --> 00:22:36.039 align:start position:0%
same structure as any other Behavioral
 
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
Health Hospital which is a a program
 
00:22:41.789 --> 00:22:41.799 align:start position:0%
director and a a nurse manager for each
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
unit uh so we're starting monthly
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
operating reports with each member of
 
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
those leaderships to report on sort of
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
the specifics to each unit uh and then
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
from a hospital overall perspective what
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at is sort of incidents of
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
seclusion restraint incidents of injury
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
average length of stay average daily
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
census uh and then also CMS has um hbips
 
00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:06.799 align:start position:0%
quality measures uh that we're looking
 
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
at as well on top of those things what I
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
really feel are important are both
 
00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.149 align:start position:0%

Engagement uh and patient satisfaction
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
our Employee Engagement survey uh
 
00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
started a week before I came and is set
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
to wrap the third week of February so
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
we're out there sort of pushing
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
employees to take that and to give their
 
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:29.320 align:start position:0%
feedback back on safety and quality
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
concerns as well as working at Hamstead
 
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
uh and then in terms of patient
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
satisfaction our scores are very high uh
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
I just saw the reports yesterday that
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
came out um but I'm not quite sure of
 
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
our end size if that meets uh validity
 
00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:46.919 align:start position:0%
at this point but we're looking at
 
00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
through those things so I think for this
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
committee or any any Committee in terms
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
of transparency for
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
Hamstead we want to have a stable
 
00:23:58.350 --> 00:23:58.360 align:start position:0%
average length of stay that doesn't the
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
the goal National goal for children
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
adolescence is 10 days we'd like to be
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
close to that we do have some
 
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
disposition issues uh for kids who end
 
00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559 align:start position:0%
up waiting a little bit longer but our
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
average daily census any blocked bed
 
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
issues uh things that we would report
 
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
out uh and then I think the overall um
 
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
real measure for Hamstead is looking at
 
00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:22.360 align:start position:0%
the weight list and does it Trend down
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
and how quickly can we get those
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
patients in so we are every day taking a
 
00:24:30.029 --> 00:24:30.039 align:start position:0%
good chunk out of that weight list
 
00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
um during the height of kids in the Eds
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
um when I was at HCA we had about 36
 
00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
kids in our Ed and those were just three
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
EDS across the state uh and now we're
 
00:24:45.549 --> 00:24:45.559 align:start position:0%
trending I think I believe today is
 
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
14 um and it's been last week it was in
 
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
the single digits which is great
 
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
progress for the state but uh certainly
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
not where we want to be which is zero
 
00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.590 align:start position:0%
not where we want to be which is zero
weights

00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
weights
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
that sometime in the next probably uh
 
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
month or so if we could find from you or
 
00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:09.559 align:start position:0%
have from you a list of some of the
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
metrics that you want to measure and
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
then where we are today so as we go
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
forward we can measure progress towards
 
00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:18.799 align:start position:0%
where we started so if you have some
 
00:25:20.389 --> 00:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
metrics in mind which obviously sounds
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
like you do if you can share that with
 
00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
the committee I don't think per se
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
having you come back periodically to but
 
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
if there's a report being provided to us
 
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
in a written format we can follow along
 
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
accordingly if we find something at that
 
00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:34.039 align:start position:0%
point in time we could invite them
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
committee yeah Senator um two questions
 
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
one do you look at the average length of
 
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
stve for children on Medicaid versus
 
00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
Commercial Insurance um or and is it
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
different and the second question is is
 
00:26:02.389 --> 00:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
the prtf open yet and has that helped
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
with your
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
discharges yeah no we don't I don't
 
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
currently look at uh link to stay uh in
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
terms of payer mix um
 
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
about this is don't quote me on this but
 
00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
we're roughly right around 70 80%
 
00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or Medicaid products for kids
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
but we haven't separated a commercial
 
00:26:28.269 --> 00:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
insurance link to STS versus medic stays
 
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
I would imagine if I was uh a betting
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
man that um certainly the Medicaid
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
population would have a larger link to
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
stay than the commercial
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
population but that's a little
 
00:26:43.149 --> 00:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
presumptuous as well and then is the
 
00:26:48.389 --> 00:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
prtf open it is open um I will say that
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know we have some EOC which an
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
environment of care challenges it's a
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
small unit sorry okay I've got a PR TF
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
and I've got a p and I need to know what
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
those are in words so I can write them
 
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
down just ask the AAL
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.590 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%

Facility uh EOC which I apologize is
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
environment of care so that's
 
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
essentially looking at your patient
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
rooms patient space area uh and making
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
sure that's safe thank you very much PF
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
Facility good no may you just built this
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
unit the prtf why would there be safety
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
issues in the rooms there are no safety
 
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
issues in terms of if you walk on the
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
unit is it a psychiatrically safe unit
 
00:27:59.549 --> 00:27:59.559 align:start position:0%
it is uh when you look at the space that
 
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
that unit accompanies it's a smaller
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
unit so it can get a little crowded so
 
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing with patients who
 
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
may be a little bit more vibrant than
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
other patients there isn't a great place
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
to sort of separate those uh patients
 
00:28:17.509 --> 00:28:17.519 align:start position:0%
that being said um off of that unit
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
which is a lot of the living space for
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
those residents they have classrooms
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
they have a family room um we are
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
looking at uh putting in laundry and
 
00:28:29.149 --> 00:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
potentially a kitchen as more
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
experiential so kids can continue to do
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
their own laundry we can teach them how
 
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
to cook and reintegrate them back
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
outside of the residential piece so it
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
is a safe unit and we just want to
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
expand the realm of possibilities for
 
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
kids to move around and have different
 
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:49.039 align:start position:0%
spaces where they can decompress
 
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
throughout the day thank
 
00:28:55.509 --> 00:28:55.519 align:start position:0%
you anyone else okay anything else from
 
00:28:55.519 --> 00:28:56.389 align:start position:0%
you anyone else okay anything else from
the

00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%

00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
you and uh when you get your cards I'd
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
like one too I know there's a gap but
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and okay the chair recognizes
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
Carl ly I am SEI and I will accept
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
correction on that and I'm going to
 
00:29:28.029 --> 00:29:28.039 align:start position:0%
probably do better with
 
00:29:28.039 --> 00:29:30.509 align:start position:0%
probably do better with

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
changes that improve the services for
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
the state's perinatal
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
population New Hampshire has completed
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
the fourth year of a 5-year CDC
 
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
enhancing reviews and surveillance to
 
00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
eliminate maternal mortality which is
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
the eras mm
 
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
Grant um this was awarded from 2019 to
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
2024 uh this past year we have expanded
 
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
committee membership by including people
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
with lived experience and have utilized
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts that are able to
 
00:31:24.629 --> 00:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
provide in-depth information about cases
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
so that the committee can make informed
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
determinations of pregnancy relatedness
 
00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
preventability of the death and create
 
00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:35.800 align:start position:0%
um concise
 
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.870 align:start position:0%
um concise

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations thank you Carol for that
 
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
introduction so good morning I'm
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
Caroline yamas I'm the maternal and
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
child health epidemiologist at the
 
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
um at the maternal and child health
 
00:31:54.909 --> 00:31:54.919 align:start position:0%
section Bureau of family health and
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
nutrition division of Public Health
 
00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
services so i' like to start with um
 
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
just trying to let you know that we use
 
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
the identifying information on the New
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire death certificate and birth
 
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
certificate records to identify maternal
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
deaths in New Hampshire the number of
 
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
deaths recorded each year has remained
 
00:32:20.669 --> 00:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
consistent and so has the main leading
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
cause of death in calendar year 2022
 
00:32:27.149 --> 00:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
there were eight maternal deaths five of
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
which died from substance use
 
00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.149 align:start position:0%
which died from substance use

00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
overdose so due to small numbers we
 
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
aggregated 5 years data that is from
 
00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:41.559 align:start position:0%
2018 to 2022 to understand data Trends
 
00:32:43.389 --> 00:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
and determine various maternal
 
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
characteristics associated with these
 
00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
Debs about 53% of all pregnancy related
 
00:32:53.789 --> 00:32:53.799 align:start position:0%
debts that occurred in the past 5 years
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
were caused by substance use overdose
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
opioids was was the leading cause
 
00:33:00.909 --> 00:33:00.919 align:start position:0%
followed by cocaine and other
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
substances uh the second leading cause
 
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
of maternal deaths in New Hampshire is
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular related deaths such as
 
00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
congestive heart failure hypertensive
 
00:33:13.389 --> 00:33:13.399 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular disease cardiac arthia
 
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
and coronary heart diseases so most of
 
00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
the deaths that occurred among women
 
00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
aged 25 to 34 years old and about half
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
of the disident had acquired a high
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
school diploma or
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
so the mmrc committee determined that um
 
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
mental health condition were the leading
 
00:33:36.909 --> 00:33:36.919 align:start position:0%
circumstances surrounding the overdose
 
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
deaths other social stresses present
 
00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
were history of substance use treatment
 
00:33:45.549 --> 00:33:45.559 align:start position:0%
psychiatric hospitalization or treatment
 
00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
history of childhood trauma involvement
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
of child protective services and
 
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
unemployment so first we want to
 
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledge you all um for expanding
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
Medicaid in our state uh through one
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
year postpartum which we hope will
 
00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
increase Behavioral Health Services
 
00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
utilization since most overdose deaths
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
occurred postpartum that is 3 to to one
 
00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
year and
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
56.5% of postpartum debts had their
 
00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
delivery paid by
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid this has been an early
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the mmrc and one that
 
00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
has come up several
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
times lastly we've been working with the
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
division vital records and medical
 
00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
examiner office to improve data quality
 
00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
by ensuring the pregnancy check box
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
which which is on the death certificate
 
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
is failed there are circumstances
 
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
whereby we find null or unknown fails
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
and this will increase identification of
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
deaths occurring during pregnancy it's
 
00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
impossible to identify women who are
 
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
pregnant but lost their pregnancy
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
earlier into into pregnancy except using
 
00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
the pregnancy checkbox on the death
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
certificate therefore it is important
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
for the de certifier to verify history
 
00:35:02.589 --> 00:35:02.599 align:start position:0%
of pregnancy by checking medical records
 
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
asking a family
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
member or a death informant when filling
 
00:35:09.069 --> 00:35:09.079 align:start position:0%
the death
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
certificate uh this was also another MMC
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation I'll pass it to my
 
00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.430 align:start position:0%
recommendation I'll pass it to my
colleague

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
Carol so um due to the nature of
 
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
maternal deaths occurring in New
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh work does continue on the
 
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire m RC recommendations that
 
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
improve the support and the care of the
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
questions yes Senator thank you um I see
 
00:38:11.309 --> 00:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
that most of the de half the deaths were
 
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
due to drug
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
overdoses but when I look
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
at the next table seven it seems like
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
mental health conditions were as
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
important as substance use
 
00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.550 align:start position:0%
important as substance use
disorder

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
disorder
 
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
conditions um but when I look at page 11
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
the followup actions I don't see
 
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
expansion of mental health treatment so
 
00:38:47.309 --> 00:38:47.319 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering what let me just what your
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
thinking is or what you're
 
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
planning in addition to the substance
 
00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.870 align:start position:0%
planning in addition to the substance
use

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:38:55.309 --> 00:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
disorder expansion what are you doing
 
00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
for mental health
 
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
so um when we are doing the reviews uh
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
first of all we have to identify the
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
immediate cause of death which is um
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder and when we are
 
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
filling the Maria committee forms
 
00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
there's a question about circumstances
 
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
surrounding death and that's when we
 
00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
look at the medical records and review
 
00:39:20.829 --> 00:39:20.839 align:start position:0%
the case and we find that most of those
 
00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
who had overdose had a mental health
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
condition or they were seeking um mental
 
00:39:30.309 --> 00:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
health treatment so that's why table 7
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
has mental health conditions contributed
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
to death and this is for um out of the
 
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
21 dates that were reviewed between 2018
 
00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.550 align:start position:0%
21 dates that were reviewed between 2018
and

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
2022 uh your question regarding the
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations um on page 11 will be
 
00:39:50.829 --> 00:39:50.839 align:start position:0%
best answered by my colleague uh because
 
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
um they're in charge of the
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh however just to add a
 
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
little bit that so finding out that
 
00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
mental health condition was the leading
 
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
cause contributing factor it's like we
 
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
have to solve this underlying problem
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
that's why we uh beginning 2023 we
 
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
applied for a grant to start a patient
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
safety bundle which is on peral mental
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
health conditions and that bundle is
 
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
going to increase screening ear like
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
early screening treatment and
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
intervention for anyone with mental
 
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
health condition so that we can solve
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
this underlying problem I think my
 
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
colleague will want to add something on
 
00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:29.430 align:start position:0%
colleague will want to add something on
the

00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
same yes I just wanted to reiterate that
 
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
um we did in October roll out that
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
mental health safety bundle and that um
 
00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
we we've had um successes with the
 
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder bundle and um and
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
we're looking to the Future um we were
 
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
working on that one for you know it was
 
00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
since 20 2020 and that will still
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
continue on now we're adding to that the
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
mental health bundle and that will be
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
the expansion that we are working on I I
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
hope that answers your question thank
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you and thank you for the
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh report by the way I looked on page 11
 
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
and it talks about recommendations from
 
00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.309 align:start position:0%
and it talks about recommendations from
the

00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
mmrc the key says passed so does the
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
report in here somewhere I can't find it
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm seeing it but I don't
 
00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
recognize it is there a recommendations
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
from this report is as far as going
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
forward because this is dealing with
 
00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
what we have in the past so what are the
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations going
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
forward future
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations I'm sorry what page are
 
00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
you on you on page 11 it references
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
2022 and I believe you are it says
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
followup actions from past New Hampshire
 
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
mmrc recommendations so what looking
 
00:41:53.309 --> 00:41:53.319 align:start position:0%
forward what are the current ones going
 
00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
forward that we're looking to work on or
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:41:59.069 --> 00:41:59.079 align:start position:0%
put so the recommendations that were
 
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
10 and these recommend recommendations
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
came from all the cases that were
 
00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:12.839 align:start position:0%
reviewed back in
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
20122 I'll need to approve my ey
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
glasses they sell them at pharmacies
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative Weber and so my
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
understanding is those recommend are
 
00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
going ongoing now anding out into the
 
00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
future so we don't have to find a whole
 
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
another separate category that is
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
correct it's very interesting how they
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
all build on each other I mean really
 
00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
when you're um when you're working with
 
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
the trends um it's very clear that
 
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder and mental health
 
00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
issues are are really the the primary
 
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
focus of what you know we need to
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
collaborativ be working
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
on so they tend to come up again and
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
again if I
 
00:42:59.910 --> 00:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative I don't think you need to
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
convince anybody sitting at this table
 
00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
that the two are completely
 
00:43:09.069 --> 00:43:09.079 align:start position:0%
correlated representative McDonald thank
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um and thank you for
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
this report it's incredibly detailed and
 
00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:15.589 align:start position:0%
this report it's incredibly detailed and
and

00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
comprehensive um table five um looking
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
at that find it very interesting on page
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
15 uh the highest number of deaths were
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
those living with a
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
relative and it seems like and and I'm
 
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that's accurate do you know
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
anything behind that because I would
 
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
think homeless the homeless number would
 
00:43:39.549 --> 00:43:39.559 align:start position:0%
be higher for example than the someone
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
living with a relative and theoretically
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
having the support of family and so
 
00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.790 align:start position:0%
having the support of family and so
forth

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
forth
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
um apologies I was on a different table
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
five so I just noted you on the
 
00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
appendices page 50 okay sorry about that
 
00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
that's okay yeah so um so this
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
were I understand your concern about the
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
you believe the homeless should be
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
higher than this right however from the
 
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
cases we reviewed we found out that uh
 
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
very few owned like two of them owned a
 
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
house or owned their own space and the
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
three that we found were homeless we
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
just report what we see from the data
 
00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
that that's what we pulled however most
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
of them lived with relatives so that
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
means probably they don't have their own
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh housing and that's why the number is
 
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
eight as compared to those who are
 
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
homeless but still um we believe that
 
00:44:39.309 --> 00:44:39.319 align:start position:0%
the is accurate because we try to comb
 
00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:41.480 align:start position:0%
all sources to just make sure that what
 
00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
we are seeing in the records is what we
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
are presenting can I have a followup
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
followup uh so essentially the the eight
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
living with a relative is essentially
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
homeless that right yeah we we can say
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
that yeah because U majority were either
 
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
living with their mother or um just a
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
relative so definitely their income as
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
you saw in one of the tables
 
00:45:04.549 --> 00:45:04.559 align:start position:0%
unemployment was another not actually
 
00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
the tables on the what we read
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
unemployment was another stressor for
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
these um pregnancy related debts so
 
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
their income is low so definitely they
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
are living with a relative because
 
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
they're not able to sustain
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
themselves thank you you're
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
welcome Senator rosenal thank you on on
 
00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.870 align:start position:0%
welcome Senator rosenal thank you on on
page

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
14 why is the
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
number of deaths from 2017 to 2022
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
different in table four than it is in
 
00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.829 align:start position:0%
different in table four than it is in
table

00:45:40.829 --> 00:45:40.839 align:start position:0%
table
 
00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:43.880 align:start position:0%
three yeah thank you for that question
 
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
and uh that's a wonderful um notice so
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
the number is supposed to be consistence
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
I guess I have to look one more time uh
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
why the totals are not 38 I thought they
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
should be 38 but I have to counter check
 
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions
 
00:46:14.309 --> 00:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Miss Whitman and Dr Nai for
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
coming before us in this report thank
 
00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
you and I just noted it's the addition
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
that is the issue but it's the total st8
 
00:46:22.349 --> 00:46:22.359 align:start position:0%

00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
this the scheduled uh presentation was
 
00:48:20.589 --> 00:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
uh a provision in hb2 of 2023 session
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
about uh the implementation of um the
 
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
postp partner coverage and what I
 
00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
basically did in this report was pulled
 
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
language from the statute um and the the
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
first thing that we had to do was submit
 
00:48:38.589 --> 00:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
a state plan by August 15 which we did
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
on August
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
14th um we did receive an approval um U
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
on November 2nd with a retroactive date
 
00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
back to October 1st so coverage in New
 
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh for postpartum began on
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
October 1st um and um it's a little bit
 
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
early for me to report out um uh
 
00:49:01.789 --> 00:49:01.799 align:start position:0%
statistics on the implementation
 
00:49:03.549 --> 00:49:03.559 align:start position:0%
components but we did Implement
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
according to the state plan all the the
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
different Provisions um I would expect
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
to on a uh quarterly basis give you some
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
update on um how the program is working
 
00:49:16.789 --> 00:49:16.799 align:start position:0%
I think it will take a little while to
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
see um morbidity and mortality changes
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
but um I think we can at least start to
 
00:49:26.109 --> 00:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
look at some access measures um
 
00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
you know I think uh we had a a
 
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
three-hour meeting this week internally
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
with u the people who just presented
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
with you Medicaid and public health got
 
00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
together to look at sort of
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities to to collaborate closer
 
00:49:44.109 --> 00:49:44.119 align:start position:0%
um on on these issues and um I'm hoping
 
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
that we'll have some real results to to
 
00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:50.079 align:start position:0%
show in terms of preventing um
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
conditions of complications and and
 
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
death um and uh the last last item that
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
we were was a little uh tucked away in
 
00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
in that same section was a report on um
 
00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
legislation that was passed uh in 2021
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
about opening up the maternal home
 
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
visiting programs and um what I've
 
00:50:15.309 --> 00:50:15.319 align:start position:0%
included in the report at the end is
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
basically that we did um follow through
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
essentially what the legislation
 
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:22.799 align:start position:0%
intended to do was you know the 20101
 
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:25.079 align:start position:0%
period if you remember was a extreme
 
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
finan challenges for the state and
 
00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
basically we reopened um the eligibility
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
um and then also clarified providers and
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
um other aspects that sort of modernized
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
the rule back in uh June of
 
00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
2022 um I I don't have anything more
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
today on that if there's something of
 
00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
particular interest um I could come back
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
with some utilization statistics or
 
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
something like that I just did not have
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
time I apologize to complete that before
 
00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:56.710 align:start position:0%
time I apologize to complete that before
today

00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:50:59.230 --> 00:50:59.240 align:start position:0%
I I would say that would be very helpful
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
she would say that would be very helpful
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
so would I we will'll do that for next
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh quarters report um the second thing I
 
00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:09.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh come and talk to you about
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
was give you an update on the unwind um
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
and you know essentially um the first
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
page of your uh package at the the top
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
of the two lines of it gives you a
 
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
comparison of pre pandemic against post
 
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
pandemic we're as of uh the end of
 
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
179,180 th000 so end of month tends to
 
00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:43.240 align:start position:0%
be a lower um enrollment number but
 
00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
seems to be fluctuating between around
 
00:51:49.069 --> 00:51:49.079 align:start position:0%
180 and 182 at this point in terms of
 
00:51:52.589 --> 00:51:52.599 align:start position:0%
enrollment um also keep in mind that um
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
in addition to the postpartum coverage
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
that you passed you also uh passed um
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
for legally residing um uh individuals
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
women and children to be able to get
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
coverage that went into effect on um
 
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
January 1st also um federally all states
 
00:52:14.309 --> 00:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
need to continuously enroll children for
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
a 12- month period and children is up
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
through up to uh through 18 years of age
 
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
um so that we we'll see I think over the
 
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:23.720 align:start position:0%
course of year some increase in
 
00:52:25.789 --> 00:52:25.799 align:start position:0%
enrollment as a result of those
 
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
two things in addition I think the
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
system of care um part of hb2 um which
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
you may remember u in the Senate anyways
 
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate Bill 36 um that uh there were
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
some income disregards that were um
 
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
increased as a part of that legislation
 
00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
and those went into effect January 1 so
 
00:52:47.549 --> 00:52:47.559 align:start position:0%
we could see a little bit more
 
00:52:51.309 --> 00:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
enrollment as a result of that um
 
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
another key thing because it was in the
 
00:52:56.109 --> 00:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
news I just like to um speak to a couple
 
00:52:58.349 --> 00:52:58.359 align:start position:0%
of slides here
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
um the second page um you know the CMS
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
had um identified New Hampshire along
 
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
with nine other states as having a
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
change in enrollment of children that
 
00:53:13.789 --> 00:53:13.799 align:start position:0%
was um was larger um I think that that
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
report had a lot of uh flaws in it they
 
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
compared states that began in March
 
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
versus states that may have begun in
 
00:53:23.069 --> 00:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
July and you know you would have
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
different outcomes but one of the things
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
want to share with you there's been a
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
you know a significant established Trend
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
long before the pandemic began of
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
decreased enrollment in children we see
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
that in school enrollments as well
 
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
um um that being said um I'm going to
 
00:53:42.589 --> 00:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
speak to a little bit more what we have
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
done and what we did do as a result of
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
that um that that information coming
 
00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.109 align:start position:0%
that um that that information coming
from

00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:53:53.069 --> 00:53:53.079 align:start position:0%
CMS um the third slide in you know is
 
00:53:55.109 --> 00:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
another sort of reason why children and
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
enrollment might be less there are fewer
 
00:54:00.789 --> 00:54:00.799 align:start position:0%
um children under 18 years of age um in
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
2022 compared to 2016 again that's
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
showing up in in our uh enrollment in
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
schools which I think you're down more
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
than 20,000 students um in terms of of
 
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
income New Hampshire has the fifth
 
00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
highest enrollment excuse me fifth
 
00:54:20.349 --> 00:54:20.359 align:start position:0%
highest eligibility level meaning it's
 
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
easier to enroll a child in um Medicaid
 
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
we go up to 32 % of the poverty the
 
00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
national average is only 217% of poverty
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
so what we've seen is an increase in in
 
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:40.829 --> 00:54:40.839 align:start position:0%
300% um and then also the next Slide the
 
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
fist slide in um there are uh people
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
with U 400% of income I guess that's
 
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
basically we as we've seen the New
 
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy has bounce back after
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
um sort of the the two 2020 21 2020
 
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
impact of of being unwind so then on the
 
00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
sixth slide is a a table actually I
 
00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
prepared for CMS to sort of give them
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
some feedback on what we're actually
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
seeing and when they looked at children
 
00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
they they looked at it differently than
 
00:55:14.349 --> 00:55:14.359 align:start position:0%
we had been um they looked at it as
 
00:55:20.349 --> 00:55:20.359 align:start position:0%
anyone 23 years of age or younger and so
 
00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:23.480 align:start position:0%
um the reason they did that is because
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
certain kids like Foster children could
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
still have coverage so okay now that
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
we're both looking at the same group of
 
00:55:33.549 --> 00:55:33.559 align:start position:0%
of children so what we did is we pull
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
together an analysis here of children
 
00:55:38.349 --> 00:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
who on March 1st of
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
2023 um were on Medicaid and looked at
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
what the outcomes of those children were
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
and we divided that between protected
 
00:55:51.029 --> 00:55:51.039 align:start position:0%
and nonprotected uh children and so that
 
00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
um with respect to um the the size of
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
these two groups the protected group if
 
00:55:59.230 --> 00:55:59.240 align:start position:0%
you look at the bottom of that slide was
 
00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:04.950 align:start position:0%
you look at the bottom of that slide was
36,24120

00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
of that larger Group which is sort of
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
the middle column um only 133% did not
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
retain coverage compared to the
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
projected Group which is on the left
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
which was um a little over 50% 50 uh
 
00:56:26.109 --> 00:56:26.119 align:start position:0%
51.1% retain coverage
 
00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
um some of them remained in as
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
children's coverage small percentage 3.2
 
00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
ended up in granted Advantage uh 0 4%
 
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
and other 3% and then in and out um but
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
if you look at the reasons why they
 
00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
closed in that First Column um income
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
47% closed because of income there's not
 
00:56:50.109 --> 00:56:50.119 align:start position:0%
much we can do if you're over 323 per of
 
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
poverty there's not much we can do with
 
00:56:56.190 --> 00:56:56.200 align:start position:0%
that um failing to complete a
 
00:56:59.390 --> 00:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
redetermination um that that was
 
00:57:02.829 --> 00:57:02.839 align:start position:0%
28.5% again we've done amazing amount of
 
00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:05.839 align:start position:0%
Outreach um and what we've done in terms
 
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
of this failed to read group and the
 
00:57:10.589 --> 00:57:10.599 align:start position:0%
fail to verify group we've actually done
 
00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
um most recently and are about to
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
complete we've called every single one
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
of those individuals again um and and an
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
effort from the department and the mcos
 
00:57:23.549 --> 00:57:23.559 align:start position:0%
we've also built reports with the for
 
00:57:27.309 --> 00:57:27.319 align:start position:0%
the fqhcs C mhc's because this is a a
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
fixed population we're able to identify
 
00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
them and and provide information we're
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
working to make sure that they have
 
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:35.720 align:start position:0%
every opportunity to try to come back on
 
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
either to complete their redetermination
 
00:57:41.029 --> 00:57:41.039 align:start position:0%
or not but when you look at you know why
 
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
kids were
 
00:57:44.829 --> 00:57:44.839 align:start position:0%
disenrolled um you know failed to reduce
 
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
a concerning number but it it sometimes
 
00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:49.400 align:start position:0%
it can be because the family doesn't
 
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
feel like they're eligible um and we've
 
00:57:54.589 --> 00:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
certainly gone round after round of
 
00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
trying trying to do Outreach there but
 
00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
you know that being said we are making
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
one more um good try effort to try to uh
 
00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
reach all these folks and remember
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is a continuously open program
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
so if they um change um the other thing
 
00:58:13.549 --> 00:58:13.559 align:start position:0%
that would be interesting to note we
 
00:58:15.789 --> 00:58:15.799 align:start position:0%
don't really have good insight into it
 
00:58:19.069 --> 00:58:19.079 align:start position:0%
yet but New Hampshire's um exchange
 
00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
coverage the ACA coverage that we've
 
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:23.480 align:start position:0%
seen a 19% growth according to The
 
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
Navigators and a call I had with them
 
00:58:28.109 --> 00:58:28.119 align:start position:0%
this morning um and that doesn't also
 
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
measure um some families that may have
 
00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
gotten off exchange coverage um meaning
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
they didn't qualify for any subsidies so
 
00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
I think we are seeing some people
 
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
getting coverage elsewhere you can see a
 
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
little bit of that in in this data as
 
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
well um so that's what I have on that
 
00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:47.910 align:start position:0%
well um so that's what I have on that
slide

00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
slide
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
um then um have uh a couple of different
 
00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
sort of uh picture graphs that have
 
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
different information about where we are
 
00:59:01.549 --> 00:59:01.559 align:start position:0%
with the unwind the first one on slides
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
the seventh slide in um shows that there
 
00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:08.200 align:start position:0%
300 if you look on the far right the top
 
00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
how many red determinations are left to
 
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
do um of the nearly 104,000 we have 350
 
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
left as of the end of December um we're
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
taking our time as as much as we can
 
00:59:22.829 --> 00:59:22.839 align:start position:0%
we're actually going out to May for for
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
those who are like the Homing community
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
base to make sure that we have enough
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
bandwidth to help them we're finding
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
that particularly the people in um
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
homebound have the most challenge in
 
00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
completing the process so we've ex we've
 
00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:38.200 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of a number of
 
00:59:40.589 --> 00:59:40.599 align:start position:0%
flexibilities including extending the
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
period of time to accomplish
 
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
that um in the bottom left I won't go
 
00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
over all this chart but you can see that
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
um there are summary statistics for
 
00:59:53.309 --> 00:59:53.319 align:start position:0%
closure reasons income is the number one
 
00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
reason that um
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
that the protected population
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
closed um and there's a chart on
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
children um children was the number one
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
reason on the bottom left was failed to
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
redetermined very closely by by
 
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
income um in this case again I think
 
01:00:19.029 --> 01:00:19.039 align:start position:0%
that one of our early campaigns back in
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
May was when we heard that National
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
stories about parents um if they were
 
01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
not eligible thinking that their child
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
could be eligible we did a round of
 
01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
phone calls then to make sure that um
 
01:00:34.029 --> 01:00:34.039 align:start position:0%
all of the the individuals were who had
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
clothes with children that they were
 
01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
aware that there was an opportunity to
 
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
keep the kids covered and and we're
 
01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
doing that as part of our our current
 
01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
Outreach um the next slide uh is the
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
long-term care and disabled population
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
most you can see from this slide on the
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
top right um the future redeterminations
 
01:00:58.349 --> 01:00:58.359 align:start position:0%
that's the majority of people that are
 
01:01:00.549 --> 01:01:00.559 align:start position:0%
left to redetermining the long-term care
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
and disabled
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
group um income is the number one reason
 
01:01:09.029 --> 01:01:09.039 align:start position:0%
follow closely behind failed to
 
01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
redetermined again we're doing um doing
 
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
continued Outreach uh to this population
 
01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:19.960 align:start position:0%
um so the next slide slide 10 is really
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
an interesting slide to me in terms of
 
01:01:27.069 --> 01:01:27.079 align:start position:0%
um exp part rates expart means that the
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
department has enough information um
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
based on what access that we have to
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
various sources that we can determine
 
01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
that they're eligible um you can see a
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
significant increase in the expart rate
 
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
as we go further into the unwind in part
 
01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
that's because we left people who
 
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
expected to be covered to later in the
 
01:01:50.029 --> 01:01:50.039 align:start position:0%
unwind um and so in terms of this has
 
01:01:51.789 --> 01:01:51.799 align:start position:0%
been something that the feds have
 
01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
focused on in terms of state's
 
01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
performance and I think we're you know
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
standing out pretty well there and
 
01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
um uh the next slide is uh a look at
 
01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at this the monthly
 
01:02:08.829 --> 01:02:08.839 align:start position:0%
statistics which are coming up in the
 
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
chart there are some people we don't
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
complete in a month this is something
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
CMS has asked states to do is to look
 
01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
back 90 days did anybody who didn't
 
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
redetermined um by the end of their
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
month did they later come back on and
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
you can see in the orange that um people
 
01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
who didn't complete and you can see
 
01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
month by month um that people do come
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
back on even if they don't if they're
 
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799 align:start position:0%
shown as not renewing in in the current
 
01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:41.839 align:start position:0%
month um you know August has a bigger uh
 
01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:44.559 align:start position:0%
set of numbers and that's part when we
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
implemented an extra 60 days for the
 
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
disabled U and waiver populations and
 
01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
long-term care so that you would expect
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
the pending to be larger because because
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
we're giving them more
 
01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
time um if I can jump down to the um the
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
next slide
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
um you know throughout the unwind these
 
01:03:10.029 --> 01:03:10.039 align:start position:0%
are statistics that that tie to what we
 
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
report to the federal government that
 
01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
um uh the if you look at sort of the
 
01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
flesh tone color line that's the the
 
01:03:22.349 --> 01:03:22.359 align:start position:0%
percent of people that retain coverage
 
01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:24.839 align:start position:0%
um the grand total
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
and then divided by the protected and
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
nonprotected but if you jump down to the
 
01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
slide that follows and look at a more
 
01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
recent month um and look at that plush
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
tone line 91.3% of the the non-protected
 
01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
population retain coverage and 54.7 of
 
01:03:45.309 --> 01:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
the protected again I think that
 
01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:47.720 align:start position:0%
reflects our unwind strategy of the
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
people that we thought were most likely
 
01:03:51.789 --> 01:03:51.799 align:start position:0%
to retain coverage would and if you if
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
we if I had all the slides in here and I
 
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
didn't want to bury you in slides
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
because I have given you enough but if
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
you went back all the way to September
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
you start to see the real shift in the
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
number of people um retaining coverage
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
and you also see that in that graph of
 
01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
exp parte uh renewals and
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
um the next slide is just about
 
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
reopenings people if they're going to
 
01:04:16.589 --> 01:04:16.599 align:start position:0%
reopen they're typically doing that
 
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
within a 90-day window um and the final
 
01:04:23.309 --> 01:04:23.319 align:start position:0%
slide is just some of our call campaign
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
activity that's done
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
the most concerned patients we have for
 
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
by looking at Medical claims we have our
 
01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
medical team do outbound calls and what
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
we're finding is a lot the most the
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
majority of people are it's not that
 
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
they're not aware that it's just taking
 
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
them time to complete their
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
redetermination you know 50 almost 54%
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
are aware they're in process and by the
 
01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
time we get to them about 30 and a half
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
percent are already um completed that's
 
01:04:57.309 --> 01:04:57.319 align:start position:0%
spoken a lot and thrown a lot at you but
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
I hope uh you get a general sense at
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
least from the conversation here that
 
01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
you know we're doing better as we go
 
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
along as expected and we're we're pretty
 
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
close to being finished with the the
 
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
unwind um population representative
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
Weber I'm sorry I I'm I'm feeling like
 
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
the days in law school where I was
 
01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
required to confess to the professor
 
01:05:23.269 --> 01:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
when I came to class unprepared and I
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
did come to class
 
01:05:27.069 --> 01:05:27.079 align:start position:0%
unprepared uh although you sent out a
 
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
lot of this material beforehand and
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
because I am scribbling with my right
 
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
hand I can't also flip the charts with
 
01:05:35.789 --> 01:05:35.799 align:start position:0%
my left
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
hand could you back up one step and
 
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
explain to me again about protected and
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
unprotected classes because I would have
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
thought just without looking at anything
 
01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
that a the protected class would be the
 
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
ones that have the highest retention
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
rates and it it's backwards every time
 
01:05:58.910 --> 01:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
you mention those categories so I need a
 
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:01.640 align:start position:0%
reeducation it is counterintuitive for
 
01:06:04.109 --> 01:06:04.119 align:start position:0%
people who were protected were probably
 
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:07.640 align:start position:0%
back in March of 2020 um were were
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
covered by Medicaid and three years or
 
01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:15.640 align:start position:0%
longer they haven't had to reup whether
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
they're eligible or not and so you know
 
01:06:20.549 --> 01:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
in March of 2020 there was a whole lot
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
of people that came on board because
 
01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
they lost their jobs as a result of the
 
01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
pandemic so people you know the economy
 
01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
has gotten better people have come back
 
01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:33.160 align:start position:0%
to work and so forth or they aged out of
 
01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
their you know being out in a category
 
01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
that's eligible so like for example in
 
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
graned Advantage we had people who were
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
you know it's that's a great program for
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
people who are older adults who may lose
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
a job later in life now they're Medicare
 
01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
eligible so they left the program
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
because they're Medicare eligible so we
 
01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
expected all along that about the
 
01:06:54.029 --> 01:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
percentage that we're seeing in the
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
protected group would would leave
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
because of various reasons like
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
that thank you you're welcome
 
01:07:01.359 --> 01:07:03.870 align:start position:0%
that thank you you're welcome
representative

01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:07.480 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you El I wanted to thank
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
you as always the information you
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
provide to this committee is incredibly
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
detailed very thorough and I want to
 
01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
recognize that thank you in regards to
 
01:07:19.549 --> 01:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
one of the things you mentioned that
 
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
sort of caught my attention it's a
 
01:07:25.390 --> 01:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
little bit of a on page 50
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
it goes back into the yellow unaware
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
child income difference and you sort of
 
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
talked about that before where the
 
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
parents' income and the children's
 
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
income if they're in the same household
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
how are they different because there
 
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
really is one source of income it's the
 
01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
parents so the eligibility criteria if
 
01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
you're for example in the granted
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
Advantage the Medicaid expansion your
 
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
income is 138% so if you're at
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
150% you don't qualify for for medic
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
Medicade but if your if your household
 
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
is below
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
323 the CH children still
 
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
would so so I can I think I understand
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
it want to be sure so basically there's
 
01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
different levels depending upon whether
 
01:08:10.269 --> 01:08:10.279 align:start position:0%
you're an adult or child yes or whether
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
you're a waiver there's you know there's
 
01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
a page too big for me to memorize of
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
different categories but generally what
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
it it comes down to is that you know the
 
01:08:22.990 --> 01:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
program tilts in favor of children
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
remaining covered terms of the
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
eligibility levels of the highest thank
 
01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
you I have a couple of questions on
 
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
pages seven eight and N maybe more on
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
the left side you have a wonderful map
 
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and I love well I love
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire too but I love maps and I
 
01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
think the reason Rockingham County is
 
01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
always in dark blue is because we have
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
310,000 people yes might the same kind
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
of data be presented with maps where the
 
01:08:56.829 --> 01:08:56.839 align:start position:0%
number the raw number is as a percentage
 
01:08:59.709 --> 01:08:59.719 align:start position:0%
of the population of the state I I do
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
have those I bet you do we um we just
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
again just trying to I'm not I could
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
bury you in in charts and crafts and
 
01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
stuff but bring it on
 
01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
okay my second question is I have a few
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
friends yes who believe prolife is from
 
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
birth and we expanded one month after
 
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
birth to 12 and for the sake of any of
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
my aforementioned friends whom I listen
 
01:09:34.349 --> 01:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
to me I would love to have numbers and
 
01:09:36.749 --> 01:09:36.759 align:start position:0%
especially Narrative of how that
 
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
expansion from one month to 12 months
 
01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
has done good both from a human
 
01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:45.400 align:start position:0%
compassion point of view but also
 
01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps even from a financial point of
 
01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
view which is the metric that some
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
people only focus on so I just want to
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand your question
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
your referring to the I just want I'm
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
not sure I picked up on it well we
 
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
passed something you referenced it yes
 
01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
that oh the the coverage of uh
 
01:10:06.990 --> 01:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
postpartum extension yes okay now I got
 
01:10:09.149 --> 01:10:09.159 align:start position:0%
you I just want that for me would be a
 
01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
very helpful apologetic to people who
 
01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:14.679 align:start position:0%
are still not convinced yeah I I think
 
01:10:18.669 --> 01:10:18.679 align:start position:0%
that probably of of um among the thing
 
01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
top things that I think will affect
 
01:10:23.709 --> 01:10:23.719 align:start position:0%
people in real real way is that coverage
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
the adult dental coverage because I
 
01:10:27.669 --> 01:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
think in the postpartum coverage if you
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
think about um particularly sud mental
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
illness um you know postpartum
 
01:10:38.110 --> 01:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
depression you know to try to get access
 
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
even if you have the best insurance in
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
the state to to try to get everything
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
done within you know um 60 days of of
 
01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
birth it's just it's it's unrealistic
 
01:10:52.830 --> 01:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
and so that's I think um you know one of
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
the things I think we're going to look
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
at is what difference does this this
 
01:10:58.110 --> 01:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
make and I think you know along with my
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
back here we yes yeah see I get it from
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
having been in the people business for
 
01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
50 years but for those who really do
 
01:11:09.630 --> 01:11:09.640 align:start position:0%
need convincing and might either be
 
01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
convinced by the H humanitarianism of it
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
or just the dollar and cense of it uh
 
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful follow up after
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
this has happened for a while I I I
 
01:11:26.189 --> 01:11:26.199 align:start position:0%
agree oh okay representative
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chairman um Mr
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
Litman could you and I know you already
 
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
did but if you if you're good to repeat
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
it what is the definition of expar in
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
this case sure it's when we have enough
 
01:11:42.629 --> 01:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
information um for
 
01:11:44.629 --> 01:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
example granted Advantage is probably
 
01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
the easiest one that's an income
 
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
eligible program um we get feeds of of
 
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
of individuals income if they're not
 
01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
self-employed as an example um and so if
 
01:11:58.990 --> 01:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
we know what their income is um and they
 
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
we're required under law to work with
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
the information we have and and that's
 
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
what it means is that we have all the
 
01:12:07.229 --> 01:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
information we need to know to know that
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
this person is eligible and so we don't
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
make them complete paperwork that is
 
01:12:15.149 --> 01:12:15.159 align:start position:0%
something we already know about I just
 
01:12:17.629 --> 01:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
follow up uh so in other words um just
 
01:12:19.229 --> 01:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
to clarify they don't have to go through
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
the reading process you they don't have
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
to fill out an application any of that
 
01:12:25.149 --> 01:12:25.159 align:start position:0%
stuff right you already have what you
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
have you need yeah so I give you a good
 
01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
example of something that I've you know
 
01:12:31.629 --> 01:12:31.639 align:start position:0%
and going through the NWI one of the
 
01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
things I've noticed is that particularly
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
the granted something I hadn't thought
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
about until going through this process
 
01:12:40.629 --> 01:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
and looking at the churn that happens
 
01:12:42.629 --> 01:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes is that
 
01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
um that people who are are disabled you
 
01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
takes a while to prove your disability
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
um and so granted Advantage sometimes
 
01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
becomes a very uh important bridge to at
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
least having medical coverage until that
 
01:13:02.430 --> 01:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
disability may be determined so like a
 
01:13:04.669 --> 01:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
case like that where someone it may take
 
01:13:06.270 --> 01:13:06.280 align:start position:0%
six months or a year sometimes to get
 
01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
through that process um that you know
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
someone who we know is unemployed still
 
01:13:13.709 --> 01:13:13.719 align:start position:0%
because of their
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
disability they have no income rather
 
01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
than making them go through all that
 
01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
paperwork of doing a redetermination we
 
01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
have enough information to to to let
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
them know we've seen what your situation
 
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
is and we're extending you for the
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
period of time and you're required to
 
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
let us know of a change in circumstance
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
but your your eligibility continues one
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
more follow one more followup um okay
 
01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
and and that's that makes a lot of sense
 
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
um is there any question about whether
 
01:13:45.629 --> 01:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
you might not have the most accurate
 
01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
information and maybe some people might
 
01:13:50.830 --> 01:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
slip by who aren't eligible is there any
 
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
concerns about that um I think that
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
there there always is some risk of of
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
that but I I think it's probably pretty
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
minuscule I mean I think um you know in
 
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
one sense we're kind of we do required
 
01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
under we could get penalized the other
 
01:14:11.709 --> 01:14:11.719 align:start position:0%
way for for for you know ruling people
 
01:14:14.629 --> 01:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
out based on information we do have so
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like if you will the grand
 
01:14:19.149 --> 01:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
bargain with the the feds in terms of
 
01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
they're giving us 90% example and that
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to follow their regulation
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
um okay thank you Senator Rosenwald
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you morning Henry um my question
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
is about children with
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities I see on page one that the
 
01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
rate the current number is down 18%
 
01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
versus prepandemic
 
01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
but the decline in the number of
 
01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
children in state is closer to 4%
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
so what's up so we did we did get that
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
question from one of the executive
 
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
councils a little while ago and did uh
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
look into that issue and um most of it
 
01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
was aging out
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
um um and um so we didn't see anything
 
01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
and I can um follow up with the analysis
 
01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
that we did uh Senator to give you some
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
comfort there um but certainly
 
01:15:26.830 --> 01:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
the the K the children I worry about
 
01:15:29.229 --> 01:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
Katy Becket uh type cases and things
 
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
like that that um you sometimes that
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
journey of particularly like cases where
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
they now have got gone over 18 years of
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
age they're still a child in the eyes of
 
01:15:43.709 --> 01:15:43.719 align:start position:0%
the the parent right they're 19 or 20
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
there's some things that happen there um
 
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
and just going through the process it's
 
01:15:53.229 --> 01:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
it's not easy to do and so um again
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
again that's why I think we're trying to
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
give more time in the process to work
 
01:15:58.830 --> 01:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
there and and when you know there have
 
01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
been some cases I always encourage you
 
01:16:03.870 --> 01:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
if you hear of a situation to to bring
 
01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
it to me because they're small enough
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
that you know we can provide individual
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
attention to see what's going on there
 
01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
um we've met recently as as early as
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
this week with um a provider that
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
provides a lot of support to
 
01:16:23.229 --> 01:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
individuals um who are sort of Katy Beck
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
eligible and making sure she understood
 
01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
what the criteria are and you know said
 
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
created an Open Door one of the state
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
senators had connected her to us so
 
01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of stuff we appreciate
 
01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:36.280 align:start position:0%
because if something's not going the way
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
it should from we'd like to know about
 
01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
it maybe it is because it isn't or or
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
maybe it's there's something we could do
 
01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:44.430 align:start position:0%
maybe it's there's something we could do
to

01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
help follow so so it doesn't mean that
 
01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
more children are being born without
 
01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities no I think it's more that
 
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
there's less children and less children
 
01:16:59.950 --> 01:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
that may meet the income qualifications
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
approved but I'd be happy to follow up
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:13.470 --> 01:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
thank anything further for Mr Lipman I
 
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
notice Mr chy is taking great mental
 
01:17:16.199 --> 01:17:18.990 align:start position:0%
notice Mr chy is taking great mental

01:17:18.990 --> 01:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
Here do you have a business card
 
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.950 align:start position:0%
Here do you have a business card
yet

01:17:25.950 --> 01:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
yeah anybody else um had a quick one on
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
Dental if you were um I provided three
 
01:17:35.310 --> 01:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
slides there if you have time we're
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
going to give in the schedule I think we
 
01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
will so let's uh let's get our I'm going
 
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
to say it let's get our teeth into this
 
01:17:44.669 --> 01:17:44.679 align:start position:0%
one you knew it's coming knew you knew
 
01:17:46.030 --> 01:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
that was coming you already wrote it in
 
01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:49.510 align:start position:0%
that was coming you already wrote it in
the

01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:51.629 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

01:17:51.629 --> 01:17:51.639 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
um the second second slide is um the
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
number of
 
01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
encounters um both in claims and in um
 
01:18:07.870 --> 01:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
individual people uh seen and as you
 
01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
look at the later months you see a a
 
01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
little bit of a decline there part of
 
01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
that is the time frame to submit claims
 
01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:15.870 align:start position:0%
that is the time frame to submit claims
December

01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
December
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
also because um you know pra physician
 
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
practices may not maintain the same
 
01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
schedule over the holidays um but you
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
can see generally the trend has been in
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
a positive direction um that you know
 
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
for more months than than not more than
 
01:18:38.430 --> 01:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
2,000 adults have been seen um and that
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
you know we've had a high of 3,000
 
01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
individual claims um in the month of
 
01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:44.830 align:start position:0%
individual claims um in the month of
November

01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
November
 
01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
um and uh the third slide in is the
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
unique providers I think that we're up
 
01:18:54.910 --> 01:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
to 158 now
 
01:18:58.750 --> 01:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
um and uh I I had hoped I was supposed
 
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
to get this morning and it may be in my
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
email was the I think the last time I
 
01:19:04.590 --> 01:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
presented to you was in the 120
 
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
neighborhood um so we have made some
 
01:19:10.629 --> 01:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
slow and steady progress in in building
 
01:19:13.470 --> 01:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
out the network
 
01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
um and where we're not building out the
 
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
network um the last slide is you know
 
01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
we're still um utilizing mobile clinics
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
that are not schedule for uh the rest of
 
01:19:28.510 --> 01:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
January and February is up here on the
 
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
on that slide um Dr finny's away so this
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
week so I didn't have a chance to to do
 
01:19:37.629 --> 01:19:37.639 align:start position:0%
as much here as I'd like either but um
 
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
next time that you have time for me I'd
 
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
be happy to Dr Finny to to elaborate a
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
little bit more there was I think
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
U recently um CMS published on their uh
 
01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:53.800 align:start position:0%
dashboard of
 
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
um public information
 
01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
about um uh different children's
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
indicators and and one of them was um
 
01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
connected to U applying sealant and in
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
both situations in the Children's Dental
 
01:20:13.229 --> 01:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
we were well above the national average
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
in in that which um you know I think
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh says a lot um in terms of what we've
 
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
been able to do now that we've had the
 
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
been able to fund through hb2 the rate
 
01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
increase to match up Children's Dental
 
01:20:30.189 --> 01:20:30.199 align:start position:0%
with adult Dental I think will continue
 
01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
to make progress
 
01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
there having grown up in lemonster it
 
01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
does my heart good to see that at least
 
01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
in this Worcester County is now part of
 
01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:40.590 align:start position:0%
in this Worcester County is now part of
New

01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes sir um could you speak and
 
01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
you know this is a question I bring up a
 
01:20:51.229 --> 01:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
lot uh any status report on incentive
 
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
programs for new dentist s to
 
01:20:55.629 --> 01:20:55.639 align:start position:0%
participate in this especially new
 
01:20:58.709 --> 01:20:58.719 align:start position:0%
dentists with lots of dchool loans
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
outstanding any update you can give us
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
we do um and I think still here um in
 
01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
terms of loan repayment program um we do
 
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
have a couple of dentists coming up for
 
01:21:15.950 --> 01:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh receiving loans um in that space and
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
I think even some of the hygienists as
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
well um so I think you know it's
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
important to have both pieces to to have
 
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
a practice so I think there's been more
 
01:21:29.470 --> 01:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
activity there um and I think probably
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
Sarah could add some more Dimensions to
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
that than I than I am able to today if
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
next time she or you are here and
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
speaking on this a one-pager you know
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
half a page with numbers and graphs and
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
so on and a half a page in narrative
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful for me because
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
this is a selling point I try to use
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
with some folks so one thing Delta has
 
01:21:52.270 --> 01:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
done on the um you know they had the
 
01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
thousand sign on bonus which they
 
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
extended and extended I'm not sure
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
whether they still extended it but I can
 
01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:02.719 align:start position:0%
find out have their address of when that
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
may have come to a close or if it has
 
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
the second thing is that um you know
 
01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
where they have received feedback from
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
practicing dentists about the fee
 
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
schedule Delta out of their own um
 
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
medical cost and are or dental cost
 
01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
rather are um enhanced the New Hampshire
 
01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
Fe scheduled to try to deal with
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
procedures where dentists felt there may
 
01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
still be an undervalue um and um she can
 
01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
give you more details on that as well
 
01:22:34.239 --> 01:22:36.030 align:start position:0%
give you more details on that as well

Merchant

01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
Merchant
 
01:22:40.669 --> 01:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
you a question for you in regards to on
 
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
the third page it's svin County it has
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
two contracted dentist it's encouraging
 
01:22:48.910 --> 01:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
to see that in windso which is adjacent
 
01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
to the county of Sullivan in the vont
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
side has eight but when I go to the last
 
01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:56.639 align:start position:0%
page and I look at what's available for
 
01:22:59.709 --> 01:22:59.719 align:start position:0%
the mobile D downal Clinic I don't see
 
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
svin County on there I I know that um an
 
01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
Landry who's my associate commissioner
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
made that point to me too before and I
 
01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
know one of the issues there has been
 
01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
finding a site to site it um I know that
 
01:23:15.669 --> 01:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
based on a couple meetings ago that
 
01:23:17.629 --> 01:23:17.639 align:start position:0%
that's a priority I don't know whether
 
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
in before this whether they actually
 
01:23:21.149 --> 01:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
made it there or not and I can get back
 
01:23:24.350 --> 01:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
to or not but I know s was on our radar
 
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
to to get there for just the reason you
 
01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:28.189 align:start position:0%
to to get there for just the reason you
talked

01:23:28.189 --> 01:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
talked
 
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
about follow
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
up in regards to a site within Sullivan
 
01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
County what's involved
 
01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
to require a site um I'd be more than
 
01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:40.719 align:start position:0%
glad to try to make some calls inquir
 
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
with people within the county for a site
 
01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:45.719 align:start position:0%
if I understand what's required yeah um
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
I I probably can have Sarah do that but
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
the the major thing we see is that this
 
01:23:53.310 --> 01:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
is a a very big vehicle um in terms of
 
01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
and then being able to get the um I
 
01:23:58.590 --> 01:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
guess the connections there but um Sarah
 
01:24:00.629 --> 01:24:00.639 align:start position:0%
has all those details and I know she's
 
01:24:02.669 --> 01:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
been working on it because it it came up
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
previously and and my boss and told me
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%

public awareness campaign so I've

document and I'd like to just focus um
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
on those and then Jessica would like to
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%

01:25:54.270 --> 01:25:54.280 align:start position:0%
the committee talking about our plan and
 
01:25:57.550 --> 01:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
partnering with others to develop a
 
01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
request for proposals um that has been
 
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
released and we are currently in the
 
01:26:06.510 --> 01:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
procurement process so uh there may be
 
01:26:07.950 --> 01:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
questions that I may not be able to
 
01:26:10.189 --> 01:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
fully answer because we're still in that
 
01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
procurement process but I did provide a
 
01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:16.960 align:start position:0%

documents related to this procurement on
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%

into us and that we've replied to um
 
01:26:35.950 --> 01:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
that may help with providing a little
 
01:26:41.149 --> 01:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
bit of an update on um interest in uh
 
01:26:45.030 --> 01:26:45.040 align:start position:0%

coming from a different perspective uh
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
looking at it through a different lens
 
01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
so really talking sort of Alzheimer's
 
01:29:29.629 --> 01:29:29.639 align:start position:0%
and Dementia 101 uh the Baseline in
 
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
terms of where we're at a snapshot in
 
01:29:34.510 --> 01:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
the state and trends that we're seeing
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
and then perspectively the uh subsequent
 
01:29:40.430 --> 01:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
presentation in February would be um
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
from a geriatrician who is providing
 
01:29:45.629 --> 01:29:45.639 align:start position:0%
care in the state and so the the
 
01:29:47.950 --> 01:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
clinical view that they're seeing and so
 
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
what we're really trying to do is based
 
01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
on the charges set out statuto for the
 
01:29:55.149 --> 01:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh solicit information and
 
01:29:57.390 --> 01:29:57.400 align:start position:0%
input and presentations from those
 
01:30:00.430 --> 01:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
various entities to inform our work and
 
01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately as required in the statute to
 
01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
update the state uh plan on
 
01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's let me put a little push
 
01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
since um it is Alzheimer's and other
 
01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
types of dementia Max languished for a
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
number of years with parkinsonia
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
dementia which presents very similarly
 
01:30:20.430 --> 01:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
but it's a little different and just
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
don't want that sub category to be
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
ignored no absolutely not and I didn't
 
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
mean to imply that you didn't I and I
 
01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
didn't even infer it's just got that
 
01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:33.719 align:start position:0%
applying for um I just wanted to bring
 
01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:35.639 align:start position:0%
it up thank you yes absolutely I'm so
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
sorry for that no I'm fine any questions
 
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
thoughts you know if you don't say more
 
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%

[Laughter]
 
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
so yes please I don't think any
 
01:30:53.910 --> 01:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
anybody's going to object to us actually
 
01:30:57.229 --> 01:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
