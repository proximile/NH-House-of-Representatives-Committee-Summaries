00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
just to
 
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.670 align:start position:0%
just to

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
a couple of
 
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
based on venue availability
 
00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
the next session is going to be moved up
 
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
to the week of the 14th of february
 
00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 align:start position:0%
don't have a date yet don't have a time
 
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
or a place
 
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.710 align:start position:0%
 
when

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
aaron and
 
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
the speaker were out looking for a place
 
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
they couldn't find it
 
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't find one for the week
 
00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
that we had um
 
00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.190 align:start position:0%
that we had um
the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
that was scheduled so
 
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
and we decided they decided that it
 
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't good in the middle of winter to
 
00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 align:start position:0%
meet outside
 
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
so you're quite you're quite welcome
 
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
what that means is that um
 
00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 align:start position:0%
all of the bills that are going to
 
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
second committee
 
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
are now moved up a week
 
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
okay for and
 
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
i think they told me there were 102
 
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
that are currently out there
 
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh
 
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of them will
 
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
not pass muster so
 
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
because i i certainly don't want to be
 
00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
faced with
 
00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.350 align:start position:0%
faced with
102

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
102
 
00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
no that's total second committees but as
 
00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 align:start position:0%
you know we get about 75 of them so
 
00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 align:start position:0%
okay so that's just for your um
 
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
for your planning purposes
 
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is um
 
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
written testimony where the person
 
00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't come in
 
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:57.439 align:start position:0%

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
i will
 
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.670 align:start position:0%
i will
ask

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%

then we will
 
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
need to
 
00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 align:start position:0%

newspapers anyhow
 
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
that the ag's office is

conducting a broad
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
criminal investigation
 
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
into the allegations of sexual abuse
 
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
at the youth development center now

known as the sununu center
 
00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 align:start position:0%
these allegations span multiple decades
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
and it has been publicly reported
 
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
that hundreds of individuals have come
 
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.670 align:start position:0%
that hundreds of individuals have come
forward

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.140 align:start position:0%
stating that they were
 
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.390 align:start position:0%
stating that they were
[Music]

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
victims of sexual abuse
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
while they were incarcerated
 
00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:57.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
is here
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
to provide an option
 
00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
for the victims
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
none of the victims
 
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
need to go through this process
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
however they can choose to go through
 
00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:30.230 align:start position:0%
the process
of

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
going to trial
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
and if we have hundreds
 
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
of trials
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
this unfortunately
 
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
will no doubt go on for years and years
 
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
so the process that we have identified
 
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.790 align:start position:0%
so the process that we have identified
here

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
is a way to
 
00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:56.790 align:start position:0%
is a way to
provide

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.550 align:start position:0%
provide
compensation

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.510 align:start position:0%
for the
victims

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
victims
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
without bogging down the court system
 
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
if they choose to go this way
 
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.189 align:start position:0%
if they choose to go this way
it's

00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:10.550 align:start position:0%
it's
absolutely

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.029 align:start position:0%
 
choice

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh we have had
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
several people
 
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
that have worked on
 
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
putting this
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
bill together
 
00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:28.629 align:start position:0%
bill together

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:34.959 align:start position:0%
many changes from the original until
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
what we see here
 
00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:38.630 align:start position:0%
what we see here
and

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.630 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
for those of you
 
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
we also
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
have an amendment
 
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.470 align:start position:0%
have an amendment
220167

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%
did janet distribute that
 
00:08:55.519 --> 00:08:56.790 align:start position:0%
did janet distribute that
okay

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
that will will if people agree to it
 
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
then obviously that will become part of
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
in an effort
 
00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:12.949 align:start position:0%
in an effort
to

00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.630 align:start position:0%
make sure
that

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.230 align:start position:0%
that
this

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.750 align:start position:0%
this
process

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
division 3 and division 1
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
will be holding a work session on
 
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.430 align:start position:0%
will be holding a work session on
wednesday

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
wednesday
 
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.949 align:start position:0%
wednesday
to

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
go through i guess the term is with a
 
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
fine-tooth comb
 
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
what we hear today
 
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.990 align:start position:0%
what we hear today
and

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
what we think is the best thing for
 
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
the uh the victims
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
i will point out that um
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
as we
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
the reason the the reason we set up this
 
00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:01.519 align:start position:0%
work session as division one and
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
division two or division three excuse me
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
because division one handles the ag's
 
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.190 align:start position:0%
because division one handles the ag's
office

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
and division three
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
handles the sununu center
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
so it needed to be
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
a combination
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
of the two
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
divisions to try to come up with
 
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
at the end
 
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.590 align:start position:0%
at the end
so

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's all i have
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
unless um
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
she didn't hear you is your button down
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
my button down my mouth's not opening
 
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:55.269 align:start position:0%
my button down my mouth's not opening
okay

00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
sad okay okay um i'm just gonna ask you
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
three questions today i'll hold the
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
others but um the first is
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
why um
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
did you have the date that this is they
 
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.470 align:start position:0%
did you have the date that this is they
can

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
people that were victims as of 1980 or
 
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
after 1980
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
um there it's my understanding there are
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
some victims prior to that so i was
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
curious why that date was chosen
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh if you don't mind i will let the
 
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
attorney general answer that question
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
and then the other two are financial
 
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.670 align:start position:0%
and then the other two are financial
ones

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
ones
 
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.750 align:start position:0%
okay um
why

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
the hundred million is
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
a large amount but my guess is that
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
that there would could be more
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
that would be needed
 
00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:41.839 align:start position:0%
and so the question i'll combine the two
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
the question is why the hundred million
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
instead of higher and also my and from
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
looking at my interesting is we're
 
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.829 align:start position:0%
looking at my interesting is we're
capping

00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
capping
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
the amount that could go to any one
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
claimant would be 1.5 million here
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
some of the cases that have come to
 
00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.670 align:start position:0%
some of the cases that have come to
light

00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
light
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
in the media accounts in any way are
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
quite egregious that might
 
00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
actually get
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
larger settlements in other cases so i'm
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
curious as to why you chose those two
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
amounts why the 1.5 and why the 100
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
million okay
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
100 million was chosen
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
because if all of the cases
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
decide to go to court
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
no you know no reasonable
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
assessment of of what that might be and
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
that's why the hundred million
 
00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:37.350 align:start position:0%
that's why the hundred million
okay

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh the 1.5
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
if i remember correctly
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
was because that was the
 
00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.269 align:start position:0%
was because that was the
average

00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
average
 
00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:48.949 align:start position:0%
average
settlement

00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
00:12:48.959 --> 00:12:49.750 align:start position:0%
settlement
for

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.550 align:start position:0%
for
uh

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.150 align:start position:0%
uh
victims

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
victims
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
and i want to thank the honourable
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
members of the finance committee
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
i'll be submitting my written testimony
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
i'm representative pat long
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
representative representing hillsborough
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
district 10 in manchester
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
i speak in support of house bill 1677.
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
i believe that it's important to
 
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
recognize that abuse did take place and
 
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
for those victims to be able to see
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
compensation and matters clarified in
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 1677
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
i also believe that victims may be able
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
to proceed in attaining full or as close
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
to foreclosure to their abuses knowing
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
the state recognizes that those abuses
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
took place
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
i know this committee will review this
 
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
bill with due diligence and submit its
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
best recommendation to the general court
 
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
i have a few areas of the bill which i
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
would like to bring to your attention
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
on page one line two the word may i
 
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
believe it's important
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
to the victims that this body
 
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
acknowledges the abuses did occur
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
however i'm not familiar with legal
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
i believe that our acknowledgement of
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
the abuses is greater in the recovery
 
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
stage for those victims than the
 
00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.310 align:start position:0%
stage for those victims than the
compensation

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
page one line 18 sexual abuse
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
i would ask for consideration of
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
physical abuse and unlawful confinement
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
i realized the time frame of honor after
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
january 1st 1980

before i get to the core of my remarks i

you know first and most importantly i
 
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
want to acknowledge the the difficult
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
emotional and complex topic that this
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
bill addresses and that we're
 
00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.390 align:start position:0%
bill addresses and that we're
discussing

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
discussing
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
um i can't say that i can begin to
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
understand the experiences that that
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
these victims from ydc have gone through
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
that they've suffered and
 
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
and what it's taken for them to both
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
live with those experiences and come
 
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.549 align:start position:0%
live with those experiences and come
forward

00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
to tell their stories
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
i and my team we admire their courage
 
00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.029 align:start position:0%
i and my team we admire their courage
and

00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
we admire their fortitude in coming
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
forward and
 
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
enabling us to look into what happened
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
at ydc over over so many years
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
we sincerely hope that this bill will
 
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
provide an opportunity for healing at
 
00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:29.919 align:start position:0%
least for some of the victims because i
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
really do believe that this this should
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
be a time for healing
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
second i just want to remind the
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
committee that when it comes to this
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
matter in my answering questions
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
it's the unique nature of the attorney
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
general's role that i i sort of
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
fulfill a dual function in the state i'm
 
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
both the chief prosecutor who's
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
responsible for overseeing the
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
investigation prosecution
 
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
of these crimes on the criminal side of
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
our office
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm also the state's chief legal
 
00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
officer who's responsible for defending
 
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
the state against any civil claims that
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
might arise from
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
the same events that we're prosecuting
 
00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.350 align:start position:0%
the same events that we're prosecuting
for

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
i know that can be difficult especially
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
for the public to understand
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
but i just wanted to lay that out
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
because that may constrain me a bit in
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
what i can talk about and what questions
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
i can answer
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
but i will commit to you that i will
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
make every effort to answer all of your
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
questions and in the follow-up work
 
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
sessions that we have
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
we will do our best to get you all of
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
the information you need as you consider
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
representative umberger already
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned it but as many of you know the
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
the office has been conducting a broad
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
criminal investigation into
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
events at the youth development center
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
or ydc since 2019
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
to date that's resulted in the
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
indictment of 11 individuals
 
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
for acts of abuse committed against 20
 
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.270 align:start position:0%
for acts of abuse committed against 20
victims

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
victims
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
the reality is that we've had to this
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
date over 400 individuals come forward
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
and the investigation and prosecution of
 
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
crimes related to these allegations will
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
take many years
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's our commitment to to look into
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
the stories that that we hear from every
 
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.430 align:start position:0%
the stories that that we hear from every
individual

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
and to do that right that's going to
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
take time
 
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
as we investigate these crimes we are
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
mindful of stats various statutes of
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
limitations and you know no allegations
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
will go
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
uninvestigated before the relevant
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
statute runs as long as that statute
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
limitations has not already run or
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
didn't already run before these events
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
came to our attention
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
while so many have come forward i think
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
the reality is we won't know the full
 
00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.549 align:start position:0%
the reality is we won't know the full
scope

00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
scope
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
of of the harm or or what occurred at
 
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
ydc for some time as we continue to
 
00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.510 align:start position:0%
ydc for some time as we continue to
investigate

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
investigate
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
with all of this in mind
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
my team and i at the department of
 
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.070 align:start position:0%
my team and i at the department of
justice

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
justice
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
as we've as we've looked into these
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
events as we've thought about them
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
we've come to believe and we recommend
 
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.270 align:start position:0%
we've come to believe and we recommend
that

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
um the state
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
develop a claims resolution process that
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
would provide a trauma-informed
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
and victim-centered alternative to the
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
traditional litigation process for
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
victims who would choose that option
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
i think we all know that the traditional
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
litigation process can be incredibly
 
00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.710 align:start position:0%
litigation process can be incredibly
difficult

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
it's especially difficult for
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
victims of sexual abuse and even more
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
difficult for victims who were children
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
at the time that they suffered that
 
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.590 align:start position:0%
at the time that they suffered that
abuse

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
i'm going to i want to give you a little
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
overview of the bill and i'm happy to
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
answer questions at least an overview
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
from our perspective but i want to start
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
by confirming what this bill is not and
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
i think representative umberger already
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
hit that well
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
the bill is not intended to set up an
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
exclusive process by which victims must
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
go through to pursue compensation
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
it's intended to provide an option
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
so a more victim-friendly and
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed option
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
but even if this bill were to be enacted
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
any victim would have the option of
 
00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
pursuing the traditional litigation
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
process and pursuing their their claims
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.510 align:start position:0%
 
second

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
and this hits to
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
one of representative long's comments at
 
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
least as drafted the bill is not
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
intended to
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
cover any category of abuse that someone
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
may have suffered at ydc
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
it provides an alternative path for
 
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
victims of sexual abuse
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
for other types of harms the bill would
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
not prevent a victim from going through
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
the court process
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
and and i will be happy to answer
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
that question in more detail but i'll
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
just say initially that
 
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
the reason
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
our initial recommendation was to cover
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
we we have seen throughout history
 
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
claims of physical abuse and excessive
 
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
force in prison settings
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
and and there's no question that type of
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
abuse is abhorrent and
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
and someone may come forward with a
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
claim of that abuse what we have not
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
confronted at least in the history of
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
our state is this type of scope
 
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
of sexual abuse in a prison setting and
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
especially a youth incarceration setting
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
and from my perspective it's
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
it's that
 
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
those extraordinary circumstances that
 
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.830 align:start position:0%
those extraordinary circumstances that
warrant

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
a unique and extraordinary um response
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
and in a different process or at least
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
an option for a different process
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
that said that's certainly a component
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
of this bill that we are happy to have
 
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
further discussions on and answer
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
questions on and and while that might be
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
our recommendation the decision will
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
ultimately be up to you but i wanted to
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
give you an initial sense of our
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
thinking on that topic
 
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
overall representative umberger already
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
hit this but but the bill provides an
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
initial appropriation of 100 million
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
dollars to to the ydc settlement fund
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
and the goal would be to fund
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
claims that would be paid out through
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
the process that the bill lays out
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
the hundred million dollars is not
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
intended i i don't think to be a cap
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
the bill specifically contemplates that
 
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
the attorney general may need to come
 
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
back to the legislature to request
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
additional funds to pay all claims in
 
00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:07.510 align:start position:0%
additional funds to pay all claims in
full

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
full
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
but the hundred million dollars is
 
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
intended to be a set aside for now
 
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.190 align:start position:0%
intended to be a set aside for now
and

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
until we have really
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
seen the full scope i think of what the
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
financial impact would be under this
 
00:24:18.559 --> 00:24:20.149 align:start position:0%
financial impact would be under this
process

00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
the bill creates a one-year window in
 
00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.430 align:start position:0%
the bill creates a one-year window in
which

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
victims would have the opportunity to
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
come forward and it really wouldn't be
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
until the end of that one year period
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
and until we've gone through
 
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.630 align:start position:0%
and until we've gone through
the

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
the verification and investigation and
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
and the claims negotiation and payout
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
process that we would we would know the
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
full financial impact of this bill so
 
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
that that's where the 100 million dollar
 
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
number i think from my perspective comes
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
the 1.5 million dollar cap and i'm happy
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
to talk about this in further detail as
 
00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.190 align:start position:0%
to talk about this in further detail as
well

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
that is a result of the research that
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
that we have done in our office
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
of past comparable claims or past
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
comparable cases verdicts and
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
settlements in other cases with
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
with similar facts
 
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
as i say that i do want to acknowledge
 
00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.590 align:start position:0%
as i say that i do want to acknowledge
that

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
you know it's important to remember that
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
every victim has their own story and and
 
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
we really don't want to lose sight of
 
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
seeing each victim for for the
 
00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.710 align:start position:0%
seeing each victim for for the
individual

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances of what they experienced
 
00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.430 align:start position:0%
circumstances of what they experienced
and

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
and what the impact has been on them
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
that said you know when we think about a
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
mass resolution of this type i think the
 
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
best the best information we have to at
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
least construct a broad process is to
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
look at comparable cases that have
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
happened in recent years so the 1.5
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
million dollar number
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
we think that number would allow us to
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
design a process that
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
would result in claims that are
 
00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
consistent with the national average
 
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
that we've calculated in comparable
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
cases which is between which
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
comes out to about five hundred thousand
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
five hundred fifty thousand dollars per
 
00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.590 align:start position:0%
five hundred fifty thousand dollars per
claimant

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
claimant
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
obviously some claimants would be below
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
that number some would be above it but
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
that that's that's the overall average
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
and so that's what we used when we were
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
trying to calculate this 1.5 million
 
00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.269 align:start position:0%
trying to calculate this 1.5 million
dollar

00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
00:26:15.279 --> 00:26:17.669 align:start position:0%
dollar
cap

00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
the bill as as chairman umber
 
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned it would require a publication
 
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
process so notice would go out to
 
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.909 align:start position:0%
process so notice would go out to
everyone

00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
who may have a potential claim or we
 
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
would do our best to provide notice to
 
00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.710 align:start position:0%
would do our best to provide notice to
everyone

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
the bill covers claimants with
 
00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:33.919 align:start position:0%
allegations from 1980 through the
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
present this gets to representative
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
rogers question
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
we picked this date for a couple reasons
 
00:26:41.039 --> 00:26:42.630 align:start position:0%
we picked this date for a couple reasons
one

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
just the basic idea that i think there
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be some date at which we we
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
have a cut off
 
00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.669 align:start position:0%
have a cut off
1980

00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
1980
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
i think there's room for discussion on
 
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
what what this date would be but 1980 is
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
the best rough date we could come up
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
with based on what i've seen on the
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
criminal side and where
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
what i
 
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
based on that information what i've seen
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
is kind of where these where these
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
events and allegations focused around
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue to get more
 
00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
information through the civil process
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure we'll have get more
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
information as we now discuss this bill
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
publicly and have folks testify so i i
 
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
certainly think there's room for
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
discussion around that date but that's
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
that's how we came up with the date of
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
1980 i'm best informed by what i've seen
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
on the criminal investigation which i'm
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
somewhat constrained to what i can talk
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
about but
 
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
1980s is really where where that date
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
came from but as we get more information
 
00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:37.039 align:start position:0%
on the civil side i think we probably
 
00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
warrants further discussion
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
another issue that i'm sure will warrant
 
00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:44.559 align:start position:0%
discussions that the bill permits
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
any claim to be paid out in annual
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
installments of up to 10 years
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
important piece there is that that that
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
is that does not mean that
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
a claim has to be paid out over 10 years
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's an option
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
so there may be instances in which
 
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
someone would prefer that there may also
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
be instances in which that's part of the
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
negotiation between
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
the fund administrator and the claimant
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
it may also be a factor for an
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
arbitrator as as they're looking at the
 
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
claim in front of them and they're
 
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:14.950 align:start position:0%
claim in front of them and they're
deciding

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
deciding
 
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
how to structure an award and how to pay
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
it out so that
 
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.750 align:start position:0%
it out so that
that's

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
that's what the thinking is regarding
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
the installments that's not meant to be
 
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
a requirement that all claims are paid
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
out in installments of 10 years
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh we can go into this in more detail if
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
there are questions maybe in the work
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
session but the bill sets out
 
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
a procedure for making and filing and
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
reviewing and investigating and paying
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
out claims
 
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.870 align:start position:0%
out claims
um

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
that's our best attempt to con i think
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
lay out broad parameters for a process
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
that we think would allow for a
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed and victim-centered
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
process but we are certainly open to
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
to more feedback on that and and
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
obviously the ultimate decision is going
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
to rest with with you is the elective
 
00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%
elected representatives but
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
this reflects our best recommendations
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
and we are here at your service to
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
continue to continue discussing those
 
00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.149 align:start position:0%
continue to continue discussing those
points

00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a high-level overview of
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
the bill i'm sure there are points i've
 
00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:13.039 align:start position:0%
missed but i will take any questions you
 
00:29:13.039 --> 00:29:13.909 align:start position:0%
missed but i will take any questions you
have

00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
before i close i just want to make
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
a couple of additional points
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
i think the most important part of the
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
reasons behind this bill is that we we
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
believe designing and implementing this
 
00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
type of a claims resolution resolution
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
process that provides an option for
 
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.389 align:start position:0%
process that provides an option for
victims

00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
victims
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
is just simply the right thing to do
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
and it's what new hampshire does we i
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
think we we do the right thing we make
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
our best attempt to do the right thing
 
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
it's the right thing for victims
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
who should have an alternative option
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
that provides for faster and gentler
 
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
resolution than the traditional
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
litigation process
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
and i firmly believe it's the right
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
thing for the state
 
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
not only because it constitutes a
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
recognition of the harm that these
 
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
victims have suffered
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
but it directs the state's resources
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
towards healing and compensation
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
rather than costly litigation and it
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
also does provide a level of certainty
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
to the state regarding the financial
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
risk or at least it could if victims
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
elect this option
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
all that said we as i've mentioned
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
before we we do not yet know the full
 
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
extent of the financial potential
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
second i think i've already hit this but
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
i want to make this point
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
we put a lot of work into this proposal
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
we put a lot of thought into this
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
proposal i know we've already worked
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
with legislators of both parties
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
but we recognize that the public process
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
and the legislative process now is just
 
00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.350 align:start position:0%
and the legislative process now is just
beginning

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
so we're eager to engage with
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's council we're either too
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
eager to engage with advocacy groups
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
we're eager to make ourselves available
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
to you to answer questions and assist
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
we're eager to have conversations with
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
with victims themselves if they so chose
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
to get feedback on this bill
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
and to
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
develop the best possible product that
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
we can while balancing at least from the
 
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
perspective of my office our obligations
 
00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.509 align:start position:0%
perspective of my office our obligations
to

00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
and the last thing i will i'll just
 
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
commit to is that if this bill is
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
enacted and
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
the attorney general
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
is authorized to design this type of
 
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.549 align:start position:0%
is authorized to design this type of
process

00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
we will do everything possible to design
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
a process that is as victim-friendly and
 
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:34.630 align:start position:0%
a process that is as victim-friendly and
trauma-informed

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
that's what this is about
 
00:31:39.679 --> 00:31:40.470 align:start position:0%
that's what this is about
so

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
just to close i want to thank you for
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
your time and thank you for for
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
considering this
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
and i also just want to say that
 
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
you know just the fact that legislators
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
were willing to bring this forward makes
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
me very proud
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
it makes me proud of the state
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
it makes me proud that
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
we are willing to acknowledge some of
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
the terrible events that have happened
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
that we're willing to have these
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
conversations that we're willing to make
 
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
an effort to atone
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
and that we're willing to make an effort
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
to bring this much needed relief
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
to our fellow citizens
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm happy to answer
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
questions and we will be available at
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
every work session we will be available
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
anytime you you need to speak with us as
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
we work on this bill
 
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:38.549 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
red okay
 
00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
well anyways thank you mr chair and
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your effort towards this
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
um unimaginable
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
circumstance that's been created
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
i heard the number of 20 that's being i
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
guess litigated now up to 400 is that is
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
that a minimum
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
maximum and
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
along with that why i'm thinking about
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
that is i have no earthly idea how you
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
can place
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
a value
 
00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
to the harm done
 
00:33:06.799 --> 00:33:07.590 align:start position:0%
to the harm done
in

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
this horrible
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
acts and
 
00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:11.669 align:start position:0%
acts and
um

00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:11.679 --> 00:33:12.470 align:start position:0%
um
what

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
do you have a sense of minimum maximum
 
00:33:14.399 --> 00:33:15.430 align:start position:0%
do you have a sense of minimum maximum
or

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.230 align:start position:0%
or
what

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
briefly if this is appropriate now uh
 
00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:20.559 align:start position:0%
what's the process to
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
obtain a value
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
for harm done if if it is that a fair
 
00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.310 align:start position:0%
for harm done if if it is that a fair
question

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
yeah very fair question i i think
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
there's a couple questions in there yes
 
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
i'll try to hit them all and if i don't
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
yes so i think your first question was
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
to the the number of cases
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
and i want to make sure i clarify that
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
on the criminal side we have so far
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
indicted 11 individuals for acts against
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
20 victims that's on the criminal side
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
um i think we all need to keep in mind
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
that there's a much higher burden as we
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
know on the criminal side we are only
 
00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
going to bring bring a charge if we
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
think we can prove a case beyond a
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable doubt and these these are
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
very difficult cases because
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh for a number of reasons but
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
these are always difficult cases in
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
general but these are many of these
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
cases are very old many years ago
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
we don't have the best records
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
memories fade
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
victims of abuse and i'm not an expert
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
on this so i don't want to pretend to be
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
but i i understand that that victims of
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
abuse as years go by
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
don't always have the clearest memory of
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
what happened so so as we try to put
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
these cases together it's very difficult
 
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.589 align:start position:0%
these cases together it's very difficult
to

00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
to put together a criminal case that we
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
can prove beyond a reasonable doubt so
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
while we have indicted 11 individuals
 
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
for acts against 20 victims
 
00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:46.839 align:start position:0%
and we're certainly not done
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
investigating you know the
 
00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:52.079 align:start position:0%
the number 20 on the criminal side i
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
think we should think about is as a
 
00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
different category
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
on the civil side we we've had over four
 
00:34:59.829 --> 00:34:59.839 align:start position:0%
and this has been publicly reported at
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
this point i mean we've had over 450
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
individuals come forward and they have
 
00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
spoken with our
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
our team on the criminal side and
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
they've also we've also gotten their
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
names on on the civil side
 
00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.270 align:start position:0%
names on on the civil side
so

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
that's the number as of now
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the maximum number is
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
i i i couldn't tell you because of that
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
we've had thousands of of you
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
young people at ydc over the years so i
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
don't know what the maximum is but but
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
to date we've had
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
between 4 and 450 who we know of that
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
have come forward but we continue to
 
00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:38.310 align:start position:0%
have come forward but we continue to
investigate

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
investigate
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
and we will continue to do so for some
 
00:35:39.839 --> 00:35:40.710 align:start position:0%
and we will continue to do so for some
time

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
as to the value how we would design a
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
value i spoke about the the overall
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
number of 1.5 million
 
00:35:49.119 --> 00:35:50.230 align:start position:0%
number of 1.5 million
the

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
the way we would design the process and
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
we would seek input from
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
from victims attorneys we seek input
 
00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
from advocacy groups but we would
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
probably end up
 
00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.470 align:start position:0%
probably end up
with

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
some type of matrix
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
that was based on amounts that have been
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
paid out for certain types of harm in
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
the past
 
00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
to your to the question you asked
 
00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079 align:start position:0%
representative or the comment you made
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
is to you don't know how you could value
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
this type of harm i mean i agree you
 
00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:18.950 align:start position:0%
this type of harm i mean i agree you
know

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.750 align:start position:0%
know
it

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
there's no amount of money
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
i think that that really truly
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
compensates for this type of harm
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
that that that's just a fact i can't
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
like i said i can't imagine the horrors
 
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
that some have experienced and
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
and so there's no
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
i think there's no dollar amount that
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
would ever fully compensate someone
 
00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:41.990 align:start position:0%
would ever fully compensate someone
the

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
the best we can do i think is to
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
look at what's been done in the past try
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
to pull from best practices try to
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
try to design something that's fair
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
and that provides
 
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.630 align:start position:0%
and that provides
enough

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
so that a victim
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
feels that they
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
they've received some measure of justice
 
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
enough so that it makes a difference in
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
their lives and helps
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
help helps aid them in some healing and
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
and i think we can i think there's also
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
value in the fact that we would be
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that this happened
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
and we would be listening and and um
 
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
helping a victim to feel heard
 
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
so but there's no
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
dollar amount that i i think we could
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
ever land on no matter how high
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
that we could truly say it's enough
 
00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i think
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
walls thank you mr chairman
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
um so as i recall and i don't have the
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
data but i'm doing this from memory many
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
of the settlements in the catholic
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
church cases were in excess of a million
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
for those victims
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
and those were not violent rapes
 
00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
according to the news reports that i
 
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
read in the paper and that's all i have
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
for this is many of the
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
rapes at the youth detention center were
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
quite violent with
 
00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:07.990 align:start position:0%
quite violent with
the

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
guards holding people down and violent
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
rape sometimes it sounds like with
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
multiple perpetrators involved
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
a much more onerous crime in some i mean
 
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
rapist or nurse no matter what but it
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
would seem to me and the law i think
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
recognizes that violent rapes are even
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
more onerous than non-violent rapes in
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
the same way
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
and and i'm getting into very dangerous
 
00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:31.990 align:start position:0%
and and i'm getting into very dangerous
territory

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
territory
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
at any rate what i'm trying to suggest
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
is is if
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
people in those cases were getting a
 
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
million why is 1.5 million adequate when
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
potentially the the rapes were so much
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
more onerous at the sununu center and
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if we're comparing apples
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
to oranges here and if we shouldn't be
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
raising that cap of 1.5 million for
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
people who are victimized in such a
 
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
violent manner
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
and i will just say for the record
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
because i know this is public i know all
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
rapes are violent but there are
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
levels of violence and that's what i'm
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
talking about here
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i appreciate
 
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:09.990 align:start position:0%
the question
so

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
based on the research we've done and
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
one thing i should mention we're we're
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
open to if others have more information
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
or or i think folks who are here to
 
00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
testify today have additional
 
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
information to provide i mean we we want
 
00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
to see it too but
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
based on the research we've done i'm not
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
sure that at least the
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
the church cases in this state were over
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
a million dollars per claimant and we
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
will we will provide this to you
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
our research and i think we have copies
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
we have copies that we can pass out
 
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
but but that's the first point but but
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
to the extent we're wrong on that or or
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
there's information we may not have we
 
00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
we certainly are open to it um
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
but this research doesn't just look at
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
church cases i mean it looks at i think
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
of a wide variety of
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh or at least a
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
a fair number of past cases that that
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
range from
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
instances which
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
may include
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh more violent acts or
 
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
or instances which may be less violent i
 
00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
think to your point it's just very hard
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
to put a definition on that because any
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
you know how do you define violent in
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
the context of
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
someone who's been victimized
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
or a victim of sexual abuse because i
 
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.390 align:start position:0%
or a victim of sexual abuse because i
think

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
any victim would feel that that's quite
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
violent which i which i know you
 
00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.069 align:start position:0%
violent which i which i know you
acknowledge

00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
acknowledge
 
00:40:28.079 --> 00:40:30.470 align:start position:0%
acknowledge
the

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
part of this process is designed to
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
you know start with the victim coming
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
forward and telling us what happened to
 
00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.630 align:start position:0%
forward and telling us what happened to
them

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
we have we have some details on that so
 
00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:43.829 align:start position:0%
we have we have some details on that so
far

00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
far
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
on the criminal side but
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
but there's still a lot of information
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
we we don't have or that we may not have
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
the full story so
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
um the 1.5 million dollar cap is based
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
on all types of cases that we've looked
 
00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.349 align:start position:0%
on all types of cases that we've looked
at

00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
and and that's why we think that
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
that's a number that that makes sense
 
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
to the extent that we
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
we get additional information or
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
additional information is provided to us
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
or provided to you
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
you know i think it's i think it's worth
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
a discussion but
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
but i i think we just want to make sure
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
i think to your point we don't want to
 
00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
be comparing apples to oranges you know
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
we want to be comparing like cases
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
i think we're doing that but to the
 
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
extent that we're not
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
we should continue to have conversation
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
about that but we will provide you our
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
our verdict research and
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
and i think that will show at least why
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
we've come to the number we came to as a
 
00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.430 align:start position:0%
we've come to the number we came to as a
recommendation

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes were you also looking at
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
the massachusetts settlements because i
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
think they are also relevant here are
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
you just looking at the new hampshire
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
settlements no we've looked at
 
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
settlements from all states so um i mean
 
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
i think i think we've focused on the
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
the church settlements in new hampshire
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
but but we've looked at other types of
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
settlements from from various states but
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
the unfortunate reality is that
 
00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse can happen in
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
many different settings we're we were
 
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
trying to focus on settings you know
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
similar to the youth development center
 
00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:19.190 align:start position:0%
similar to the youth development center
where

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
where individuals or youth may be
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
incarcerated or may
 
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
may be in a situation where there's
 
00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:25.839 align:start position:0%
someone in a position of authority who
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
would commit these acts
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering my other
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
questions as well and
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
um for being willing um i'm very
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
supportive of the concept i just have a
 
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
lot of questions about dates
 
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
and numbers so i'm glad that you're
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
willing to um
 
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
talk to us about the date the 1980 date
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
and the amount but the other um
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
time frame that i'm concerned about and
 
00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
i'll go ask you a lot more questions in
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
the work session but you have roughly a
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
year i think it's exactly a year for the
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
i know that a lot of them have come
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
forward already but is
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
it struck me that just a year is a short
 
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
time so is that something also that um
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
we could look at is is maybe
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
expanding that to two years i mean i'm
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
not sure what the time is as with all of
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
this we're all kind of guessing it
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
amounts to dates but i wondered why you
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
picked just one year
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
and if that's something that you think
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
we can look at
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
yep i absolutely think it's something we
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
can look at i think we we were trying to
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
pinpoint a time period that would
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
provide enough time but also
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
have a cut-off date at some point at
 
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
least for for this process only so that
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
we can get to a point where we have a
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
better sense of of the scope of what
 
00:43:51.119 --> 00:43:52.069 align:start position:0%
better sense of of the scope of what
happened

00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
so i but i think from our perspective a
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
year especially given that that year
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
will not even start until september 1 of
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
this year and and there's been a lot of
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
discussion about this we'll continue to
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
have a lot of discussion about this
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
between now and september 1.
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
we felt a year was probably enough time
 
00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.710 align:start position:0%
we felt a year was probably enough time
but

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
that that is
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
that is i think definitely a topic to
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
discuss further because that could
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
certainly be expanded and from my
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
perspective at least for you know from
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
from the perspective giving legal advice
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
to you as the state's elected
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
representatives i wouldn't see a concern
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
with expanding that at all
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes the other only other
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
question i'll probably today just not
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
find us down
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
in the um bill it also has that the
 
00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
claimants would
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
if they accept a settlement go through
 
00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
the process they would waive their
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
rights to
 
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
go to any other forum
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
and against the state
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
or its employees and my concern is the
 
00:44:50.079 --> 00:44:51.190 align:start position:0%
or its employees and my concern is the
employees

00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
if the employees that perpetrated these
 
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%
crimes on folks
 
00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
as we've all said some of them
 
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
are are
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
just or meant most of them are egregious
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
but i'm wondering if there's that's fair
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
to cut the victims off from pursuing
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
actions against the actual perpetrators
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
of the crime be they employees of the
 
00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.750 align:start position:0%
of the crime be they employees of the
state

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
but go after them individually and
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
personally instead of um
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
or in addition to this process and what
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
you're thinking was there i mean it's
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
kind of like we're protecting these
 
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
people that were clearly criminal in
 
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
their actions
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question
 
00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.829 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question
representative

00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:36.079 align:start position:0%
the complaints that have been filed um
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
to the extent they're filed against
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
employees of the state you know they're
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
not just filed against employees who who
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
committed the acts
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
filed against the commissioner file
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
against others
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
for for negligence in in oversight and
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
and the um the running of the facility
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
and the supervision of the facility so
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's really what that
 
00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.190 align:start position:0%
that's really what that
this

00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
this comes from the concept i think the
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
reality that while these complaints name
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
even the individual employees who
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
committed the acts
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
the real defendant that
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
that these complaints are aimed at is
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
the state because it's the state that
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
has the ability to pay out compensation
 
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
i can't speak here off the top of my
 
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
head to say the criminal defendants or
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
the other individuals who are accused of
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
committing these acts but my sense is
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
most of them are would not have the
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
financial means anyway to to pay
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
anything close to what would be adequate
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
compensation especially to multiple
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
victims so
 
00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.069 align:start position:0%
victims so
um

00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
this this would not in any way prevent
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
the state from pursuing criminal charges
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
against those individuals or prevent the
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
victims from participating in in those
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
criminal proceedings in order to allow
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
other questions yes please
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
my question um if this bill passes um
 
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
how will it be administered i know you
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
you designated an administrator will it
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
become um a group within your office who
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
will oversee this and so that we know
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
that this will be handled with the
 
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
utmost dignity and respect for those
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
victims that i cannot believe quite
 
00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:21.910 align:start position:0%
victims that i cannot believe quite
frankly

00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
40 years this has gone on and and
 
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
we're here this morning and it's just
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
very disheartening to hear this
 
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.069 align:start position:0%
very disheartening to hear this
information

00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
um so could you elaborate on that for me
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
please sure
 
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.390 align:start position:0%
please sure
yeah

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
i think the first point on that is the
 
00:47:37.829 --> 00:47:37.839 align:start position:0%
bill is i think designed to to put some
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
parameters in place but that would allow
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
some flexibility so that we could design
 
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
the process the right way but but i
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
think how it would end up playing out or
 
00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
this is close to how it would play out
 
00:47:47.359 --> 00:47:48.150 align:start position:0%
this is close to how it would play out
is

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
as drafted the bill would authorize me
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
as attorney general to designate someone
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
to be the administrator
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
the bill allows for
 
00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
administrative costs to come out of the
 
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.150 align:start position:0%
administrative costs to come out of the
fund

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
but we would use both current personnel
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
and perhaps
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
contracted personnel or others that we
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
hire on a temporary basis to
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
to help administer this so to help
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
take in the claims review them
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
get them investigated interview the
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
claimants uh do that in as
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
trauma-friendly and victim-centered way
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh but but i think to your question yes
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
it would it would be supervised
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately by the attorney general and
 
00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office so that we
 
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
could ensure that it was handled the
 
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
right way
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
and then the arbitrator piece would be
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
in there so that there is a neutral
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
party if the administrator and the
 
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
claimant you know don't come to an
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
agreement on a number within the
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
guidelines it would be submitted to a
 
00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:48.079 align:start position:0%
neutral arbitrator and both sides would
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you

00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh it used to be vicinanzo
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
in naples
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%

that i i spell it 15 times a day on the

phone
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
although i'm not i'm not a total
 
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
stranger to this body
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
um i've been in the state a long time i
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
used to run the u.s attorney's office
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
for many years
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
in fact justice lynn was a mentor of
 
00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:45.750 align:start position:0%
in fact justice lynn was a mentor of
mine

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
mine
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
and a predecessor
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
um but this body actually is a former
 
00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
client of mine the house of
 
00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:52.230 align:start position:0%
client of mine the house of
representatives

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
i represented the house
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
and the last redistricting
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
and in fact this is kind of old home day
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
for me because i remember the last time
 
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
i think i was in front of justice lynn
 
00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
uh looking down at me with that stern
 
00:50:06.559 --> 00:50:07.589 align:start position:0%
uh looking down at me with that stern
uh

00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:07.599 --> 00:50:08.549 align:start position:0%
uh
visage

00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:08.559 align:start position:0%
visage
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
that he has on the bench
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
i'm exaggerating of course
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
but uh in that case we uh we got a
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
unanimous decision from the state
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
supreme court for the first time in two
 
00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:19.670 align:start position:0%
supreme court for the first time in two
decades

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
decades
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
we had put together a house plan of
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
redistricting that the court found was
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional and abided by perfectly
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
with the one person one vote principle
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm very proud of that and and uh i
 
00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
want to note though that you are my
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
former clients
 
00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:37.670 align:start position:0%
former clients
so

00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
well now i have different clients
 
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:40.950 align:start position:0%
well now i have different clients
and

00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
i want to really express my gratitude to
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
we represent we meaning ross reilly and
 
00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.710 align:start position:0%
we represent we meaning ross reilly and
myself

00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
about 450 child victims in this case
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
as of yesterday as of last night we've
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
filed 449
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
lawsuits in merrimack county superior
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
court and
 
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
we regret having to tie up the the
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
superior court and tie up the office of
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
attorney general
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
but our folks have been denied justice
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
for decades
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
and justice is long overdue for them
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
i am so glad we are very grateful
 
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
that the attorney general and
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
this body
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
this huge
 
00:51:33.839 --> 00:51:34.829 align:start position:0%
this huge
grievous

00:51:34.829 --> 00:51:34.839 align:start position:0%
grievous
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
wound on the integrity and the
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
reputation of our great state
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's sort of unbelievable i've begun to
 
00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
really research some of the history
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
of how it could have happened
 
00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:47.829 align:start position:0%
of how it could have happened
how

00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:51:50.309 --> 00:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
it went on for years and never really
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
was examined
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
there were rumors
 
00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:54.470 align:start position:0%
there were rumors
but

00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
i i think sometimes when you have kids
 
00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.950 align:start position:0%
i i think sometimes when you have kids
who's

00:51:58.950 --> 00:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
who's
 
00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
for whom all the adults in their lives
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
have failed them
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
and that are put into a place no parents
 
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
no teachers no
 
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:08.390 align:start position:0%
no teachers no
nobody

00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
nobody
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
no political constituency no real
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
constituency at all to look out for
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
their rights
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
it's very easy to forget them and that's
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
what happened here they were forgotten
 
00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
and they were
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
abused terribly
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
and we have we'll get into this in a
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
moment but
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
we have kids who
 
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
report being
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
raped anally
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
up to 150 times over two two year period
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
while they're incarcerated
 
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's unbelievable became the the sexual
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
playthings of some of these
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
counselors who work there
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh taken from society cut off
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
no parents know anybody and
 
00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
this legislature passed bills years ago
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
saying what should happen
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
these are kids who who's all the adults
 
00:52:59.670 --> 00:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
have failed them but now it's our job to
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
help launch them successfully into
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
adulthood and instead we take these
 
00:53:04.079 --> 00:53:05.190 align:start position:0%
adulthood and instead we take these
sheep

00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
sheep
 
00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
and bring them
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
into the wolf pen
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
and that's what happened here
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
i have another client who a a young
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
woman a woman who
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
14 years old but put in there
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
impregnated by one of these counselors
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
and then two other counselors take her
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
out for a forced abortion i mean you
 
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
can't make this stuff up
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
i apologize for my emotion but
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
i have a lot of kids myself
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
i have an adopted child from mexico
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
and that orphanage
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
did a heck of a lot better job than what
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
we did with ydc
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
and it's a shame on us
 
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
it's a shame and i'm so grateful for
 
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
i apologize
 
00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:12.470 align:start position:0%
i apologize
so

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
but i'm very grateful to hear john say
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
that it's time for the state to do the
 
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
right thing
 
00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
and it absolutely is
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
this should not be cannot be anything
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
like what the catholic church did when
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
the scandals started to emerge
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know you had the cardinal law
 
00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
approach which is oh
 
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
you know we don't really want to hear
 
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
about this when we're doing so many
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
great things today that we can't afford
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
to take care of all these these
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
things in the past we can't afford it oh
 
00:54:44.069 --> 00:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
well we saw what happened with cardinal
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
law how well that worked out for him
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
but there was a much more progressive
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
and much more liberal minded open-minded
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
approach that was taken
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
by others
 
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
cardinal o'malley was one of them and he
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
said look at we have no credibility
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
we have we have no right to do anything
 
00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
until we take care of these past debts
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
until we take care of the children who
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
are harmed in our care by our own people
 
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
who's going to listen to you
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
if you don't do that
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
and he was right and and to a large
 
00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:17.190 align:start position:0%
and he was right and and to a large
extent

00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
extent
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
fair amount of justice that was done to
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
the church's credit it's not always but
 
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
some a lot of times
 
00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:27.430 align:start position:0%
some a lot of times
um

00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
we oppose the bill
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
not in concept but the way it's written
 
00:55:35.549 --> 00:55:35.559 align:start position:0%
we do like the idea of a victim-friendly
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed mediation or arbitration
 
00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:39.190 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed mediation or arbitration
process

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's great that would be great but the
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
way it's written right now
 
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
i you know i've been doing this for
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
years decades working with victims of
 
00:55:50.549 --> 00:55:50.559 align:start position:0%
trauma i still do and i i obviously and
 
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
and i've learned so much one of my
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
former partners is gordon mcdonald
 
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
gordon and i 20 years ago
 
00:55:59.630 --> 00:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
working to get together developed a
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed victim-friendly process
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
for settlement of child sexual abuse
 
00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:06.069 align:start position:0%
for settlement of child sexual abuse
cases

00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
and it's it's it's used very
 
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
successfully even then but it's gotten
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
better over time and it's used all over
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
new england and other parts of the
 
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
country very successfully
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
and we have you know we have a lot of
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
our victims who end at the end of the
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
process say
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
i feel
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
somewhat reconciled with the institution
 
00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
that harm me
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
i feel like i've been validated i feel
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
like i've been heard and i i am
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
this has been really important in my
 
00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:31.349 align:start position:0%
this has been really important in my
healing

00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
healing
 
00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
and i i
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
anyway so this is a well trodden path we
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
don't have to reinvent the wheel here
 
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
what has to happen here already exists
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
and i wish that john and i had an
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk we are going to talk
 
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
next week we i just we haven't we've
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
only met this morning for the first time
 
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
and and i
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
you know i'm very impressed with what i
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
heard him say and i'm confident that
 
00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
that we're going to make some real
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
progress in turning this bill into
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
something that the victims will use
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
because ultimately the product is all
 
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know proof's in the pudding if the
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
if the customers don't use the product
 
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
then the product doesn't work right so
 
00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
we've got to get it to the point where
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
these folks who've been terribly
 
00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:09.510 align:start position:0%
these folks who've been terribly
traumatized

00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
traumatized
 
00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:10.549 align:start position:0%
traumatized
who

00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
didn't try you know learned at an early
 
00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:14.799 align:start position:0%
age not to trust people and do not trust
 
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
the state i hate to say it but they
 
00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:17.829 align:start position:0%
the state i hate to say it but they
don't

00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
um they've got to get to the point where
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
they're actually going to trust the
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
state enough
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
that they'll participate and that
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
they'll feel that they're going to get a
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
fair shake and that is one of the things
 
00:57:29.829 --> 00:57:29.839 align:start position:0%
that i would you know i'm just saying i
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to get into all the things
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
that we disagree with on the current
 
00:57:33.599 --> 00:57:34.390 align:start position:0%
that we disagree with on the current
bill

00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
because i want to focus on the positives
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
and i want to focus on what we're going
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
to do next week when we're working on it
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
and so forth but the idea that somehow
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
the victims have to
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
abandon all their other rights and or as
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
a price of admission to this process
 
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
it's a non-starter they're not going to
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
do that they don't have that level of
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
trust and we don't make them do that in
 
00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
any other i represent other institutions
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
very sophisticated ones
 
00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
and we don't make people do that we
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
don't you know it's it you always have
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
the right to pursue what your your
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
rights in court we don't make people we
 
00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
don't coerce them into giving them up as
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
a price of admission so that's kind of a
 
00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
bit of a faux pas i think i don't i
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
don't think that's going to work and it
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't work because
 
00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
i i think it's malpractice frankly for
 
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
me to recommend that to our clients
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
because these are very strong liability
 
00:58:22.079 --> 00:58:23.109 align:start position:0%
because these are very strong liability
cases

00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
these are not the usual cases this is a
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
situation it's not a negligent
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
supervision case or a negligent hiring
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
case and i i know there are several
 
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
lawyers on the on the panel may
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
understand this
 
00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
talking a little inside baseball here
 
00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:36.710 align:start position:0%
talking a little inside baseball here
but

00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
the state had a fiduciary duty to these
 
00:58:41.349 --> 00:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
kids they took them into custody and cut
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
them off from the rest of the world
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
and undertook to take total control of
 
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
them and care for them
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's different that when that happens
 
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like you know when a lawyer
 
00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:53.839 align:start position:0%
gets a settlement and turns out his
 
00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
secretary steals the money the lawyer
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
can't go to the client and say oh sorry
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
i didn't know my secretary was a
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
criminal i don't owe you any money no no
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
no you owe the money you owe the money
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
there's no free
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
bite there's no
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
there's no trial run if you breach your
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty you oh you're liable
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
the other thing is there's no statute of
 
00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
limitations on sexual assault anymore it
 
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
was abolished by this legislature last
 
00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:19.750 align:start position:0%
was abolished by this legislature last
year

00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
especially with respect to the state
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
not even a bill of rights argument
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
there's no article 1
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
or part 1 article 23 argument there is
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
no statute of limitations and this does
 
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
go back to the point about 1980 i really
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
feel that that's an arbitrary cutoff the
 
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
church paid
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
altar boys that were abused back to the
 
00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.510 align:start position:0%
altar boys that were abused back to the
1940s

00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
1940s
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
just because you're a little bit elderly
 
00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't you have some rights why
 
00:59:47.589 --> 00:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
do you why pick 1980. i just
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
i know we'll talk about that and i think
 
00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
we'll get to the right point on that but
 
00:59:53.109 --> 00:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
i don't think you should discriminate
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
against people just because they're
 
00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:55.190 align:start position:0%
against people just because they're
older

00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
older
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
you know and if they were abused they
 
00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
were abused
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
so that's just one of the new various
 
01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
things the the other thing is the
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
concept of a fund
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
funds i i i'm in the business i'm a
 
01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
lawyer going on 40 years and i i you
 
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
know i i know when they talk about fund
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
it's usually the institution trying to
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
save money and
 
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
and it's particularly pernicious idea in
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
this case where you create a limited pie
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
and i know that may not be the intention
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
and probably isn't what gonna be what
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
eventually resolves here but you create
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
a pie and then you make the victims
 
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
fight for their limited peace
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
that's a horrible image here especially
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
with these victims so you know part of
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
what the state has learned and what
 
01:00:37.349 --> 01:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
we've learned from our clients
 
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
is that there were a lot of times these
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
kids were made to fight
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
by the guards by the counselors they
 
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
used to fight over food you know
 
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
actually fist fights actually have them
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
fight for the entertainment of the
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
guards it's like a it's like a cage
 
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
match you know with these 15 year olds
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
fighting each other and the idea that
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to create a pot
 
01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
or a pie that's limited and all the all
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
these traumatized people have to fight
 
01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
each other for their little slice
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
no that is not a good very bad image
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
very bad image and again something that
 
01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:08.630 align:start position:0%
very bad image and again something that
is

01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:01:11.829 --> 01:01:11.839 align:start position:0%
somewhat repellent to to our clients and
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
they're probably not something that's
 
01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:14.559 align:start position:0%
going to work
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
i'm mindful of my time and i don't want
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
to go on too long that we'll have
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak uh next week and
 
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
i'm really looking forward to working
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
with john and and jen
 
01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.270 align:start position:0%
with john and and jen
uh

01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
i had a great conversation with chairman
 
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
umberger yesterday and she i don't think
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
she's here anymore but i have to thank
 
01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:31.750 align:start position:0%
she's here anymore but i have to thank
her

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
her
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry okay thank you again uh
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
chair chairperson umberger
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
but she asked me or invited me to
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
edit the bill
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
in the next few days before the working
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
session which i'm very eager to do
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
and to come to the working group and
 
01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
work with us so that the victims who we
 
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
represent and ultimately who are the
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries and the people that will
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
use this process are adequately
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
represented and that we actually get to
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
hear the victims perspective
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
um i'm also going to probably write a
 
01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:04.069 align:start position:0%
um i'm also going to probably write a
letter

01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
letter
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
with that kind of explaining our
 
01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.190 align:start position:0%
with that kind of explaining our
rationale

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
rationale
 
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
and um also probably presenting
 
01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
what i alluded to earlier the process
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
that gordon mcdonald and i developed 20
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
years ago and is now kind of mainstream
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
i really feel like we don't have to
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
reinvent this wheel
 
01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:23.829 align:start position:0%
reinvent this wheel
um

01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
i do one final thing i think is and it's
 
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
something that is it's already been
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
adequately addressed i think to some
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
degree but the idea of taking
 
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
an average national average of
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
settlements and sort of making that the
 
01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.710 align:start position:0%
settlements and sort of making that the
cap

01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
cap
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
i don't think that makes sense i mean i
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned i alluded to some of the
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
injured folks here and you know there
 
01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
are cases that
 
01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
would uh settle for much less than 1.5
 
01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's a vast there's
 
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
quite a range of of what happened 50
 
01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:52.470 align:start position:0%
quite a range of of what happened 50
times

01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
as a 15 16 year old i don't know how you
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
put a price on that but i did i did just
 
01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
see this uh the grid that was uh put
 
01:02:59.599 --> 01:03:00.710 align:start position:0%
see this uh the grid that was uh put
together

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
and i just scanning it but and i noticed
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that's missing here i mean
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't address the the larry nassar
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
case the more recent stuff you know
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
nassar was the
 
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
usa olympics uh doctor the average
 
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
settlement there was the 1.5 million
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's the average and somewhere much
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
higher and that sort of abuse the abuse
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
there terrible abuse but you know that's
 
01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
a doctor who's exceeding what a doctor
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
is supposed to do with the patient it's
 
01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
not quite the same not the same as 150
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
anal rates i can guarantee you that
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
so so we should i would i would i'll
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
definitely be conveying that to to john
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
and to jen and to others
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
the church settlements more recently we
 
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
allude to some of the diocese
 
01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:42.079 align:start position:0%
settlements but those are 20 years ago
 
01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:43.839 align:start position:0%
and to a large extent before society
 
01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
really realized how much harm is done by
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
this type of abuse
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh the church that settlements in l.a
 
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
more recently are in the 1.3 1.5 million
 
01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:53.910 align:start position:0%
more recently are in the 1.3 1.5 million
average

01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
average
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
and again we don't know it all depends
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
on the facts
 
01:03:59.430 --> 01:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
um brooklyn recently there's the four
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
kids church settlement
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
um the average there was seven million
 
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
now that's brooklyn
 
01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
when i practiced in new york years ago
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
we used to call it the international
 
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
house of plaintiffs
 
01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
but so maybe that maybe the values are
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
higher there but still
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
you know seven isn't 1.5 but it maybe
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
something in between is is something
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
that would be an appropriate one
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh and also the diocese settlements with
 
01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
chuck douglas and um
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
peter hutchins i know because my firm
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
was involved gordon was very involved i
 
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
had a front row seat
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
through not just 20 years ago but
 
01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
until gordon took the bench or or became
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
a g i'm sorry but those those
 
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
settlements have risen dramatically over
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
the years they were uh at the time
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
society that not had a had much
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
experience with sexual abuse and i think
 
01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
those were very much undervalued they
 
01:04:48.789 --> 01:04:48.799 align:start position:0%
also don't include mark abramson
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
settlements which were significantly
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
higher or any of the settlements since
 
01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839 align:start position:0%
there had been a lot of settlements
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
since they just haven't surfaced in the
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
public eye but the values now are much
 
01:04:57.839 --> 01:04:58.870 align:start position:0%
public eye but the values now are much
higher

01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
higher
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
i i really am very grateful for the
 
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak today i'm i'm sorry
 
01:05:06.789 --> 01:05:06.799 align:start position:0%
if i'm taking too much time i'm grateful
 
01:05:07.829 --> 01:05:07.839 align:start position:0%
for your
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
you're uh allowing me to speak uh a
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
little bit more i have plenty more to
 
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
say and i'll save it for
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
my writings and for next week
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
i just want to leave you with this
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
thought and and i am reiterating it but
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
it's so important
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
the our clients these victims were kids
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
they had been failed by all the adults
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
and then they're placed in custody and
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
abused physically sexually in other ways
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
they learned early on not to trust
 
01:05:35.589 --> 01:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
anybody and they have a one of their
 
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
problems is they go to therapy and the
 
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
therapists will say
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
you have a big problem with trust you
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
don't trust anybody that's why you're
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
you're a walking porcupine you know
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
you're scared of everything you're you
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
have ptsd a lot of them have ptsd
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
they don't trust people and they
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
especially they sort of think of the
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
state as one big entity they don't make
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
a distinction between the ag and hhs or
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
ydc it's all the same
 
01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:01.839 align:start position:0%
so in order to actually get them to use
 
01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
this process
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
we've got to try to get into their shoes
 
01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit and see the world a little
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
bit the way they see it
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
and so in order to make this bill
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
attractive and i do think it's an
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
important thing to do to have an
 
01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
alternative i think all of these cases
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
ought to be mediated or arbitrated in
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
some way nobody wants to clog up the
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
courts forever and nobody knows what a
 
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
jury will do with these i mean you know
 
01:06:26.789 --> 01:06:26.799 align:start position:0%
we are waking up to the how much harm
 
01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse in my on children it does
 
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
nobody wants that so i we want this to
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
work too but we have to remember who
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
your customer is here and
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
that's the victims so we've got to make
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
it appealing to them
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
and there is already a time-tested and
 
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
well-developed path that we can go down
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
and i want i look forward to the
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to share my experience with
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
john and with jen and others and and the
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
committee and the legislature generally
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much and
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
i'm very grateful for the opportunity to
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
be here happy to take any questions if
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
you have some
 
01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
knowing that we're going to have a full
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
work session next week
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
if you have any any questions you'd like
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
to ask or
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
i would prefer you wait until the work
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
session so we have a chance to review
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
your remarks i'm assuming we'll get some
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
kind of markup yes on the bill itself
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%
uh so does anybody have any questions
 
01:07:20.799 --> 01:07:21.589 align:start position:0%
uh so does anybody have any questions
that

01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:26.799 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
oh sure yeah it's v like vector i
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
c i
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
n a n z o this in nonzone it's actually
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
pretty fanatic
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
it just if you angle size it
 
01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
and imagine that i've got 10 sons they

01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
01:08:37.110 --> 01:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is lynn chalette
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm the executive director of the
 
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire coalition against domestic
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
and sexual violence
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
it's a tall order to speak after the
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
attorney general and david vissenanzo
 
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
and many good points have been made this
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
morning so i can be very brief
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the forward momentum to
 
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
recognize the lifelong impact of severe
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
abuse that children received at the
 
01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
hands of the state-run facilities were
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
talking about today
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
and we are happy to hear that the
 
01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
attorney general is willing to continue
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
conversations about this piece of
 
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
the state has failed these children in
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
horrible horrible ways and it's our
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
obligation to make it right
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative walls i think you asked
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
some interesting questions about
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
different kinds of rape and i think one
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
of the things that's important for us to
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
focus on here is that children who are
 
01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
raped in institutions face added layers
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
of consequences
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
in addition to the physical and
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
psychological abuse they've experienced
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
they have experienced an unspeakable
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
violation of trust by an institution an
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
institution that had a single mission
 
01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
which was to raise them in a safe
 
01:09:38.239 --> 01:09:39.590 align:start position:0%
which was to raise them in a safe
environment

01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
environment
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
so the coalition is supportive of
 
01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
victims being compensated for the
 
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
injuries they've experienced and the
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
care that they have sought
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
we know that survivors of childhood
 
01:09:50.709 --> 01:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse have major financial
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
implications throughout their life
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
needing medical care mental health care
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
and they often often experience losses
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
in the educational setting and the
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
inability to keep jobs
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
a number of questions came up today
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
about the appropriate time frame of here
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
the tragedy is that with the passage of
 
01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
time many of these consequences become
 
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
worse and survivors actually need more
 
01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.590 align:start position:0%
worse and survivors actually need more
care

01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
that being said we believe there's more
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
work to be done for this bill to create
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
a process that is inclusive of fair to
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
and empowers victims
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
victims need a trauma-informed response
 
01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
to help them heal and the financial
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
component is part of it but you also
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
heard the attorney general and mr
 
01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
vicinanzo speak to the fact that
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
engaging victims in a meaningful way is
 
01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.669 align:start position:0%
engaging victims in a meaningful way is
important

01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
so we're optimistic about the work
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
session next week as well i would say
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
briefly that our concerns about the bill
 
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
fall into three buckets or three
 
01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.229 align:start position:0%
fall into three buckets or three
categories

01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
categories
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
first and most importantly it's critical
 
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
for victims to have options in the
 
01:10:51.669 --> 01:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
process that will make them whole
 
01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
we don't believe that victims who engage
 
01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
in this process should be denied the
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
ability to go to court if they get to
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
the end of this process and it doesn't
 
01:10:59.430 --> 01:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
help them or they don't get any
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
compensation we believe they should be
 
01:11:03.669 --> 01:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
able to retain that option
 
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
we have great concerns about the
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
financial cap we do believe that puts
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
victims in competition with one another
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
and that is not a trauma
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
response to what they experienced
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
and as representative long referenced
 
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
earlier we think the notice provisions
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
are impractical
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
and far too short so there are some
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
practical things like that we hope the
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
committee will work on
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
the second bucket is some process
 
01:11:25.679 --> 01:11:26.790 align:start position:0%
the second bucket is some process
concerns

01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
the investigator and the administrator
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
are very linked in this process and we
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
believe those should be independent
 
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
entities we also have concerns about the
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
10-year payout period
 
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
finally our third bucket is about the
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
scope of this bill and several of these
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
issues have been raised today
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
it is narrow in terms of the
 
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
institutions that are covered we believe
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
it should look at all the state
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
institutions that have been involved in
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
perpetrating and covering up this abuse
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
it is narrow in terms of the crimes that
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
are covered for a victim who is beaten
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
one day and the next day has something
 
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
inserted into their body as a form of
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
sexual assault those traumas are
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
overlapping i don't think there's a
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
distinction for survivors who experience
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
these patterns of abuse over years
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
we also have concerns about the scope of
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
the dates and as i mentioned when we
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
look at survivors who experienced abuse
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
even earlier than this 1980 date what
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
that means is that they have lived with
 
01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
their injuries even longer
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
so we're pleased that the attorney
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
general has committed to make this
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
process more trauma-informed and more
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
victim-centered and we look forward to
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
coming to the table next week and
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
throughout the session to try to make
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
this a process that will truly help
 
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
victims heal thank you i'm happy to take
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:55.350 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your testimony and
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
you mentioned other state agencies could
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
you expand on that
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i i could and i also think that
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
attorney vicenzo is probably the best
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
one to come for to speak to that but we
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
know that over 400 victims have come
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
forward and have identified many other
 
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
institutions in addition to ydc and i'd
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
be happy to put a list together and
 
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
provide it with the commit to the
 
01:13:18.239 --> 01:13:19.350 align:start position:0%
provide it with the commit to the
committee

01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:13:23.189 --> 01:13:23.199 align:start position:0%

our next witness is
laurie

01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:36.390 align:start position:0%
 
ortolano

01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
we do have written testimony from this
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
witness so i'm assuming she's
 
01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:52.790 align:start position:0%
witness so i'm assuming she's
oh

01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is lori ordolano
 
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
i'm the vice president of new hampshire
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
right to know
 
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
and we are opposed to one section of
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
this bill 1677
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
that we're looking for an amendment on
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
and that would be for the non-disclosure
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
of the settlement agreements
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
the right to know law 91a colon 4 says
 
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
that every agreement to settle a lawsuit
 
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
against a governmental unit threatened
 
01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
lawsuit or other claim
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
entered into by any political
 
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
subdivision or its insurer shall be kept
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
on file at a clerk's office and made
 
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
available for public inspection for a
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
period of no less than 10 years
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
from the date of the settlement
 
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's unclear why with these settlements
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
redactions can't be performed on records
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
to protect the names of the individuals
 
01:14:38.239 --> 01:14:39.350 align:start position:0%
to protect the names of the individuals
involved

01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
in nashua school district settlements
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
involving special education or an abuse
 
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
issue in a school
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
are available for inspection but
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
redactions are done and they also use
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
the family educational right protection
 
01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
act ferpa regulations to protect the
 
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
privacy rights of
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
the student
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
the distribution of governmental funds
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
to settle these lawsuits should not be
 
01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
withheld from the public and in
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
listening today it looks like this is
 
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
certainly an evolving bill
 
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
in the scope of it and the amount of it
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
and the number of victims
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
we're looking at estimates now and you
 
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
folks are going to be at the table
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
debating this and working on this for
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
some period of time
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
so please do not exempt these records
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
from the existing statute under the
 
01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
right to know law thank you
 
01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
and that concludes the
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
01:15:41.679 --> 01:16:03.350 align:start position:0%
hearing on

01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:19.030 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%

01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
so thank you so much for hearing from us
 
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
today my name is mark pitkin and i
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
represent the economic corporation of
 
01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:58.229 align:start position:0%
represent the economic corporation of
newport

01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
newport
 
01:18:59.910 --> 01:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to be as brief as i can
 
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
because we are in a situation where we
 
01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
are behind or between a rock and a hard
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
place so to give you some perspective as
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
to why this bill is coming forward
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
back in 2006 we had an ash landfill that
 
01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
was owned and operated by 27 districts
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
most in new hampshire some in vermont
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
and then newport not wanting to be
 
01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
considered the trash town and having all
 
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
of this ash basically come forth through
 
01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
town through the entire new england
 
01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:29.590 align:start position:0%
town through the entire new england
states

01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
we worked with the 27 communities and
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
des such that we would be the only
 
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
non-profit entity a landfill to put it
 
01:19:42.189 --> 01:19:42.199 align:start position:0%
in conservation easement and for the
 
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
benefit of the citizens of newport
 
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
so when that originally came into
 
01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
existence through those three folks
 
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
working together
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
because we are not a municipality that
 
01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
has the ability to tax we are not one of
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
the large
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh disposal corporations that have huge
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
balance sheets and we are basically an
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
economic development corporation with a
 
01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
mission that is to improve sort of the
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
betterment of businesses and citizenry
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
in newport
 
01:20:16.149 --> 01:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
um we decided we would move forth and
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
then the des at that point in time
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
required us to have a trust fund so we
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't look to any other type of
 
01:20:24.629 --> 01:20:24.639 align:start position:0%
financial assurance with regards to the
 
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
post-closure expenses over time so a
 
01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
trust fund was put together the monies
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
were put in by the 27 districts and we
 
01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:34.719 align:start position:0%
were successful in getting a permit
 
01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
modification from the state again as
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
being the only non-profit to take on
 
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
this particular and potential project
 
01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:46.719 align:start position:0%
so everything was going well and we
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
provide on a regular basis something
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
called financial assurance so you always
 
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
have to show that you have enough money
 
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
in whatever mechanism you have to cover
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
that landfill for a certain period of
 
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
time so when this agreement was
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
originally put together it was put
 
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
together with the expectation that it
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
was a 30-year period so all of the
 
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
monies that were put in place by those
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
engineers and it was looked at by the
 
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
des that said yes you have put in an
 
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
adequate amount of money to cover this
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
for 30 years
 
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
so we provided financial insurance in a
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
manner that was not questioned by des up
 
01:21:29.590 --> 01:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
until 2016.
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
so from 2006 when we purchased it we did
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
the financial assurance up until 2016.
 
01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
the des changed that regulation so if
 
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
you go back and you look i think it was
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
july 14
 
01:21:50.229 --> 01:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
the regulation changed again we call it
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
a change you're going to see that the
 
01:21:54.629 --> 01:21:54.639 align:start position:0%
des in their written comments indicated
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
that it was a misunderstanding
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
it was a change such that they said no
 
01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:02.719 align:start position:0%
longer is it for a fixed 30-year period
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
now we require you to have that
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
pretty much in a perpetuity for 30 years
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
until we figure out that we can close
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
that landfill
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
so through that 15 years based upon the
 
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
original documentation that we had and
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
we have letters from the then
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner that said
 
01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
economic corporation we are releasing
 
01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
money from the trust fund that we
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
control to allow you to pay expenses
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
based upon the original agreement we
 
01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
allow you to take out this money to
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
cover the remaining 15 years of the
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
30-year requirement and again that was
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
signed by the
 
01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
depart by the commissioner of des
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
so when they changed it to a rolling 30
 
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
years we had already spent fifteen
 
01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:51.430 align:start position:0%
years we had already spent fifteen
thirty

01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
thirty
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
30. so after that legislation was
 
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
changed we could no longer provide
 
01:22:58.470 --> 01:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
financial assurance because the money
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
that we originally had been
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
using given by those districts to take
 
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
ownership and stewardship of the
 
01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:07.110 align:start position:0%
ownership and stewardship of the
landfill

01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't enough to provide another 30
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
years and so the des said we are not
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
going to allow you to take money out of
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
the remaining fund to pay your expenses
 
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
of which we owe 172 thousand dollars to
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
the folks that have been doing the work
 
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
at the landfill for us we are not
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
allowing you to take that money out of
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
that because you need 30 years so you've
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
got to figure out some way to come up
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
with another 15 years of monies well i
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
can tell you as an economic corporation
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
if we would have known that this was a
 
01:23:39.189 --> 01:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
rolling perpetual 30 years we don't have
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
a revenue stream right our money doing
 
01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
and maybe getting someone in and maybe
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
selling it that's how we perpetuate our
 
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
mission our mission was never to hold an
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
ash landfill for life i mean we're all
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
volunteers my day job is a banker so i'm
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
president of sugar river bank which we
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
have i am not i am just learning now how
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
to run a landfill
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
literally and i have to say the des has
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
been very good to work with and we've
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
been working very closely with them as
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
well as novus engineering um but i can
 
01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
tell you that the volunteers around that
 
01:24:17.199 --> 01:24:18.149 align:start position:0%
tell you that the volunteers around that
table

01:24:18.149 --> 01:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
table
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know they question if indeed you
 
01:24:22.709 --> 01:24:22.719 align:start position:0%
know we are going to be held to that
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
when we don't have the money
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know some of the alternatives are
 
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
not great some of the alternatives is we
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
just can't do it so what you're seeing
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
in that bill at this point in time we
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
are asking for an appropriation such to
 
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
fill that gap and for the appropriation
 
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
to go to
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
the department of environmental services
 
01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
such that we have enough to cover not
 
01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:52.719 align:start position:0%
only that 30-year period but hopefully
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
we have enough to cover expenses because
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
not only do we have to take that chunk
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
of money which could be upwards of nine
 
01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
we can't touch that so the dea says
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for having nine
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand vital money which has
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
to stay there for thirty years you
 
01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:08.719 align:start position:0%
cannot touch that that is what has to
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
stay there in order to cover if you
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
somehow someway
 
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
do not provide whatever it is you need
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
to do so you got to leave that in there
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
but guess what you also have to have the
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
30 or 40 000
 
01:25:22.629 --> 01:25:22.639 align:start position:0%
for the next 30 years to cover the
 
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
expenses of that landfill
 
01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.350 align:start position:0%
expenses of that landfill
so

01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:26.390 align:start position:0%
so
i

01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
we were on track without question we
 
01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:29.910 align:start position:0%
we were on track without question we
have

01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
more than enough money to cover the
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
remaining 15 years but because of that
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
change in the regulation in 2014 that
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
put us in a position that this is
 
01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:39.669 align:start position:0%
put us in a position that this is
untenable

01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
untenable
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
for us to do the right thing
 
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm open for any questions you may
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead please
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
red button
 
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
red button sure one
 
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
i'll try the blue button is that working
 
01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
first of all could you give us your name
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
again sure it's mark pitkin p-i-t-k-i-n
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you my question is
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
if you don't
 
01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't you ask for an exemption
 
01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:32.629 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't you ask for an exemption
from

01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:26:32.639 --> 01:26:34.070 align:start position:0%
from
des

01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
des
 
01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
a half million dollars or whatever we're
 
01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
so that that is a great question and i
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
know that we have a representative from
 
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
des that is following me i believe that
 
01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
they submitted testimony that indicated
 
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
the importance of financial assurance
 
01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:52.639 align:start position:0%
and why it was necessary for the
 
01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
health and well-being of those that
 
01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
sort of surround those areas but i am
 
01:26:59.430 --> 01:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
certainly not the best person but if we
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
if we were able to get a waiver of that
 
01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719 align:start position:0%
we would certainly take it but again
 
01:27:06.870 --> 01:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
that's a great question that i'm sure
 
01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
that the representative from des would
 
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
mr pitkin is this uh
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
is this asheville lined
 
01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:23.990 align:start position:0%
is this asheville lined
um

01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
there's only and i'm told there's only
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
two ash landfills in the state and ours
 
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
is probably one of the best maintained
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
and managed in the state since day one
 
01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
and i think that it's also in the
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
written testimony that we have
 
01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
maintained that so the answer is yes
 
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's not only ash but it is lined
 
01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:44.790 align:start position:0%
it's it's not only ash but it is lined
follow-up

01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
is there still some leachate from this
 
01:27:50.310 --> 01:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
that is detected and processed
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
so there's still leachate but over the
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
life of the landfill the amount of
 
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
leachate has dropped precipitously so it
 
01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
used to be
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of gallons and now i
 
01:28:05.669 --> 01:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
believe it's five or six thousand
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
gallons a year
 
01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.229 align:start position:0%
gallons a year
um

01:28:08.229 --> 01:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
and when the process now of working with
 
01:28:11.669 --> 01:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
des to potentially do some testing of
 
01:28:14.310 --> 01:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
the leachate in order to reduce some of
 
01:28:17.669 --> 01:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
the expenses regarding the requirement
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
for testing to help us out
 
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate your
 
01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:29.270 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate your
testimony

01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
i will now call on mike wizzanet
 
01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:36.629 align:start position:0%
i will now call on mike wizzanet
from

01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
oh sorry whimset
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
i i believe we already have
 
01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:54.709 align:start position:0%
i i believe we already have
kevin

01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
i think we all have the written
 
01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:57.830 align:start position:0%
i think we all have the written
testimony

01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:29:03.669 --> 01:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:03.679 --> 01:29:05.350 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair i'm sorry i
 
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
butchered your name that's quite all
 
01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
right i apologize wouldn't be the first
 
01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:12.790 align:start position:0%
right i apologize wouldn't be the first
time

01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair and members of
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
mike wimsat i serve as director of the
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
waste management division for the new
 
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of environmental
 
01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:22.470 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of environmental
services

01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
we certainly appreciate the opportunity
 
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
to be here with you this morning to talk
 
01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
about house bill 1300.
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
um to be clear the department is not
 
01:29:31.110 --> 01:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
taking a position on this bill and
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
that's articulated in the letter that's
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
being distributed and again i understand
 
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
that the letter is also provided
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
electronically in advance so i think
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
everyone should have a copy
 
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
we're not taking a position on the bill
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
but we prepared this written testimony
 
01:29:46.229 --> 01:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
really just to provide some context and
 
01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
also just to give us an opportunity to
 
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
be here to answer any questions that you
 
01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
might have
 
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
um and i think the sponsor and mr pitkin
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
has described what the what the bill is
 
01:29:58.870 --> 01:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
seeking here so i won't review that um
 
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
but i would like to take a moment just
 
01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
to explain the importance of landfills
 
01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
providing financial assurance
 
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
for post-closure care
 
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
right now in new hampshire there are
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
approximately 400 closed
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
uh unlined landfills in the state um and
 
01:30:16.229 --> 01:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
some closed line landfills has been
 
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
discussed here
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
and they all uh have uh
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
long-term care requirements associated
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
with them even after you close the
 
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
landfill and what you do to close the
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
landfills is essentially put a cap over
 
01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
it make sure that cap is maintained that
 
01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
the grass cover is mowed that any if
 
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
there's leachate collection that you're
 
01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
collecting and treating the leachate
 
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
properly you're managing the gas that
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
might be generated from the landfill and
 
01:30:41.189 --> 01:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
then ground and
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
most importantly in with almost every
 
01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:43.830 align:start position:0%
most importantly in with almost every
facility

01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
monitoring the groundwater around that
 
01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it's not
 
01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
creating a situation where it imperils
 
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
the quality of nearby drinking water
 
01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:52.070 align:start position:0%
the quality of nearby drinking water
wells

01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
wells
 
01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:53.750 align:start position:0%
wells
and

01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
so some of those hazards include the
 
01:30:58.709 --> 01:30:58.719 align:start position:0%
possibility of impacting groundwater
 
01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
also landfills can create explosive
 
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
gases which can migrate through the soil
 
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
and create explosive gas conditions in
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
nearby buildings so there's a lot of
 
01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
important work that goes on for
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
monitoring these landfills in most cases
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
these landfills are owned by
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
municipality excuse me municipalities
 
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
that uh that pay for the ongoing care of
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
the of the of the landfills
 
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
in the case of a municipality they are
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
in a position to provide financial
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
assurance through a mechanism known as a
 
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
financial uh local government test so
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
basically if you municip
 
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
there is a requirement that any landfill
 
01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
operator no matter who they are provide
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
financial assurance to show
 
01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
that they have adequate resources to do
 
01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
the long-term care of the facility and
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand that that
 
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
financial assurance is not necessarily a
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
fund to be accessed it's to show that in
 
01:31:53.669 --> 01:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
the case that the the owner of the
 
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
landfill becomes insolvent
 
01:31:58.229 --> 01:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
des would likely be asked to take over
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
the care of that landfill there's
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
adequate funds there to make sure that
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
that's cared for for at least
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
a 30-year period
 
01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
that's what the law requires that's what
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
a operator of landfill is required to do
 
01:32:11.590 --> 01:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
to be in compliance with the financial
 
01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
assurance requirements
 
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
in the case of most municipalities who
 
01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
own these facilities they're able to
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that financial assurance
 
01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
through what's called the local
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
government test because in essence
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
they're they're a taxing authority if
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
they need you know if they they don't
 
01:32:27.669 --> 01:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
essentially become insolvent they can
 
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
always raise funds if they need to to to
 
01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:31.430 align:start position:0%
always raise funds if they need to to to
to

01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
meet their meet their responsibilities
 
01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
but in the case of a private owner of a
 
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
landfill or in this case a non-profit
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
that local government test isn't
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
available to them because they're not in
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
the they're not the same thing as a
 
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
municipality they're not a taxing
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
authority so there are a variety of
 
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
other mechanisms that they can use
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
those include surety bonds or in this
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
case a trust fund which was established
 
01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
for the to provide the financial
 
01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
assurance for this facility and mr
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
picken has described that the history on
 
01:33:01.110 --> 01:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
this is is a little muddled there have
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
been some misunderstandings over time
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
about just what the responsibilities of
 
01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
econ would be with respect to providing
 
01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
for financial assurance for this
 
01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:10.310 align:start position:0%
for financial assurance for this
facility

01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
but i think it needs to be understood
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
that in essence financial assurance is
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
is required on a rolling basis the law
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
change that we made in 2014 was really
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
intended to clarify um that that that is
 
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
a rolling basis there were a number of
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
people econ is not the only person or
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
the only operator
 
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
that that had the understanding that
 
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
they only needed to require provide
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
financial assurance for 30 years and
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
then when 30 years was up they didn't
 
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
need to have financial assurance anymore
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
the unfortunate fact associated with
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
these landfills is that
 
01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
while their costs to maintain them and
 
01:33:47.110 --> 01:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
op and in in their post-closure care
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
period do generally go down over the
 
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
years they never necessarily go away
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
entirely because the landfill is still
 
01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
if you think about what a landfill is it
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
encapsulates the waste and it can
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
continue to pose a risk to groundwater
 
01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
or gas management or any you know pick
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
your particular hazard those hazards can
 
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
be continue to be posed long beyond the
 
01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:11.590 align:start position:0%
be continue to be posed long beyond the
30-year

01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
30-year
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
that initial 30 years
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
following closure of the landfill
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
so that i just want to sort of set the
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
stage for you there in terms of
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
what we do so we manage a financial
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
assurance compliance program where we
 
01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
require these facilities all operators
 
01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
to provide every three years an updated
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
closure cost estimate of what our post
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
closer care cost estimate of what
 
01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
they think they're third for a 30 year
 
01:34:38.709 --> 01:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
period moving out from that date what do
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
they estimate are their costs for
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the facility and then
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
they're required to put to provide some
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
kind of financial assurance for that
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
amount of money
 
01:34:49.109 --> 01:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
in the case of econ unfortunately we
 
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
don't have a current 30-year
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
post-closure care estimate we have about
 
01:34:55.109 --> 01:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
a 15 years so that's one of the first
 
01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
thing that needs to happen is they need
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
to do and we've asked them to do this
 
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
and i know they're working diligently to
 
01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
do it they want to develop that post
 
01:35:05.109 --> 01:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
that 30-year post-closure care cost
 
01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
estimate so they know how much financial
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
insurance they need to provide
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
what we're pretty confident of is that
 
01:35:12.870 --> 01:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
the current amount in their trust fund
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
would not cover the post-closure care
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
costs for a 30-year period so we're
 
01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0%
waiting to to see what that uh
 
01:35:21.270 --> 01:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
estimate will be and then we're working
 
01:35:22.390 --> 01:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
with them we
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
chris aslan from the ag's office and i
 
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
went and met uh several weeks back a
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
couple months now back with uh with econ
 
01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
and their board and we're trying to work
 
01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
out some kind of a solution so that they
 
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
can get the amount of money that they
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
need to have in their financial
 
01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
assurance package
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
and then also
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
maybe the more challenging thing or at
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
least as challenging
 
01:35:44.070 --> 01:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
is ensuring that they have adequate
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
funding each year to provide for the
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
very the actual costs of post-closure
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
care which for them really include the
 
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
cost of you know maintenance and mowing
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
of the cap
 
01:35:57.510 --> 01:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
monitoring of the groundwater monitoring
 
01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:58.470 align:start position:0%
monitoring of the groundwater monitoring
wells

01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
wells
 
01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
periodically and also as mr picken
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
indicated uh collection and proper
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
disposal of the um five or six thousand
 
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
gallons of leachate that the that is
 
01:36:10.629 --> 01:36:10.639 align:start position:0%
collected from the facility each year
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll i'll leave it at that
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
and if there are any questions i'm happy
 
01:36:18.310 --> 01:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
yeah mike um thank you for thank you for
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
for agreeing to the question the
 
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
question i have is is what's not clear
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
to me who missed what when where that
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
allowed this circumstance to be
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
presented it seems
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
concerning and just if you can
 
01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:46.229 align:start position:0%
concerning and just if you can
articulate

01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
articulate
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
clarity for me if you would please sure
 
01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative that's a fair
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
question and i think you know the the
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
story here is not is not entirely clear
 
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
we um are certainly aware that uh you
 
01:36:58.950 --> 01:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
know back when the facility was closed
 
01:37:01.510 --> 01:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
the econ was identified as a it was an
 
01:37:03.109 --> 01:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
unusual situation
 
01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
the claremont ash landfill was a
 
01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:06.470 align:start position:0%
the claremont ash landfill was a
consortium

01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
consortium
 
01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
was used by a consortium of 27 different
 
01:37:08.719 --> 01:37:09.669 align:start position:0%
was used by a consortium of 27 different
towns

01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
most of new hampshire some in vermont as
 
01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:12.790 align:start position:0%
most of new hampshire some in vermont as
well

01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
and there really wasn't a clear
 
01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
pathway for for who you know and the
 
01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
project sort of owned and operated the
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
landfill but then it dissolved when when
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
when when they closed the landfill and
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
so it really wasn't clear what entity
 
01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
would would take that and i think mr
 
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
pitkin has done a better job than i can
 
01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
in describing how
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
econ was identified to to take that on i
 
01:37:36.149 --> 01:37:36.159 align:start position:0%
i take
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
we take them at their word we we believe
 
01:37:39.669 --> 01:37:39.679 align:start position:0%
they did not fully understand what their
 
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and requirements were
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
at the time that they did that i think
 
01:37:44.790 --> 01:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
that in the communications that have
 
01:37:46.229 --> 01:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
occurred since then
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
there have been some miscommunications
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
from the department i think that we need
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge in terms that may have
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
led them to continue to believe that
 
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
they only needed to provide
 
01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
that this this
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
25 or 30 year period that was then
 
01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
converging um
 
01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:03.679 align:start position:0%
but in more recent years we've had very
 
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
clear communications to them to indicate
 
01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
that they do need to have a rolling
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
30-year period of post-closure care an
 
01:38:11.590 --> 01:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
estimate of the cost for that and
 
01:38:13.109 --> 01:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
maintain the
 
01:38:13.119 --> 01:38:13.990 align:start position:0%
maintain the
the

01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.350 align:start position:0%
the
the

01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
financial assurance for that i think um
 
01:38:20.229 --> 01:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
previously when they were allowed to
 
01:38:21.910 --> 01:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
access that fund
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
there was a concern on the i think
 
01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
because we really wanted to see the care
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
of the facility continue when they were
 
01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
saying we need cash to do that annual
 
01:38:29.679 --> 01:38:30.470 align:start position:0%
saying we need cash to do that annual
care

01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
so we did provide them and i believe in
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
a couple of instances permission to
 
01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
access the fund
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
but then it was really
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
very clear that the fund did not have
 
01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:41.430 align:start position:0%
very clear that the fund did not have
adequate

01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
01:38:43.030 --> 01:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
financial assurance for the 30-year
 
01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
period and so those subsequent requests
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
were denied and they've been denied for
 
01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
about the last five or six years and
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
that's of course been a source of
 
01:38:52.390 --> 01:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
frustration for econ because as mr
 
01:38:54.310 --> 01:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
picken indicated they don't ever they
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
don't have a revenue source to to
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
conduct this this work and so
 
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
it's really created a bit of a crisis
 
01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
for them which we're sympathetic to
 
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
um the concern for the department is
 
01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:06.149 align:start position:0%
um the concern for the department is
that

01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:06.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:06.159 --> 01:39:07.030 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:39:09.669 --> 01:39:09.679 align:start position:0%
all facilities including this one will
 
01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
continue to have post-closure care costs
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
associated with them and they need to be
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
provided for not only in the financial
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
assurance mechanism but on an ongoing
 
01:39:20.709 --> 01:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
basis each year those costs need to be
 
01:39:20.719 --> 01:39:24.470 align:start position:0%
basis each year those costs need to be
provided

01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
yes you may thank you madam chairman
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
just for my own notification it seems to
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
me that there was a well 27 communities
 
01:39:34.229 --> 01:39:34.239 align:start position:0%
that were in a cooperative so to speak
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
for this landfill
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
similar to what we have up north i think
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
in some cases and and all the
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
communities chip in together and pay for
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
and subsidize the cost of that uh
 
01:39:47.350 --> 01:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
recycling in landfill
 
01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:49.350 align:start position:0%
recycling in landfill
so

01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
why was the
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
i just don't it's not clear to me why
 
01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:53.750 align:start position:0%
i just don't it's not clear to me why
that

01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
wasn't done enough it wasn't done why it
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
can't happen now because there is there
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
is um
 
01:40:03.669 --> 01:40:03.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility by the users of it to
 
01:40:06.070 --> 01:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
maintain it and that's clear
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
to me anyways and so why are we here
 
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
asking for a half a million dollars for
 
01:40:12.629 --> 01:40:12.639 align:start position:0%
something that should have happened by
 
01:40:12.639 --> 01:40:13.910 align:start position:0%
something that should have happened by
communities

01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
some time ago is by
 
01:40:17.109 --> 01:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
where i don't know if that's a fair
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
question or not i think it's a fair
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
question i'll be honest i i don't know
 
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
the answer to in the early going i i
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
really don't know the history in terms
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
of what what the discussions were that
 
01:40:28.229 --> 01:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
led them to say you know as opposed
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
instead of identifying econ as the owner
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
of the facility you know having those 27
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
communities continue to participate as
 
01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
as sort of co-owners um i think mr
 
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
picken indicated that newport had some
 
01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
concerns about you know the regardless
 
01:40:43.590 --> 01:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
of what those 27 communities would or
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do yes landfills located in
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
newport so they had obviously a very
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
specific interest in controlling what
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
happened and that may have led to the to
 
01:40:52.629 --> 01:40:52.639 align:start position:0%
the agreement and the arrangement that
 
01:40:55.350 --> 01:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
they entered into as far as
 
01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
whether it could happen now
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's a legal question i probably would
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
try not to to go too far down the pike
 
01:41:04.629 --> 01:41:04.639 align:start position:0%
on because i'm not qualified for that
 
01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
but i think that you know the
 
01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
there's been some discussion i think in
 
01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
the last board meeting that that he kind
 
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
of had about that and i'm not sure they
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
have an appetite for that right now or
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
and i think they're probably trying to
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
assess how how successful they'd be in
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
trying to go down that road
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh mr pinken i understand you had an
 
01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:24.550 align:start position:0%
uh mr pinken i understand you had an
answer

01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
on that if you would uh come up and use
 
01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:30.470 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:34.629 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
so i have the distinct pleasure or maybe
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
not but i was actually on the
 
01:41:40.950 --> 01:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
committee at that point in time
 
01:41:43.590 --> 01:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
so with regards to the purchase of the
 
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
landfill there were a couple
 
01:41:47.590 --> 01:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
indemnifications that were approved as
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
part of that process so the first
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
indemnification was of the 27
 
01:41:53.910 --> 01:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
communities that said if you have a
 
01:41:56.709 --> 01:41:56.719 align:start position:0%
major spill if you have a circular event
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
we know we are responsible
 
01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
but also as part of that deal they said
 
01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
we are putting in at that point in time
 
01:42:05.910 --> 01:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
1.1 million we have put in the monies
 
01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
that you have estimated and your experts
 
01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
have estimated and the des has looked at
 
01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
and blessed for financial assurance 1.1
 
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
million and we are also giving you 200
 
01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:16.790 align:start position:0%
million and we are also giving you 200
000

01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
000
 
01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
for you to use should you have any type
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
of spill
 
01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
to use
 
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
in order to figure out what is the spill
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
what needs to be done what is the cost
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
and then if it is a circular event you
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
come to us
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
but as part of that
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
at least the 27 town said but we need an
 
01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
indemnity agreement that you're not
 
01:42:38.790 --> 01:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
going to come to us every single year
 
01:42:41.590 --> 01:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
when your costs change so there is a
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
legal indemnity agreement that basically
 
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
says econ cannot go back to them
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
unless it is based on the indemnity of
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
the major spill because they put in 1.1
 
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
million plus 200 000. so again if it was
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
only 30 years that would have covered
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
everything because we have 15 years left
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
so the issue is now is
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
the reason that we don't have enough
 
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
money to cover it is not because the
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
original amount was not put in it's no
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
longer 30 years now it's 30 years every
 
01:43:14.550 --> 01:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
year so to go back to them they're going
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
to say well same reason we're here
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's not what we thought and we've got
 
01:43:20.229 --> 01:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
an indemnification agreement that you
 
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
can't come back to us if there is a
 
01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:22.790 align:start position:0%
can't come back to us if there is a
change

01:43:22.790 --> 01:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:43:26.070 --> 01:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
so that is basically why it is difficult
 
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
and we are working with an environmental
 
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
attorney attorney cheney um who's very
 
01:43:32.709 --> 01:43:32.719 align:start position:0%
familiar with these and again based upon
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
that subordinate or um indemnification
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
agreement unless it's a major spill you
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
know that was the agreement
 
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
further questions yes uh
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative lynn i wonder if i could
 
01:43:48.629 --> 01:43:48.639 align:start position:0%
ask you has can you tell us
 
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
from your knowledge as this
 
01:43:54.390 --> 01:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
has something like this happened before
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
in other words where the state has been
 
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
asked to
 
01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719 align:start position:0%
to kind of come in and provide funding
 
01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh for this kind of thing i i guess what
 
01:44:05.189 --> 01:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
i'm really what i'm really concerned
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
about is what kind of a precedent this
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
would set and you know maybe maybe it's
 
01:44:10.709 --> 01:44:10.719 align:start position:0%
not setting a president because it's
 
01:44:12.149 --> 01:44:12.159 align:start position:0%
been done before
 
01:44:14.229 --> 01:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
i am not aware of any other landfill
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
operator that has come in and asked
 
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
asked a legislator to sponsor a bill to
 
01:44:20.709 --> 01:44:20.719 align:start position:0%
provide funding for their financial
 
01:44:20.719 --> 01:44:27.109 align:start position:0%
provide funding for their financial
assurance

01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:27.119 --> 01:44:29.109 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:44:29.109 --> 01:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:44:30.629 --> 01:44:30.639 align:start position:0%
you were too close
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
is what happens if they say enough
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
we're done
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
i don't want to do this anymore
 
01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to try to raise funds i've
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
i've had it
 
01:44:43.590 --> 01:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
what happens i mean what what what
 
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
recourse does does the state have
 
01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's closed
 
01:44:51.990 --> 01:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
right well i certainly want to speculate
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
on enforcement i learned a long time ago
 
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
not to do that i mean the state has
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
authority to and the department is
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
granted with authority by the
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
legislature to enforce rsa 149 m which
 
01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
is a solid waste statute so we would
 
01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
have whatever enforcement authorities
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
are available to us under that statute
 
01:45:11.109 --> 01:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
for in the abstract for any party who
 
01:45:12.550 --> 01:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet its financial assurance
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
requirements um and that's you know
 
01:45:16.229 --> 01:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
starts out administratively with you
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
know obviously sending letters and
 
01:45:18.709 --> 01:45:18.719 align:start position:0%
saying you need to you're not in
 
01:45:20.070 --> 01:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
compliance with your requirements you
 
01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
need to meet them and then of course
 
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
whatever other civil or you know um
 
01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
authorities that it has under the
 
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
statute and
 
01:45:30.149 --> 01:45:30.159 align:start position:0%
in this particular case if the facility
 
01:45:32.229 --> 01:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
um you know if econ said we're just
 
01:45:33.510 --> 01:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
checking out we're not going to do this
 
01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
anymore then
 
01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
under the current circumstances um i
 
01:45:39.830 --> 01:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
believe the the balance that is in the
 
01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:42.159 align:start position:0%
trust fund right now would would come to
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
to use for
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
the post-closure care of the facility
 
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
eventually that would be exhausted
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
presumably there would still be
 
01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
post-closure care to be to be
 
01:45:57.590 --> 01:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
conducted each year and the cost of that
 
01:45:59.350 --> 01:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
barring anyone else being able to do it
 
01:46:01.030 --> 01:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
would would potentially come to the
 
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
state to oversee to hire contractors to
 
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
perform that post-closure care and the
 
01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
taxpayers would have to pay for that
 
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
through you know the budget process
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up yeah
 
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
because what what what i'm hearing is we
 
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
have an insolvent business
 
01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:19.030 align:start position:0%
have an insolvent business
and

01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
the state's being asked to make it quote
 
01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:22.470 align:start position:0%
the state's being asked to make it quote
solvent

01:46:22.470 --> 01:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
solvent
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh in order to have this fund
 
01:46:24.239 --> 01:46:28.629 align:start position:0%
uh in order to have this fund
requirement

01:46:28.629 --> 01:46:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
it confuses me
 
01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
and i guess that
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative flynn has the same
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
question it confuses me why is the state
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
involved in this
 
01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
i know why you're involved in it but why
 
01:46:41.590 --> 01:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
is the state a funding agent
 
01:46:43.350 --> 01:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
for an entity
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
and the the agency is not taking a
 
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
position on this bill and i don't have
 
01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
an answer for that
 
01:46:55.750 --> 01:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
i guess i i'm confused about why they
 
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
have to keep operating
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
if once they're insolvent and they hold
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
they have that option i would assume
 
01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:08.790 align:start position:0%
they have that option i would assume
um

01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
i guess any operator or landfill has the
 
01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
potentially abdicating its
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um
 
01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:18.870 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um
however

01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:19.830 align:start position:0%
however
um

01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
again i i don't want to speculate on
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
what you know how the agency would
 
01:47:24.790 --> 01:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
respond to that or its enforcement
 
01:47:25.750 --> 01:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
authorities i don't think that's
 
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate for me to do that
 
01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
our job in administering the statute is
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
to ensure that all landfill operators
 
01:47:34.149 --> 01:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
have adequate financial assurance and
 
01:47:35.669 --> 01:47:35.679 align:start position:0%
that they conduct their post-closure
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
care on an annual basis
 
01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:40.639 align:start position:0%
um and in all cases they're they're
 
01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
generally doing that um
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
and in fact it has to be said the econ
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
um in
 
01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:48.159 align:start position:0%
partnership with the town of newport has
 
01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
been doing that they've been performing
 
01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
their post-closure care this this is not
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
a facility that is not being cared for
 
01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to report that
 
01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
um and there is some money although
 
01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:58.390 align:start position:0%
um and there is some money although
probably

01:47:58.390 --> 01:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:47:59.669 --> 01:47:59.679 align:start position:0%
certainly not an adequate amount of
 
01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
money in the trust fund to provide the
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
financial assurance it just needs to be
 
01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
increased but even if you if you could
 
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
magically make that financial assurance
 
01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:08.470 align:start position:0%
magically make that financial assurance
adequate

01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
um in in in that trust fund
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
there's still the issue of which we're
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
very sympathetic to of having that
 
01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
adequate funding each year to perform
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
the post-closure care
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions uh yes
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
01:48:27.270 --> 01:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank thank you madam chair i
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
i think i have four but the the key one
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
to me is
 
01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:33.030 align:start position:0%
to me is
um

01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
given that we're talking about a 30-year
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
period and making sure we can reach the
 
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
end of a rolling 30-year period i'm just
 
01:48:42.149 --> 01:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
curious what the emergency is i mean
 
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
we're bringing this item in in
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
mid-budget cycle and if there's not a
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
funding emergency because there's enough
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
money for five or ten years
 
01:48:54.390 --> 01:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh why why are we not dealing with this
 
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
in a regular budget cycle
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
well to that part of your question i
 
01:49:00.790 --> 01:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
would just say i i don't have an answer
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
for that this is not a bill that edes
 
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
has sponsored or you know has asked to
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
ask to come forward um i would note
 
01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
however that
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
and that's part of the importance of the
 
01:49:12.550 --> 01:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
conversation the financial assurance is
 
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
not intended to be used each year to
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
perform the annual care it's intended to
 
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
be there as
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
a trust fund in the event that the
 
01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:22.550 align:start position:0%
a trust fund in the event that the
operator

01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
operator
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't continue meeting their
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for post-closure care
 
01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:27.669 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for post-closure care
so

01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:27.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
what should happen here is that
 
01:49:30.870 --> 01:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
financial assurance needs to be brought
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
up to the amount required and then
 
01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
the operator in this case econ needs to
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
have adequate funding each year which is
 
01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
not a lot of money but it's it's you
 
01:49:41.589 --> 01:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
know it's meaningful um to do that
 
01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
post-closure care outside without
 
01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
accessing the funds in the trust fund
 
01:49:47.669 --> 01:49:47.679 align:start position:0%
they should not be looking to access the
 
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
trust fund funds
 
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.030 align:start position:0%
trust fund funds
follow-up

01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for that that that's more
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
clear to me it sounds like we're setting
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
up more of a bond than an operating fund
 
01:50:01.270 --> 01:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
is that a yes or an uh
 
01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:02.070 align:start position:0%
is that a yes or an uh
yeah

01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
i think that's a reasonable analogy
 
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
okay and then on page two of uh the
 
01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
department's testimony it refers to
 
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
like all other active and closed
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
landfills in the state this sort of gets
 
01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
to representative lin and emmerich's uh
 
01:50:17.199 --> 01:50:18.709 align:start position:0%
to representative lin and emmerich's uh
question

01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:50:19.990 --> 01:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
do we
 
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
are there any other landfills or any
 
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
other projects similar to this that we
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
need to be worried about
 
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
off the top my head i'm not aware
 
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
specifically of any facilities that
 
01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
don't have adequate financial assurance
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
right now they're well i
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
i don't want to talk we don't know all
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
the facts but there may be one in
 
01:50:41.589 --> 01:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
central new hampshire that
 
01:50:44.229 --> 01:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
the ownership scenario is is muddled and
 
01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
there there may be one more that where
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
we've got some concerns about financial
 
01:50:51.430 --> 01:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
assurance okay uh you have a follow-up
 
01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:52.470 align:start position:0%
assurance okay uh you have a follow-up
uh

01:50:52.470 --> 01:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
last one thank you for your patience
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
madam chair um
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
okay so i listened to the president last
 
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
night talk about uh federal funding for
 
01:51:04.229 --> 01:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
uh replacing lead pipes so that we have
 
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
safe drinking water and since we're
 
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
talking about leaching of
 
01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:10.070 align:start position:0%
talking about leaching of
landfills

01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
are you aware of whether or not there's
 
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
any federal funds
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
that would be accessible for
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
this sort of endeavor
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
i'm not currently aware of any funds in
 
01:51:22.870 --> 01:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
that category but i have to say the the
 
01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:23.669 align:start position:0%
that category but i have to say the the
the

01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:25.270 --> 01:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
guidance provided by the federal
 
01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
government for
 
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
use of the funds from the american
 
01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
rescue plan act and the bipartisan
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure law is still evolving and
 
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
we we're certainly keeping a close eye
 
01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
on that to understand what the range of
 
01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
options might be for use of those funds
 
01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
and we'd certainly look you know
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
anything look like it could be access
 
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
for something like this we would
 
01:51:48.149 --> 01:51:48.159 align:start position:0%
certainly bring it to econ's attention
 
01:51:50.229 --> 01:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
i i just have one question that is
 
01:51:52.629 --> 01:51:52.639 align:start position:0%
confusing me a little bit
 
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
and that is you say
 
01:51:59.430 --> 01:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
that you have to keep a 30-year
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
fund there just in case so if i'm
 
01:52:06.229 --> 01:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
closing a landfill i have to provide
 
01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
assurances that i have 60 years worth of
 
01:52:09.199 --> 01:52:10.629 align:start position:0%
assurances that i have 60 years worth of
money

01:52:10.629 --> 01:52:10.639 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:52:14.070 --> 01:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
to take at least 60 years or is it 90 or
 
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
120 no it it's it's it's a rolling 30 so
 
01:52:20.070 --> 01:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
i mean so let's say on in year one you
 
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
close the landfill right you need to
 
01:52:24.310 --> 01:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
show that you have adequate funding
 
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
let's say in the example if you're using
 
01:52:27.910 --> 01:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
a for trust fund that you have a trust
 
01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
fund has enough money that if you walked
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
away today the state could take over the
 
01:52:34.229 --> 01:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
management of the facility and have
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
enough money in that trust fund to to
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
provide post-closure care for 30 years
 
01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
assuming you don't walk away though the
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
expectation is you maintain that
 
01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
financial assurance
 
01:52:46.629 --> 01:52:46.639 align:start position:0%
and you also do spend whatever
 
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
incremental amounts of money from other
 
01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
funds that are needed to do that
 
01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
post-closure care each year so what
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying excuse me what you're
 
01:52:57.189 --> 01:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
saying is that it's for a 30-year period
 
01:52:57.199 --> 01:52:59.750 align:start position:0%
saying is that it's for a 30-year period
period

01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
it's for right and what we call it a
 
01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
rolling third because what it means is
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
under the law you have to reassess your
 
01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:06.950 align:start position:0%
under the law you have to reassess your
um

01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
your you estimate your closure costs
 
01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
every three years so let's say year one
 
01:53:13.109 --> 01:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
you you do what i just described year
 
01:53:15.669 --> 01:53:15.679 align:start position:0%
four you come in and you say okay here's
 
01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
our here's what we think our costs are
 
01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%
and you look at the amount in the trust
 
01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
fund and if the costs have gone down
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
you're fine because the trust fund will
 
01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
have enough money to cover that if
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
they've gone up you might have to add
 
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
more money to the trust fund to to uh to
 
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh cover that that difference but the
 
01:53:33.589 --> 01:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
idea is that at all times during your
 
01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
ownership of the facility
 
01:53:38.149 --> 01:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
you maintain 30 years financially enough
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
money to cut in the trust fund to cover
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
the next 30 years of care
 
01:53:45.510 --> 01:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
and i guess that gets to my question
 
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
when does the next 30 years expire
 
01:53:53.189 --> 01:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
sure so it never expires basically but
 
01:53:55.109 --> 01:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
what i would say though is that in
 
01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
practice what we see is that the cl the
 
01:54:00.229 --> 01:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
care costs in the early years are higher
 
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
and they go down over time because as
 
01:54:04.149 --> 01:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
the landfill matures
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
um maybe the monitoring gets so stable
 
01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
you don't need to monitor as often you
 
01:54:09.589 --> 01:54:09.599 align:start position:0%

there are a couple things the state does
 
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
and the state has done in new hampshire
 
02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
since about 1931
 
02:04:13.750 --> 02:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
when the office of the comptroller was
 
02:04:16.149 --> 02:04:16.159 align:start position:0%
established as a means of fiscal control
 
02:04:17.669 --> 02:04:17.679 align:start position:0%
the state does an annual financial
 
02:04:20.069 --> 02:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
report sometime in the 80s we switched
 
02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
to doing it by
 
02:04:23.669 --> 02:04:23.679 align:start position:0%
you know the real way government
 
02:04:25.830 --> 02:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
generally accepted accounting principles
 
02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:26.629 align:start position:0%
generally accepted accounting principles
um

02:04:26.629 --> 02:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:28.550 --> 02:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
which i think was a bit of a task at the
 
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
time um i like to say to people that if
 
02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
we don't do this you can't exist as a
 
02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
state we would have to shut down our
 
02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:36.470 align:start position:0%
state we would have to shut down our
business

02:04:36.470 --> 02:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:04:37.910 --> 02:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
and the business being state government
 
02:04:39.589 --> 02:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
that would be problematic in a couple of
 
02:04:40.870 --> 02:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
ways right
 
02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:41.750 align:start position:0%
ways right
um

02:04:41.750 --> 02:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
although taxpayers might be happy
 
02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
because i think we would also have to
 
02:04:46.550 --> 02:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
stop collecting taxes
 
02:04:48.069 --> 02:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
but if unless you're an anarchist it
 
02:04:50.470 --> 02:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:04:53.350 --> 02:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
it would be problematic um
 
02:04:55.510 --> 02:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
basically i i think that the caver
 
02:04:57.030 --> 02:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
serves um
 
02:04:59.270 --> 02:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
a few different roles and i i came upon
 
02:05:01.830 --> 02:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
this in a answer to a question at fiscal
 
02:05:03.189 --> 02:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
um the other day and i thought about it
 
02:05:04.390 --> 02:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
this way
 
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
there's a way in which um this document
 
02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
is so it's fundamentally it's an
 
02:05:09.990 --> 02:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
accounting document right it's a whole
 
02:05:12.790 --> 02:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
bunch of people with green eye shade um
 
02:05:14.470 --> 02:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
going over stuff and reading through
 
02:05:16.709 --> 02:05:16.719 align:start position:0%
them and and figuring out if we recorded
 
02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
everything the right way and are we
 
02:05:20.069 --> 02:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
tracking everything
 
02:05:23.109 --> 02:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
but at its most basic level for for the
 
02:05:24.870 --> 02:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
people of the state and for the
 
02:05:27.030 --> 02:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
management of the state the the policy
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
management of the state which is which
 
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
is you all um it's a transparency
 
02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
document this is this is somebody has
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
looked at the way state government works
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
somebody has examined what we're doing
 
02:05:39.189 --> 02:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
someone has examined the money coming in
 
02:05:41.830 --> 02:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
and going out and you don't have to take
 
02:05:43.750 --> 02:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
anybody's word for it that money is
 
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
coming in and going out you have a whole
 
02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
bunch of different eyeballs looking at
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
it and then that document is posted
 
02:05:52.629 --> 02:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
far and wide for everyone to see people
 
02:05:54.390 --> 02:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
who buy bonds for the state can look at
 
02:05:56.310 --> 02:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
it expect to look at it or they won't
 
02:05:59.109 --> 02:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
loan us money people who for some reason
 
02:06:00.149 --> 02:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
want to see if we're trying to pull
 
02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
anything sneaky um can look at it people
 
02:06:04.149 --> 02:06:04.159 align:start position:0%
who want to see what our long-term
 
02:06:06.149 --> 02:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
obligations are can look at it and say
 
02:06:07.669 --> 02:06:07.679 align:start position:0%
is there anything going on that no one's
 
02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
talking about in the future and from a
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
financial standpoint the entirety of
 
02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
state government and the the health of
 
02:06:17.350 --> 02:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
state government is basically in the
 
02:06:19.109 --> 02:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
picture you don't you don't look at what
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
we spent last week on groceries you look
 
02:06:24.229 --> 02:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
at all the obligations going up and
 
02:06:25.510 --> 02:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
yeah we have money in the bank account
 
02:06:26.709 --> 02:06:26.719 align:start position:0%
right now but the mortgage payment
 
02:06:29.030 --> 02:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
hasn't been paid yet oh geez that's out
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
there and there's sections in it that
 
02:06:32.709 --> 02:06:32.719 align:start position:0%
have that talk about lawsuits that might
 
02:06:35.589 --> 02:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
be coming up so from a transparency and
 
02:06:37.350 --> 02:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
accountability standpoint it's a very
 
02:06:39.430 --> 02:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
fundamentally important document
 
02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
um i i mean i do say that we would have
 
02:06:43.750 --> 02:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
to shut down as a state without doing it
 
02:06:45.669 --> 02:06:45.679 align:start position:0%
frankly people would look at us weird
 
02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
we'd be you know
 
02:06:49.350 --> 02:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
the best modern example is we'd be
 
02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:50.629 align:start position:0%
the best modern example is we'd be
illinois

02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
illinois
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
02:06:55.510 --> 02:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
sorry to anybody who grew up in chicago
 
02:06:57.669 --> 02:06:57.679 align:start position:0%
but it would you know i mean we i use
 
02:06:59.189 --> 02:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
illinois because everybody's sort of
 
02:07:01.589 --> 02:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan everyone knows it's a basket
 
02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
case and their governors usually go to
 
02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
jail and stuff like that um and it's and
 
02:07:08.470 --> 02:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
everything's a mess there and we're not
 
02:07:10.310 --> 02:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
a mess and we produce a document every
 
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
year that show it's not a mess early in
 
02:07:13.830 --> 02:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
the history when they established a
 
02:07:16.069 --> 02:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
comptroller right departments used to
 
02:07:17.669 --> 02:07:17.679 align:start position:0%
spend what they spent and then three
 
02:07:18.629 --> 02:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
quarters of the way through the year
 
02:07:20.229 --> 02:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
they'd come to the legislature and go
 
02:07:23.189 --> 02:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
hey um we ran out
 
02:07:24.790 --> 02:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
can we get some more
 
02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
and the people got sick of that and they
 
02:07:28.790 --> 02:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
wanted you know budgets and control and
 
02:07:32.229 --> 02:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
all that so early on the executive
 
02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
branch did its own audit
 
02:07:36.069 --> 02:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
fairly early they separated that it's
 
02:07:38.069 --> 02:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
part of the creation of uh
 
02:07:40.629 --> 02:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
an office that became the legislative
 
02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
budget assistant was that a dif one
 
02:07:43.599 --> 02:07:44.709 align:start position:0%
budget assistant was that a dif one
branch

02:07:44.709 --> 02:07:44.719 align:start position:0%
branch
 
02:07:46.470 --> 02:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
audits the other branch
 
02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:47.430 align:start position:0%
audits the other branch
um

02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:49.510 --> 02:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh big picture we have all the numbers
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
in there the numbers are for the
 
02:07:52.390 --> 02:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
entirety state government but the
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
legislative branch audits the um
 
02:07:58.149 --> 02:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
executive branch and they do so
 
02:08:00.550 --> 02:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
not by
 
02:08:02.069 --> 02:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
you know these two people
 
02:08:04.470 --> 02:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
um running around to every department of
 
02:08:06.550 --> 02:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
state government but they do it by
 
02:08:08.470 --> 02:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
hiring an auditing firm lately that
 
02:08:10.550 --> 02:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
auditing firm is very nationally
 
02:08:13.270 --> 02:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
recognized kpmg
 
02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
um i don't know what kpmg stands for
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
anymore i think one of them is pete
 
02:08:19.510 --> 02:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
marwick but i don't even know
 
02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:20.790 align:start position:0%
marwick but i don't even know
but

02:08:20.790 --> 02:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:08:23.030 --> 02:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
there you go and um so that's the
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
fundamental what it is and you know um
 
02:08:28.709 --> 02:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
basically if you've got a question about
 
02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
whether the numbers are right
 
02:08:31.669 --> 02:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
about anything going on in state
 
02:08:33.189 --> 02:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
government you can turn to this and look
 
02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
at it and the truth is that 99 of us
 
02:08:40.390 --> 02:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
um will have trouble without a guide
 
02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
right because it's a complicated
 
02:08:43.910 --> 02:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
accounting document but one of the
 
02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
things like everything that's related to
 
02:08:48.149 --> 02:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability
 
02:08:51.270 --> 02:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's there and somebody
 
02:08:53.030 --> 02:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
somebody with a little more experience
 
02:08:55.830 --> 02:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
can look at it and raise questions is is
 
02:08:57.350 --> 02:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
the thing that
 
02:08:59.669 --> 02:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
keeps us all honest so to speak that's
 
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
that's a way too high profile an
 
02:09:03.109 --> 02:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
overview and dana will talk about things
 
02:09:04.290 --> 02:09:04.300 align:start position:0%
you should care about
 
02:09:04.300 --> 02:09:06.870 align:start position:0%
you should care about
[Music]

02:09:06.870 --> 02:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you charlie good
 
02:09:09.119 --> 02:09:10.310 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you charlie good
afternoon

02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
um i'm gonna remove this so i just don't
 
02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
sound muffled
 
02:09:14.790 --> 02:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
the effort is
 
02:09:19.430 --> 02:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
compiled in the office of the
 
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
comptroller but it takes
 
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
obviously a whole slew of folks around
 
02:09:27.109 --> 02:09:27.119 align:start position:0%
agencies to compile this document we
 
02:09:29.830 --> 02:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
have six months to issue it so the state
 
02:09:32.709 --> 02:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
fiscal year is june 30 and statutorily
 
02:09:36.229 --> 02:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
by 12 31 we need to issue the document
 
02:09:39.350 --> 02:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
what it does is it combines all of all
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
of our entities into one place so you'll
 
02:09:43.589 --> 02:09:43.599 align:start position:0%
notice if you flip through it
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to see other entities such
 
02:09:47.350 --> 02:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
as the new hampshire retirement system
 
02:09:49.189 --> 02:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
the university system
 
02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
there's a community college system
 
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
there's a variety of other entities plus
 
02:09:54.390 --> 02:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
our own the liquor commission the
 
02:09:56.470 --> 02:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
lottery commission and turnpike
 
02:09:58.870 --> 02:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
turnpike they all have their own
 
02:10:02.229 --> 02:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
separate audits so they all either have
 
02:10:05.109 --> 02:10:05.119 align:start position:0%
an outside firm or lba
 
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
and they hire someone to do their own
 
02:10:08.709 --> 02:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
separate audits and they actually many
 
02:10:10.470 --> 02:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
of them have their own separate document
 
02:10:12.069 --> 02:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
similar to this
 
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
so what we do is while that's going on
 
02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
and they're getting audited uh kpmg is
 
02:10:20.629 --> 02:10:20.639 align:start position:0%
auditing the entirety and we put it all
 
02:10:23.109 --> 02:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
together in one document so you get a
 
02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
bigger picture of everything combined in
 
02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:26.950 align:start position:0%
bigger picture of everything combined in
one

02:10:26.950 --> 02:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:10:29.430 --> 02:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
but you can also go to those other
 
02:10:31.669 --> 02:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
audits if you needed more information on
 
02:10:34.069 --> 02:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
those separate entities so it's helpful
 
02:10:37.510 --> 02:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
from that sense but every entity
 
02:10:39.830 --> 02:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
again who needs one mainly for bonding
 
02:10:41.589 --> 02:10:41.599 align:start position:0%
or anything else is going to have a
 
02:10:43.750 --> 02:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
similar document and they're put
 
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
together under similar accounting
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
standards and they're the layout is very
 
02:10:50.310 --> 02:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
similar so even you know even private
 
02:10:51.669 --> 02:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
companies would have an annual report
 
02:10:53.910 --> 02:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
and it would look somewhat similar
 
02:10:55.270 --> 02:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
we work under government accounting
 
02:10:56.550 --> 02:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
standards so we have some different
 
02:10:59.750 --> 02:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
things but um essentially it starts with
 
02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
the um there's a transmittal letter
 
02:11:04.550 --> 02:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
which is written by us and
 
02:11:06.550 --> 02:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
opens up the document and talks about a
 
02:11:08.629 --> 02:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
lot of the things that you would all be
 
02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
interested in i think when i was here
 
02:11:12.629 --> 02:11:12.639 align:start position:0%
previously i pointed you to page eight
 
02:11:14.390 --> 02:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
which is where the surplus statement is
 
02:11:16.709 --> 02:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
for the general education trust fund uh
 
02:11:18.950 --> 02:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
because that is generally what
 
02:11:20.229 --> 02:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at budgets that's
 
02:11:22.790 --> 02:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
what you're most interested in
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
so i can just give you a quick walk
 
02:11:27.669 --> 02:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
through if you like um
 
02:11:29.910 --> 02:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
after the transmittal we have the audit
 
02:11:31.669 --> 02:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
opinion which is important obviously and
 
02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
that's what kpmg presented to fiscal
 
02:11:37.030 --> 02:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
there is some analysis as well but if
 
02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
you turn to page
 
02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:40.149 align:start position:0%
you turn to page
30

02:11:40.149 --> 02:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
30
 
02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry 28 and 29
 
02:11:45.510 --> 02:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
that's essentially our balance sheet for
 
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:11:47.910 --> 02:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
so that is
 
02:11:50.069 --> 02:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
with everything combined all the
 
02:11:51.669 --> 02:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
entities i mentioned
 
02:11:53.990 --> 02:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
that is where we stand from a balance
 
02:11:55.510 --> 02:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
sheet perspective
 
02:11:58.069 --> 02:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
it includes all of our capital assets as
 
02:12:00.069 --> 02:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
well as our long-term liabilities such
 
02:12:03.030 --> 02:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
as pension obligations and
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
the like outstanding debt
 
02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
and so that's a that's a big picture and
 
02:12:10.550 --> 02:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
then if you turn to
 
02:12:13.589 --> 02:12:13.599 align:start position:0%
page 33 is the balance sheet of the
 
02:12:16.229 --> 02:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
funds you're probably most familiar with
 
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
which is general fund highway fund
 
02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
education fund and you can take a look
 
02:12:23.189 --> 02:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
at what those balances look like and
 
02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
their fund balances
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
and i would mention the
 
02:12:29.589 --> 02:12:29.599 align:start position:0%
statements are obviously on a
 
02:12:32.229 --> 02:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
gaap basis we refer to which is accrual
 
02:12:32.239 --> 02:12:33.350 align:start position:0%
gaap basis we refer to which is accrual
accounting

02:12:33.350 --> 02:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
accounting
 
02:12:35.270 --> 02:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
generally accepted accounting principles
 
02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
so it's not necessarily on a budgetary
 
02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
basis but if you look through the
 
02:12:41.589 --> 02:12:41.599 align:start position:0%
document elsewhere in the document we do
 
02:12:43.669 --> 02:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
provide some budgetary information to
 
02:12:45.270 --> 02:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
kind of give you a sense
 
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
of budget to actuals
 
02:12:49.350 --> 02:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
so be beyond the statement there's a
 
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
there's multiple pages of footnotes and
 
02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
what we do there is we take a particular
 
02:12:55.990 --> 02:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
line item that might be of interest and
 
02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:57.109 align:start position:0%
line item that might be of interest and
provide

02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:13:00.470 --> 02:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
extra pages of charts and information to
 
02:13:02.470 --> 02:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
break down the details so if for
 
02:13:04.390 --> 02:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
instance you were interested in capital
 
02:13:06.390 --> 02:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
assets you would go to that page and
 
02:13:07.910 --> 02:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
look at the details if you're interested
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
in debt or how long our debt excuse me
 
02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
how long are debt payments go out you
 
02:13:14.069 --> 02:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
would look at that page
 
02:13:16.069 --> 02:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
so that's that's basically the financial
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
statements and the footnotes portion um
 
02:13:20.629 --> 02:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
and again there's a lot of schedules in
 
02:13:22.149 --> 02:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
the back that break down the other
 
02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
entities that we talked about
 
02:13:27.589 --> 02:13:27.599 align:start position:0%
as well like this state revolving fund
 
02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
is one of those and there's a breakdown
 
02:13:31.910 --> 02:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
of that and more towards the middle
 
02:13:34.149 --> 02:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
and then the back section is a lot of um
 
02:13:36.550 --> 02:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
informational um so there's there's a
 
02:13:39.109 --> 02:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
lot of we call the statistical section
 
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
where you might find information on
 
02:13:44.069 --> 02:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
number of employees on a variety of
 
02:13:47.189 --> 02:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
information statewide that we compile
 
02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
and that information is not necessarily
 
02:13:52.069 --> 02:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
audited but most of it aligns with the
 
02:13:54.069 --> 02:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
financial information so if you wanted
 
02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
02:13:57.750 --> 02:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
more details on the
 
02:14:00.629 --> 02:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
general fund surplus you'd find a page
 
02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
there that would align with how we
 
02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
presented in the front
 
02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:10.629 --> 02:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
we obviously this is a lengthy effort
 
02:14:13.589 --> 02:14:13.599 align:start position:0%
for us and and it takes um it takes the
 
02:14:15.990 --> 02:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
variety of agencies that provide us
 
02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
information that goes into this document
 
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
so it really is a statewide effort
 
02:14:22.709 --> 02:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
to to complete this and obviously our
 
02:14:25.270 --> 02:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
goal is to complete it on time and
 
02:14:27.109 --> 02:14:27.119 align:start position:0%
have a clean audit opinion as a result
 
02:14:29.350 --> 02:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
which we did again this year so
 
02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:30.550 align:start position:0%
which we did again this year so
um

02:14:30.550 --> 02:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
i think that's the that's the highlights
 
02:14:35.589 --> 02:14:35.599 align:start position:0%
but i'll be happy to take questions
 
02:14:41.030 --> 02:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:42.550 --> 02:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you madam
 
02:14:45.030 --> 02:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
controller i've had a constituent that's
 
02:14:46.709 --> 02:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
had a lot of questions lately about the
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
02:14:50.950 --> 02:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
and i found the section in here very
 
02:14:54.550 --> 02:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
incomplete i did notice that gasby
 
02:14:54.560 --> 02:14:55.830 align:start position:0%
incomplete i did notice that gasby
85

02:14:55.830 --> 02:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
85
 
02:14:59.270 --> 02:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
or 75 said we had to start listing opeb
 
02:15:00.790 --> 02:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
liabilities which
 
02:15:01.990 --> 02:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
put us
 
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
a couple of billion dollars in the hole
 
02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
as our financial position but what i do
 
02:15:06.719 --> 02:15:07.830 align:start position:0%
as our financial position but what i do
recall

02:15:07.830 --> 02:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
recall
 
02:15:10.149 --> 02:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
is back in 2011 when we decided that we
 
02:15:12.550 --> 02:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
were in the hole on the overall
 
02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
actuarial retirement system that we
 
02:15:16.550 --> 02:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
needed to change it
 
02:15:18.709 --> 02:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
so changes were made
 
02:15:18.719 --> 02:15:19.669 align:start position:0%
so changes were made
and

02:15:19.669 --> 02:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:15:21.589 --> 02:15:21.599 align:start position:0%
at the time i think we were two billion
 
02:15:24.149 --> 02:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
short in that retirement system and we
 
02:15:26.069 --> 02:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
were hoping that we would make gains on
 
02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
that in a 30-year projection
 
02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:30.550 align:start position:0%
that in a 30-year projection
however

02:15:30.550 --> 02:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:15:33.189 --> 02:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
nothing is showing in here to show
 
02:15:35.350 --> 02:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
whether we've made progress on that gap
 
02:15:37.669 --> 02:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
which i believe is now twice what it was
 
02:15:40.870 --> 02:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
in 2011 but there's nothing in here that
 
02:15:42.790 --> 02:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
gives you any information and when i
 
02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:44.149 align:start position:0%
gives you any information and when i
recently

02:15:44.149 --> 02:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
recently
 
02:15:46.629 --> 02:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
a year ago said we needed to
 
02:15:46.639 --> 02:15:47.510 align:start position:0%
a year ago said we needed to
audit

02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
audit
 
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
the retirement system because you're
 
02:15:51.669 --> 02:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
only making one percent return
 
02:15:53.189 --> 02:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
they suddenly this year say they're
 
02:15:56.390 --> 02:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
making a 26 return but that isn't in
 
02:15:58.470 --> 02:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
here either so
 
02:16:00.310 --> 02:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
i think we ought to go and kick them in
 
02:16:02.550 --> 02:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
the butt over retirement system and say
 
02:16:04.629 --> 02:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
you're giving us just
 
02:16:04.639 --> 02:16:05.750 align:start position:0%
you're giving us just
nothing

02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
02:16:09.270 --> 02:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
right you put in a 6.75
 
02:16:11.430 --> 02:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
assumed return and you never give the
 
02:16:14.149 --> 02:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
real return ever in these things
 
02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
and it and it wouldn't be in this
 
02:16:17.350 --> 02:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
document so i don't have a great answer
 
02:16:19.030 --> 02:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
for that because the retirement system
 
02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
does have their own separate audit and
 
02:16:23.430 --> 02:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
they have separate actuarial reports so
 
02:16:25.669 --> 02:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
but we can look into providing more in
 
02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:16:30.069 --> 02:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
the financial obligation section is just
 
02:16:33.270 --> 02:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
the state employee portion of the nhrs
 
02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:34.469 align:start position:0%
the state employee portion of the nhrs
obligation

02:16:34.469 --> 02:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
so they have an entire system that they
 
02:16:38.709 --> 02:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
provide financial statements for but we
 
02:16:41.349 --> 02:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
do have ability in our narrative at the
 
02:16:43.669 --> 02:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
front where we could talk more about the
 
02:16:45.990 --> 02:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
impact of the retirement system to our
 
02:16:48.150 --> 02:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
employees so that is an area we can look
 
02:16:49.750 --> 02:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
to add language
 
02:16:51.669 --> 02:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
well it's also a big effect on our
 
02:16:54.150 --> 02:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
overall standing which isn't reflected
 
02:16:56.150 --> 02:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
in here it talks about the opeb
 
02:16:58.150 --> 02:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
liability putting us
 
02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
our standard position two billion
 
02:17:02.389 --> 02:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
dollars in the hole from where we were
 
02:17:04.389 --> 02:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
kind of neutral but i think we're
 
02:17:05.990 --> 02:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
actually six billion dollars in the
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
whole if all things should be reported
 
02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:09.990 align:start position:0%
whole if all things should be reported
the

02:17:09.990 --> 02:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:17:11.509 --> 02:17:11.519 align:start position:0%
something one important thing to think
 
02:17:11.519 --> 02:17:12.950 align:start position:0%
something one important thing to think
about

02:17:12.950 --> 02:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
excuse me um
 
02:17:16.709 --> 02:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a picture of state
 
02:17:19.429 --> 02:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
government and it's the state
 
02:17:22.230 --> 02:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
government's financial position etc um
 
02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:23.030 align:start position:0%
government's financial position etc um
the

02:17:23.030 --> 02:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:17:24.389 --> 02:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
the you know in some states where the
 
02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
retirement system is part of state
 
02:17:27.509 --> 02:17:27.519 align:start position:0%
government in some place states where
 
02:17:28.389 --> 02:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
ours has not since a court case from
 
02:17:33.509 --> 02:17:33.519 align:start position:0%
20 or 30 years ago at this point um and
 
02:17:36.070 --> 02:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
so they do have they do have their own
 
02:17:38.070 --> 02:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
financials a lot of the things you're
 
02:17:40.230 --> 02:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
asking about the the
 
02:17:42.549 --> 02:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
uh the annualized rate of return etc are
 
02:17:43.990 --> 02:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
in their financial documents and they
 
02:17:45.190 --> 02:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
put them out
 
02:17:47.509 --> 02:17:47.519 align:start position:0%
the only thing i would add is is
 
02:17:47.519 --> 02:17:48.950 align:start position:0%
the only thing i would add is is
we

02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:17:50.870 --> 02:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
we're in a situation with them where you
 
02:17:52.389 --> 02:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
know we can call them up and ask them
 
02:17:54.870 --> 02:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
questions and the typical response is
 
02:17:56.709 --> 02:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
you're not the boss of us
 
02:17:58.629 --> 02:17:58.639 align:start position:0%
and um and we're not we're not the boss
 
02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
of them and so our relationship with
 
02:18:03.349 --> 02:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
them is is often very good
 
02:18:05.270 --> 02:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
and often
 
02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
you're not the boss of us and so so a
 
02:18:09.990 --> 02:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
lot of the information you want you're
 
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
going to you really are going to have to
 
02:18:13.589 --> 02:18:13.599 align:start position:0%
get from them our goal is to is to make
 
02:18:16.389 --> 02:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
sure that we we quantify on an annual
 
02:18:19.990 --> 02:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
basis the state's liability as and
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
as to the rate of return
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:28.790 --> 02:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
my my predecessor
 
02:18:30.950 --> 02:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
gerard hired me so you you know you got
 
02:18:33.110 --> 02:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
to be thankful
 
02:18:34.469 --> 02:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
um i
 
02:18:37.110 --> 02:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
i will i will mention though uh on one
 
02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
of the pages i pointed out to you on our
 
02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
balance sheet we do distinguish between
 
02:18:42.309 --> 02:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
our opeb liability which is our other
 
02:18:44.070 --> 02:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
post-employment benefits
 
02:18:46.469 --> 02:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
and the pension liability so we have two
 
02:18:48.870 --> 02:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
liabilities on the books um one is about
 
02:18:50.150 --> 02:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
a billion dollars one is about two
 
02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
billion dollars so it's it's there but
 
02:18:56.549 --> 02:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:59.910 --> 02:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative emrick
 
02:19:01.429 --> 02:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
02:19:03.750 --> 02:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
is there a section in here that it
 
02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:04.629 align:start position:0%
is there a section in here that it
says

02:19:04.629 --> 02:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
says
 
02:19:07.669 --> 02:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
at the end at the as of june 30th before
 
02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
the accrual setups and everything
 
02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
many millions of dollars
 
02:19:18.389 --> 02:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
is there a section here that says what
 
02:19:21.030 --> 02:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
happened to that or does he just kind of
 
02:19:22.230 --> 02:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
do this
 
02:19:25.110 --> 02:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
if you look at page eight
 
02:19:28.389 --> 02:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
so historically it's it's sort of an uh
 
02:19:30.389 --> 02:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
inside joke that um
 
02:19:31.750 --> 02:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
occasionally people will call up and say
 
02:19:33.669 --> 02:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
how's the kaffir look and they don't
 
02:19:34.950 --> 02:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
actually care
 
02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
and they want to look at page eight
 
02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
and it's what they want to see is the
 
02:19:39.750 --> 02:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
surplus statement and surplus statement
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
is a is a thing as you i'm sure a lot of
 
02:19:44.709 --> 02:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
you know lba does a surplus statement
 
02:19:46.230 --> 02:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
02:19:47.910 --> 02:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
and i think during your budget process
 
02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
we'll typically do
 
02:19:52.309 --> 02:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
you know updates four five six times um
 
02:19:54.630 --> 02:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
and probably at some point um around
 
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
this time of the year this is the actual
 
02:20:00.230 --> 02:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
audited version so so it resembles very
 
02:20:02.710 --> 02:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
closely that statement but it will show
 
02:20:05.429 --> 02:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
you for example how much there was um
 
02:20:06.550 --> 02:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
how much there was at the end of the
 
02:20:08.230 --> 02:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
year what expenditures actually turned
 
02:20:10.630 --> 02:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
out to be how much lapses actually were
 
02:20:13.590 --> 02:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 20 21 et cetera
 
02:20:15.349 --> 02:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
what happened to the surplus was any of
 
02:20:18.389 --> 02:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
it transferred here there or elsewhere
 
02:20:20.469 --> 02:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
many years not this past year their
 
02:20:22.230 --> 02:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
transfers made to the education trust
 
02:20:25.030 --> 02:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
fund to shore up the the
 
02:20:28.070 --> 02:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
nominal deficit in that which i which is
 
02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
its own sort of fiction
 
02:20:32.630 --> 02:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
and where it happens and here it'll show
 
02:20:34.630 --> 02:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
a very large balance
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
because what's supposed to happen at the
 
02:20:38.309 --> 02:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
end of the second year of a biennium is
 
02:20:40.950 --> 02:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
that everything in savings goes to the
 
02:20:42.870 --> 02:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund and you will notice the
 
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund account
 
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh is 257.8 million which i'm pretty
 
02:20:49.429 --> 02:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
sure is
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
pretty close to double as high as it's
 
02:20:52.389 --> 02:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
ever been
 
02:20:54.550 --> 02:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
i mean it's a remarkable number
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
so it's all right there so that's it's
 
02:20:57.590 --> 02:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
all there
 
02:20:59.270 --> 02:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's how you that's how you can check
 
02:21:03.910 --> 02:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:05.190 --> 02:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:21:06.550 --> 02:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
i would also
 
02:21:10.309 --> 02:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:15.590 --> 02:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
das and in particular comptroller for
 
02:21:18.870 --> 02:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
the information that is included in here
 
02:21:18.880 --> 02:21:19.750 align:start position:0%
the information that is included in here
if

02:21:19.750 --> 02:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:21:22.790 --> 02:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
if you don't know an answer to something
 
02:21:25.590 --> 02:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
about finances
 
02:21:28.389 --> 02:21:28.399 align:start position:0%
if you go to the section in here that
 
02:21:30.790 --> 02:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
talks about it
 
02:21:32.790 --> 02:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
the answer is here
 
02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:33.750 align:start position:0%
the answer is here
and

02:21:33.750 --> 02:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:34.870 align:start position:0%
and
