00:23:42.169 --> 00:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
issue my question would be what's so
 

00:23:42.179 --> 00:23:43.730 align:start position:0%
issue my question would be what's so
different<00:23:42.360><c> about</c><00:23:42.600><c> that</c><00:23:42.900><c> school</c><00:23:43.140><c> then</c><00:23:43.320><c> what's</c>

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:43.740 align:start position:0%
different about that school then what's
 

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:45.830 align:start position:0%
different about that school then what's
the<00:23:44.039><c> best</c><00:23:44.280><c> practice</c><00:23:44.580><c> that</c><00:23:45.120><c> they're</c><00:23:45.480><c> doing</c>

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
the best practice that they're doing
 

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.049 align:start position:0%
the best practice that they're doing
there

00:23:47.049 --> 00:23:47.059 align:start position:0%
there
 

00:23:47.059 --> 00:23:50.090 align:start position:0%
there
and<00:23:48.059><c> so</c><00:23:48.299><c> we</c><00:23:48.659><c> oftentimes</c><00:23:49.140><c> look</c><00:23:49.440><c> at</c><00:23:49.559><c> figures</c><00:23:49.919><c> and</c>

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
and so we oftentimes look at figures and
 

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.830 align:start position:0%
and so we oftentimes look at figures and
we<00:23:50.280><c> say</c><00:23:50.460><c> well</c><00:23:50.640><c> this</c><00:23:50.820><c> percentage</c><00:23:51.240><c> is</c><00:23:51.360><c> apropos</c>

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
we say well this percentage is apropos
 

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.110 align:start position:0%
we say well this percentage is apropos
