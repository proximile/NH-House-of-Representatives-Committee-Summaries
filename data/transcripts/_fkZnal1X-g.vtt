00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.350 align:start position:0%
okay community member can come back and
uh

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 align:start position:0%
not hope not
 
00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.810 align:start position:0%
not hope not
right

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 align:start position:0%
all right so let's uh let's let's just
 
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
have a general uh conversation here
 
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.710 align:start position:0%
have a general uh conversation here
about

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 align:start position:0%
what were some of the Impressions that
 
00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
you heard this morning and then it's my
 
00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.410 align:start position:0%
you heard this morning and then it's my
intent

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
intent
 
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
to be out of here by 12 30 all right
 
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
but anyway
 
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh any any general comments uh
 
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
any Impressions that you had this
 
00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
morning that uh
 
00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 align:start position:0%
yeah okay yes
 
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
yeah I would say we don't have enough
 
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
Staffing for anything
 
00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 align:start position:0%
so how do you how do you fix that
 
00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 align:start position:0%
problem other than you know student loan
 
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
forgiveness or whatever for these jobs
 
00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
and I don't even know if that would help
 
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
any but you know the
 
00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 align:start position:0%
they're going out of state
 
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
so how do you
 
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
yeah as I find it interesting Kareem
 
00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 align:start position:0%
when you mentioned the um you know the
 
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
one-on-one eighth we keep getting more
 
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
one-on-one A's but these kids some of
 
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
these kids it's it's you're just trying
 
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
to put a stopper on what they're doing
 
00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 align:start position:0%
and are you really educating them so
 
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
that's just myself what do you do about
 
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
it it's in dry
 
00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
thanks um working on that we when we
 
00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 align:start position:0%
were talking about the nursing school
 
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
nurses and being able to do it before
 
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 align:start position:0%
you finish with your degree for example
 
00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 align:start position:0%
so I would be interested in looking at
 
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
those rules of who does who which came
 
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 align:start position:0%
you know where that has a basis in law
 
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
what of who does tests for what and see
 
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
if we can do some a similar situation
 
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.670 align:start position:0%
if we can do some a similar situation
okay

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.009 align:start position:0%
okay
representative

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
well I kind of go back to um the
 
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
training as as well that you know unless
 
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
you have trained people that are
 
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
specifically trained and and as she said
 
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 align:start position:0%
professional Educators dealing with
 
00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 align:start position:0%
these problems
 
00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
you know I I would hate because we have
 
00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
a staffing issue to to water it down you
 
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
know as far as that's concerned and I
 
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
think we also need to look at What
 
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
legislation we're passing that that
 
00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
makes things easier and better for
 
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 align:start position:0%
people and What legislation have we
 
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 align:start position:0%
passed or that we have been talking
 
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
about that actually
 
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
diminishes the the ability of the
 
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
schools to do to to reach kids that are
 
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
having mental health problems or to deal
 
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
with kids that just have social
 
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
emotional problems on a daily level
 
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.310 align:start position:0%
emotional problems on a daily level
um

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
at one point somewhere in school psych
 
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
or whatever they often talked about how
 
00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 align:start position:0%
teenage years are a mental condition in
 
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
itself you know so uh you know it's
 
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
every day uh when you're teaching you
 
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
have these little things bubbling up in
 
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 align:start position:0%
your classroom or kids coming in or if
 
00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 align:start position:0%
you're coaching you know oftentimes you
 
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
get kids coming and talking to you and
 
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
considering that the climate right now
 
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 align:start position:0%
and some of the legislation we've passed
 
00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
I feel as a classroom teacher I would be
 
00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
very hesitant to to do or to talk about
 
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
certain things and and it would it
 
00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
restricts your ability to interact with
 
00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.030 align:start position:0%
restricts your ability to interact with
kids

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
Echo everything that's been said but
 
00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's between mental health education
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 align:start position:0%
I believe is a very very different
 
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.550 align:start position:0%
I believe is a very very different
opportunity

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 align:start position:0%
than much of our discussion today about
 
00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
how are we addressing the needs of
 
00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 align:start position:0%
students who have a mental health
 
00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:39.650 align:start position:0%
students who have a mental health
condition

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
condition
 
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think it's important when we
 
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
talk about 505
 
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
and the whole bundle
 
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 align:start position:0%
that we are careful to separate
 
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
so that people have a better
 
00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 align:start position:0%
understanding of Mental Health
 
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
which isn't treatment
 
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
it's not therapy
 
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
the Educators do need appropriate
 
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
knowledge and training for sure
 
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
but it's not anywhere near the level of
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
training of a professional who would
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
treat a mental health condition
 
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 align:start position:0%
not all mental health conditions can be
 
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.230 align:start position:0%
not all mental health conditions can be
prevented

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
prevented
 
00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
but many are less likely to occur if
 
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
people know the risk factors and know
 
00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:32.699 align:start position:0%
the lifestyles and behaviors that reduce
 
00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:34.070 align:start position:0%
the lifestyles and behaviors that reduce
risk

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
risk
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
yeah that that that was a con that was
 
00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 align:start position:0%
an aha moment for me too I mean the
 
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
whole issue of the curriculum of
 
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
Education vis-a-vis what's the
 
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
intervention service
 
00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 align:start position:0%
right and that's and that's one of the
 
00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.419 align:start position:0%
places where you get into the whole
 
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
Staffing issue of what's available I
 
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 align:start position:0%
mean I mean when you hear somebody it's
 
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
got to wait two years to get a damn
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
referral to Services I mean that's I
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
don't know I'm sorry sorry I spoke a
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
little bit but I I got I got wood
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
all right and I'm sorry no no just jump
 
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
jumping on to Pope and Mel's comment
 
00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:14.759 align:start position:0%
right there you know I'm sort of seeing
 
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
it as as really three things though
 
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
there's the um there's the water factors
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
that contribute to it
 
00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:24.539 align:start position:0%
how do you go about treating it and how
 
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
you go about identifying
 
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
um it so so so you know I think the
 
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
point Linda made was really getting at
 
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
the what are the factors that contribute
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
um to this epidemic and is this
 
00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:40.979 align:start position:0%
partially an epidemic of our making
 
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
you know can I answer that you cut in
 
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
for just a second on that I was reading
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
a report that came out in 2003 regarding
 
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:55.580 align:start position:0%
Civics education in our schools
 
00:07:58.189 --> 00:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
here's here's the statement many
 
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
teachers fear criticism or even
 
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
litigation if they address topics that
 
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
may be considered controversial or
 
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
political in nature
 
00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:10.979 align:start position:0%
so what we're experiencing today is not
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
uncommon from what was experienced 20
 
00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:14.759 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
and and so I I think that we we have to
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
get away from that a little bit and be
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
able to get into the ability that we're
 
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
going to be discussing and talking about
 
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
these topics and mental health is one of
 
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
them and we've got to resolve it and we
 
00:08:32.089 --> 00:08:32.099 align:start position:0%
have to have those intervention
 
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:35.700 align:start position:0%
resources available and it's it's
 
00:08:38.209 --> 00:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
handled differently and I honestly
 
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
believe a lot of it is based on
 
00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:41.339 align:start position:0%
resources in the community but also
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
leadership in the buildings
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
if you don't have proper leadership in a
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
building with all the money in the world
 
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get things fixed
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
and and I can recall as a principal I
 
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
invited Community Mental Health to come
 
00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
in and be in my building I've provided
 
00:08:59.630 --> 00:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
them a room two or three days a week
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
depending upon where we got with that
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
need we were a school of about 500 kids
 
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
and I had all the resources there but I
 
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:08.700 align:start position:0%
was lacking the resource of community
 
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
involvement and and you know it's acting
 
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
like that Silo I sometimes talk about
 
00:09:16.009 --> 00:09:16.019 align:start position:0%
and with that within three or four years
 
00:09:17.449 --> 00:09:17.459 align:start position:0%
of bringing Community Mental Health into
 
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
the building
 
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:21.260 align:start position:0%
our issues in the building just just
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
lessened it was just a wonderful
 
00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:26.519 align:start position:0%
environment and it wasn't coming from a
 
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
prejudiced principle here it was just
 
00:09:30.889 --> 00:09:30.899 align:start position:0%
very observable by community and parents
 
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
all together but that resource has to be
 
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:33.949 align:start position:0%
all together but that resource has to be
available

00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:33.959 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
that's what we were talking about today
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
when you were a tier chair lab that even
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
if schools want to bring in the mental
 
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
health professionals there's such a
 
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
shortage right now in in every area that
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
that you know there can't be wrapper on
 
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
Services because there just isn't
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
anything available and that money dries
 
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
up and the state doesn't assume that
 
00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
burden and that's what's happened here
 
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
and it's happening right now when we're
 
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
losing the Gopher money and everything
 
00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:03.959 align:start position:0%
else yeah and do you remember when they
 
00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:06.899 align:start position:0%
closed the state hospital 30 years ago
 
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
and they funded the Community Mental
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
Health Centers how well they were funded
 
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
and all the services they could provide
 
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
and they aren't funded at all now it's
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
really cut down and one of the things we
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
talked about too is whether Jane can
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
find out some State models that we might
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
want to look at
 
00:10:28.009 --> 00:10:28.019 align:start position:0%
uh vis-a-vis what we currently have here
 
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
that might be a at least a platform for
 
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
us to begin to look at what some of the
 
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
components might be easiest yeah that's
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
true ECS might be able to have the same
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative education
 
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
Commission in the states and Jennifer
 
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
for is listening this it's being
 
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:46.140 align:start position:0%
streamed and she's going to review this
 
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
whole thing and she is a researcher
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's available to us good
 
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
schools still have to be schools and
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
they still have to teach and teachers
 
00:11:03.769 --> 00:11:03.779 align:start position:0%
are trained to teach but they're not
 
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
trained to be psychologists
 
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.550 align:start position:0%
trained to be psychologists
and

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
what we know from social emotional
 
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
learning is if it's going to be
 
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
effective it needs to be in the school
 
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
at the home
 
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
and in the community and they all have
 
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
to work together and it seems like part
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
of our we have a couple of breakdowns
 
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
one is in the community what do we do
 
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
about that I mean here we are we're
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
education right and it seems like we're
 
00:11:35.449 --> 00:11:35.459 align:start position:0%
trying to solve an education
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
a fundamental underlying issue with
 
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.410 align:start position:0%
a fundamental underlying issue with
community

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
and even when you get as they were
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
saying even when you get referrals
 
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
to outside sources the parents don't get
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
them there and so there's
 
00:11:51.889 --> 00:11:51.899 align:start position:0%
that whole breakdown and how are we as
 
00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:54.290 align:start position:0%
that whole breakdown and how are we as
educators

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
educators
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
dealing with or can we even deal with
 
00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
the overall cultural breakdown
 
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
um there is not just in our state but
 
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
trained people healthcare workers and so
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
even as they were saying how can you get
 
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
somebody like that in the school when
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
you can't even get them out of the
 
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
school and part of that
 
00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
as I'm discovering through my husband
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
who's on Edna is all the requirements on
 
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
licensing and all of that kind of stuff
 
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:35.420 align:start position:0%
with psychologists in this state
 
00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:38.579 align:start position:0%
they're finding that and we've talked to
 
00:12:38.579 --> 00:12:40.310 align:start position:0%
they're finding that and we've talked to
some

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
that it was a totally subjected somebody
 
00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:45.779 align:start position:0%
could have we talked to a man who went
 
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
through all of the school stuff passed
 
00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:50.700 align:start position:0%
all of the things passed all of his
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
exams and everything and then they had a
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
how do you feel about this and they
 
00:12:57.889 --> 00:12:57.899 align:start position:0%
wouldn't give him the license
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
because they had an agenda they had a
 
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:02.700 align:start position:0%
political whatever and he didn't fit
 
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.710 align:start position:0%
political whatever and he didn't fit
that

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
and that's I mean that's not an
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
education thing but it is happening in
 
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:11.220 align:start position:0%
our state and we talked to this guy who
 
00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
now is looking for a completely
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
different type of job
 
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.889 align:start position:0%
different type of job
just

00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:15.899 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
because whatever reason so that's being
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
done in Edna and they're trying to look
 
00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
at licensing and trying to clear that up
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
so that may help with some of our supply
 
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
but um I know it's a crazy thing that
 
00:13:31.449 --> 00:13:31.459 align:start position:0%
that something should be subjective
 
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
instead of objective as to whether or
 
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
not you get a license well one of the
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
things too that Melissa talked about was
 
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
the issue of the agencies working
 
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
together and I I re I can vividly
 
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
remember the conversation we had in this
 
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
group when we were talking about
 
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion
 
00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
and yet he had the the HHS over here in
 
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
the department or the education
 
00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
department over here and said okay well
 
00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
well how are you talking to one another
 
00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:01.740 align:start position:0%
and I would think that that goes back to
 
00:14:03.889 --> 00:14:03.899 align:start position:0%
the whole question of how do you get
 
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
these multiple agencies to provide the
 
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
kinds of foundational support that's
 
00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:11.579 align:start position:0%
there regardless of where you are but at
 
00:14:12.889 --> 00:14:12.899 align:start position:0%
least you need to be talking with one
 
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
another uh represent woodcock
 
00:14:18.889 --> 00:14:18.899 align:start position:0%
thanks chairman I want to go back to a
 
00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:20.579 align:start position:0%
couple of points when you started the
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
discussion what do we think from the
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
from the earlier meeting
 
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
um I think Linda was hitting on uh
 
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:30.060 align:start position:0%
representative Tana not necessarily the
 
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
the CRT
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
propola but rather the the linking of
 
00:14:38.449 --> 00:14:38.459 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and teachers losing
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
time in the classroom especially I teach
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
a losing time in a classroom for the
 
00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
amount of regulatory things we put in
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
across the state or doe puts in that
 
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:47.220 align:start position:0%
takes the time to get away from teaching
 
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
but the bigger piece of this to me is
 
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's clear uh to me anyhow
 
00:14:56.689 --> 00:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
and as is I'm sure on this table that we
 
00:14:59.870 --> 00:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
have a youth Mental Health crisis in New
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we have the United States
 
00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:03.899 align:start position:0%
but right now our focus is on New
 
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:06.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the model that we're using
 
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
the delay referral test waiting list all
 
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
that time those youngsters aren't
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
getting the adequate education they
 
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
should be getting I don't know finding a
 
00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:17.459 align:start position:0%
lot of time in real life with with
 
00:15:20.449 --> 00:15:20.459 align:start position:0%
teachers and staff and I I disagree with
 
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
Alicia and I think that we need the
 
00:15:25.009 --> 00:15:25.019 align:start position:0%
school unfortunately is put in the
 
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
position that they have to take on more
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
of a task as we have kids who need food
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
we have to feed them some of us think we
 
00:15:34.129 --> 00:15:34.139 align:start position:0%
have to feed them as we need if the kids
 
00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
who needs mental health you have to
 
00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
provide that because we take any Pieces
 
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:39.660 align:start position:0%
away the educational success of the
 
00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
youngsters is not going to matriculate
 
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
so I'm thinking that we really need to
 
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
look at you know it's not the name broke
 
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
don't break you know don't fix it I
 
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
think it broke
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
I think the way we look at mental health
 
00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:54.899 align:start position:0%
and education here under our auspices
 
00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
under the legislative hospitals under
 
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
the doe auspice it broke and this is
 
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
just one piece of that and and we can't
 
00:16:05.689 --> 00:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
wait five or six or seven years to say
 
00:16:06.889 --> 00:16:06.899 align:start position:0%
how we're gonna go back and fix this
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
these kids that live now I got five
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
seven years forget the testing results
 
00:16:14.569 --> 00:16:14.579 align:start position:0%
they're going to be folks out of the
 
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
school who don't have skills
 
00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what we can't we
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
can't keep on delaying I think what came
 
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
to me today is listened to all three and
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
we have three different presentations
 
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:27.500 align:start position:0%
here coming from three different
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
perspectives and they all basically said
 
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
the same thing we got prices
 
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
and and the traditional way of fixing
 
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
things just can't be doing that so I
 
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
that's what you asked when you started
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
the dialogue grows in Milo what did you
 
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
get out of the meeting that's what I got
 
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:42.839 align:start position:0%
we we have to step up and do something
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh and not put it in the slow mode until
 
00:16:47.329 --> 00:16:47.339 align:start position:0%
like five years waiting I get thank you
 
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
yeah uh representative McDonald I think
 
00:16:53.569 --> 00:16:53.579 align:start position:0%
you're representative Miler and yes this
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
is important and the first presentation
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
was from UNH extension and on the
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
handout they gave they have survey data
 
00:17:02.329 --> 00:17:02.339 align:start position:0%
from the youth risk behavior survey
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
these data points that say concerning
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
information about students attempting
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
suicide and mental health risks we've
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
had previous discussions about this
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
survey and have determined that at best
 
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
it might be inaccurate and
 
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:18.900 align:start position:0%
the department has testified today that
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
at the very best that's your own
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
segmentation is back dated two years so
 
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
my question is because this is so
 
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
important what can we do to get more
 
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
accurate surveys because since resources
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
are so limited we need to unfortunately
 
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
Target these resources to those who need
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
it most and how can we tell that if the
 
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
survey date is a little bit at least
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
backdated two years so my question is
 
00:17:45.289 --> 00:17:45.299 align:start position:0%
what can we do to improve this survey
 
00:17:45.299 --> 00:17:47.350 align:start position:0%
what can we do to improve this survey
data

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.310 align:start position:0%
data
enough

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair
 
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
um you you had mentioned about the the
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
silos and I'm wondering if we're sort of
 
00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
jumping into one here as well because I
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
think the area that we're talking about
 
00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
certainly extends far beyond the typical
 
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
policy areas of this committee and um
 
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
and when you were talking about it
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
earlier Mel it made me it made me think
 
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.610 align:start position:0%
earlier Mel it made me it made me think
about

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:12.620 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
some of the policy areas that the HHS
 
00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:18.059 align:start position:0%
committee gets involved with and some of
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
the policy areas the Commerce Committee
 
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh gets involved with particularly when
 
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
it comes to mental health parity policy
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
um uh you know with respect to different
 
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
Insurance programs and uh we're
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
certainly I think our our two-hour you
 
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
know two hours worth of of meeting this
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
morning certainly the words funding came
 
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
up a number of times and uh and Paul's
 
00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:48.299 align:start position:0%
possibly uh funding mechanisms for for
 
00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
for this sort of
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
um uh you know for mental health uh
 
00:18:57.529 --> 00:18:57.539 align:start position:0%
could come from outside of the um
 
00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
the the typical adequate education funds
 
00:19:03.169 --> 00:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
and uh when we take a look at the
 
00:19:06.049 --> 00:19:06.059 align:start position:0%
numbers and we can disagree on on
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
the numbers but uh but I think it's
 
00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:12.059 align:start position:0%
certainly affecting a substantial number
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
of students and um and the result of
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
that effect is not inconsequential on
 
00:19:21.169 --> 00:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
those that the students learning and and
 
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
their success in life and and our
 
00:19:27.049 --> 00:19:27.059 align:start position:0%
economy and everything else that um that
 
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
that contributes to that but but
 
00:19:32.409 --> 00:19:32.419 align:start position:0%
possibly Mr chair uh we may want to
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
convene a um uh maybe a a work group
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
that that includes some folks from from
 
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
HHS and folks from Commerce and um and I
 
00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:46.919 align:start position:0%
was particularly looking up um maybe
 
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
maybe you know like John dejoy who would
 
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
spend quite a bit of time in Commerce
 
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
and um and has I think he also
 
00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
represents the um the mental health
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
counseling I think Jane
 
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:01.850 align:start position:0%
counseling I think Jane
um

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:01.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.130 align:start position:0%
um
um

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:03.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:06.049 --> 00:20:06.059 align:start position:0%
and and you know that that certainly
 
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
something that that we're talking about
 
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
is maybe being a resource yeah you're
 
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we have our Silo here
 
00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what I'm suggesting is that
 
00:20:18.169 --> 00:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
is that where siled so here's here's
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
what I here's what I have I just
 
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
this is not a definitive list but
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
I've got what we've talked about in the
 
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
last 20 minutes we've got the issue of
 
00:20:30.169 --> 00:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
staffing issues
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
training of Educators around this issue
 
00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:35.900 align:start position:0%
the impact of legislation both
 
00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:39.260 align:start position:0%
negatively and positively around
 
00:20:42.289 --> 00:20:42.299 align:start position:0%
schools and services Etc
 
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
we talked a little bit about the
 
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:47.660 align:start position:0%
differentiation of health education
 
00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
versus services and intervention issues
 
00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
which are separate
 
00:20:54.529 --> 00:20:54.539 align:start position:0%
and we talked a little bit about State
 
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
models and then the issue we just talked
 
00:20:59.289 --> 00:20:59.299 align:start position:0%
about perhaps the need
 
00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
to have some joint committee work on
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
this and I think also the issue that
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald mentioned too
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
are there other are there other metrics
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
that we can look at too that would go
 
00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
beyond just the the other one survey I
 
00:21:18.169 --> 00:21:18.179 align:start position:0%
mean we need to see what are the issues
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
out there where we've got some metrics
 
00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:22.740 align:start position:0%
around this and not just the one survey
 
00:21:24.289 --> 00:21:24.299 align:start position:0%
that we've talked about here within this
 
00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
committee so those I think Mr chair
 
00:21:28.669 --> 00:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
those are the issues that I think that
 
00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:30.539 align:start position:0%
we've we've been talking about in your
 
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:33.780 align:start position:0%
absence those are good and I I'd like to
 
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
just Echo what I heard yesterday from
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
several teachers which were testifying
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
or was was yesterday or day before
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
teacher is being spit on right now
 
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh things have changed since covid kids
 
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
you know for example even the two high
 
00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
school boys I put on the plane last
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
night to try to get to
 
00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
Myrtle Beach got down to DC and had to
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
do a little bit of time there because
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
the storms and all
 
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
um they one had the experience of being
 
00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
in school during covid
 
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
one day a week
 
00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
the other student because he was in a
 
00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
lower grade
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
and was there for four days a week guess
 
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
who has the good study habits right now
 
00:22:24.169 --> 00:22:24.179 align:start position:0%
guess the one that's on task and the one
 
00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:27.860 align:start position:0%
that is still very compliant and and and
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
knows what rules mean the one that was
 
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
there four days per week it was the one
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
that wasn't was pretty much on his own
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
doing his own thing and now we have kids
 
00:22:41.289 --> 00:22:41.299 align:start position:0%
walking in the door in the schoolhouse
 
00:22:43.789 --> 00:22:43.799 align:start position:0%
with some of them with that type of
 
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
mentality right now and it's been very
 
00:22:48.649 --> 00:22:48.659 align:start position:0%
very difficult in fact I have a daughter
 
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
who is a special ed teacher dealing with
 
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
life skills and she was pushed down the
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
stairwell and had to have her hip
 
00:22:55.679 --> 00:22:56.930 align:start position:0%
stairwell and had to have her hip
replaced

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
replaced
 
00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
by as by a kid that was just emotionally
 
00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.750 align:start position:0%
by as by a kid that was just emotionally
disturbed

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
disturbed
 
00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
and and so this is but that's not
 
00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:07.799 align:start position:0%
necessarily uncommon today we have
 
00:23:09.649 --> 00:23:09.659 align:start position:0%
teachers being hurt and we have other
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
kids being hurt we have deaths being
 
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
thrown around and it's pretty sad when
 
00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
you have to evacuate a classroom saying
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
all the kids are doing a good job get
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
out of here and we'll take care of the
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
one that's not that's kind of you know a
 
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
reverse psychology than what I've been
 
00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
used to as an administrator or a teacher
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot we have to do here but
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
the data we're using I'd like to make
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
sure we're using solid data I'd like to
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
um there there are schools where maybe
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
they're not having the degree of of
 
00:23:42.169 --> 00:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
issue my question would be what's so
 
00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:43.740 align:start position:0%
different about that school then what's
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
the best practice that they're doing
 
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.049 align:start position:0%
the best practice that they're doing
there

00:23:47.049 --> 00:23:47.059 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
and so we oftentimes look at figures and
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
we say well this percentage is apropos
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
for the whole state well maybe maybe not
 
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
I know that when I talk to a senator
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
dalessandro he was saying well we have
 
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
you know uh folks in every one of our
 
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
schools now that is a community resource
 
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
type person because of the Dynamics of
 
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
the the the the student that's coming to
 
00:24:13.549 --> 00:24:13.559 align:start position:0%
them and and so
 
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
what's good happening in Manchester may
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
not be happening in Hopkinton
 
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
maybe I don't know so I'd like to make
 
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
sure the data is accurate and that's the
 
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunate thing I I don't think we've
 
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
ever really gotten good data
 
00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:30.179 align:start position:0%
um I know that you know I've asked for
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
data before from doe you know on on
 
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
costs of things and they've been like
 
00:24:36.289 --> 00:24:36.299 align:start position:0%
three four million dollars off
 
00:24:39.289 --> 00:24:39.299 align:start position:0%
and that was not uncommon six or seven
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
and and and so the it's whether they
 
00:24:45.169 --> 00:24:45.179 align:start position:0%
don't have the Personnel or they they
 
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
don't the accountability is something
 
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
which we're lacking the knowledge of
 
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
what's going on the schools and somehow
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
the survey work we gotta we can't be
 
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
satisfied with a 20 return or a 30
 
00:24:59.810 --> 00:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
return you get those from those that are
 
00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:03.059 align:start position:0%
compliant returning but I'd like to see
 
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
something we talked about the health
 
00:25:08.289 --> 00:25:08.299 align:start position:0%
survey they get back every biennium
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
when you get a hold of that and I'll
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody gets copy you'd be
 
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
very appalled to see what's on it
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
there are some that just say no I'm not
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.289 --> 00:25:26.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if the regional Public
 
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
um be a part of coordination because
 
00:25:36.049 --> 00:25:36.059 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about agencies
 
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
sometimes it can be done in regions so
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
that they're coordinated that's one
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
thought school districts who have
 
00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
healthier financial budget also higher
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
full-time social workers in their
 
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.970 align:start position:0%
full-time social workers in their
districts

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
poor districts can't get that that's
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
that's a key parent School connector the
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
third piece to think about is a lot of
 
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
schools have done the response to
 
00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:06.299 align:start position:0%
intervention model or the multi-tiered
 
00:26:09.529 --> 00:26:09.539 align:start position:0%
systems of behavior the PBIS is also
 
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
another model or responsive classroom at
 
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
the elementary school as a model but
 
00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
data collection is key for all of that
 
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
and if you have a social emotional
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
learning program
 
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
you have to collect social emotional
 
00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.830 align:start position:0%
you have to collect social emotional
data

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:26:27.409 --> 00:26:27.419 align:start position:0%
and so I question I mean we issued a
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
screening to young kids
 
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
to make sure they were okay you know
 
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
it's a check-in type process
 
00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:36.289 align:start position:0%
it's a check-in type process
um

00:26:36.289 --> 00:26:36.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
but the legislation on non-academic
 
00:26:41.409 --> 00:26:41.419 align:start position:0%
surveys now May
 
00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:46.140 align:start position:0%
curtail that I mean is that in conflict
 
00:26:48.169 --> 00:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
I didn't I don't know
 
00:26:48.179 --> 00:26:50.090 align:start position:0%
I didn't I don't know
Maybe

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
Maybe
 
00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
and adding to that do we know what
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
keen's doing what Plymouth State's doing
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
what UNH is doing in terms of preparing
 
00:26:59.330 --> 00:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
these folks they're coming up to the
 
00:27:00.769 --> 00:27:00.779 align:start position:0%
elementary schools coming out of a
 
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
program what type of skills are they
 
00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
being taught
 
00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
do we need that data
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
I would say we do we need to do some
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
I don't know if the middle still running
 
00:27:21.289 --> 00:27:21.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
on that note my question
 
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.130 align:start position:0%
on that note my question
um

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
yes we have rules about student filled
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
out data
 
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
but what there's a lot of data we should
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
be able to have about how many behavior
 
00:27:36.409 --> 00:27:36.419 align:start position:0%
issues a school has what they're seeing
 
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
in particular I mean that's teacher and
 
00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
administrator filled out as opposed to
 
00:27:42.769 --> 00:27:42.779 align:start position:0%
because there are no rules about what
 
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
they can now teachers say I'm supposed
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
to be teaching I've heard this a number
 
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
of times and not
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
filling out surveys
 
00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:54.380 align:start position:0%
and not keeping track of numbers of
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
incidences and stuff like that but it
 
00:27:59.390 --> 00:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:05.649 --> 00:28:05.659 align:start position:0%
can we somehow look at the evidences of
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
disturbance as opposed to trying to just
 
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
the teacher shortage committee has
 
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
requested that we have some principles
 
00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
come in uh it was brought up just the
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
other day when we're talking about this
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
very issue that a teacher would notice
 
00:28:26.269 --> 00:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
that there's a problem in the classroom
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
and it's a disruptive problem so the kid
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
is sent out four minutes later the kid's
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
back in the classroom after being down
 
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
the principal's office and it hasn't
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
been resolved but you have to deal with
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
it so that's that's not uncommon so how
 
00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:43.820 align:start position:0%
do we capture that information
 
00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
and that that's why I said very
 
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
beginning of this thing leadership in
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
the building is imperative and you have
 
00:28:51.649 --> 00:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
to have rules within a building and we
 
00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:52.740 align:start position:0%
can't get away from that and
 
00:28:54.169 --> 00:28:54.179 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a lot of them coming out
 
00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
of covid they don't know what rules are
 
00:28:59.450 --> 00:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
and the parameters are now wider and
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
then they were pre-coveted
 
00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
and and that's part of what I believe
 
00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
we're we're encountering
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
not all of it but part of it
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering whether or not the
 
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
disciplinary records might be in data of
 
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
use to it because if people are acting
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
out there's some causality in there we
 
00:29:21.649 --> 00:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
we don't know what it is but it's there
 
00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
and the department collects that
 
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
information yeah
 
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
yeah it's aggregated though
 
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
represent Damon
 
00:29:33.169 --> 00:29:33.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
I have great respect for the need for
 
00:29:39.409 --> 00:29:39.419 align:start position:0%
data and for
 
00:29:42.049 --> 00:29:42.059 align:start position:0%
confirming that whatever is being done
 
00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
is effective
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
and I am also
 
00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
really feeling like we already have so
 
00:29:51.529 --> 00:29:51.539 align:start position:0%
much data that tells us how much of a
 
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
crisis we have
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
and we really need to be looking at what
 
00:30:00.769 --> 00:30:00.779 align:start position:0%
are we doing to address the crisis
 
00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:04.820 align:start position:0%
more than getting more data
 
00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:07.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying we shouldn't also get
 
00:30:07.559 --> 00:30:08.630 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying we shouldn't also get
data

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
but I'm hearing an awful lot of
 
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
conversation about surveys survey that
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
we have day of this data that
 
00:30:18.409 --> 00:30:18.419 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do to address the
 
00:30:18.419 --> 00:30:19.490 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do to address the
problem

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:30.260 align:start position:0%
yeah I was just saying that would be
 
00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:32.940 align:start position:0%
that would be part of the data it's not
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
what are the things but what is done
 
00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
what is effective what is not effective
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
that would be part of what
 
00:30:42.409 --> 00:30:42.419 align:start position:0%
well that's true but we're doing
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
something and so is it effective is it
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
not effective is this school doing
 
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
something that is effective and this
 
00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
school doing what is not effective and
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
can we look at that and then say this
 
00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
might be a better effective a more
 
00:31:00.409 --> 00:31:00.419 align:start position:0%
effective solution
 
00:31:00.419 --> 00:31:01.850 align:start position:0%
effective solution
representative

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
um I would think there's three parts the
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
mental health intervention the crisis
 
00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
part we've heard about today the pot we
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
started on today with the mental health
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
education and the curriculum that goes
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
to the background of the other things
 
00:31:15.789 --> 00:31:15.799 align:start position:0%
the third particularly you spoke about
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
is the leadership in the school uh and
 
00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:21.299 align:start position:0%
the and what the youngster going back
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
and discipline all those things and that
 
00:31:24.769 --> 00:31:24.779 align:start position:0%
leadership is critical but I think what
 
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
we've forgotten in that
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
peace is the parental support for the
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
leadership in the school and if you
 
00:31:33.769 --> 00:31:33.779 align:start position:0%
don't have parental support for the
 
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
leadership in the school then the least
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
of the school starts to diminish and and
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
shrivel up uh and is not effective ears
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
you are an effective administrator and I
 
00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:44.220 align:start position:0%
think that's that's like the other
 
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
hanging chat out there
 
00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.350 align:start position:0%
hanging chat out there
foreign

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
I guess too that's where the the
 
00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:52.740 align:start position:0%
communication between the teacher and
 
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:55.799 align:start position:0%
the home but also the administrator has
 
00:31:57.889 --> 00:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
to be a supportive of the staff within
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
that building and and if you're not
 
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
um then then it's going to go downhill
 
00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
real fast
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
uh I I can remember in a building that I
 
00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
had that I came in I think I mentioned
 
00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
this before where I collected all the
 
00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
report cards and found out the average
 
00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:17.940 align:start position:0%
grade and the school was like a minus in
 
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
a huge School
 
00:32:21.289 --> 00:32:21.299 align:start position:0%
I said well I didn't know our kids were
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
geniuses and then I went back to the
 
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
teachers and they said well you know the
 
00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
parents are looking for oh wait and I
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
said this a c is a c that's average
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
they're doing a pretty good job to get
 
00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
that but what happens when they come in
 
00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
and complain I said send them to me
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
and that's where the principal has to
 
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:43.740 align:start position:0%
stand up and say this is the expectation
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
of this school and that's the difference
 
00:32:48.769 --> 00:32:48.779 align:start position:0%
between schools which are Schools of
 
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:50.820 align:start position:0%
Excellence and those schools which are
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
just okay
 
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
and and I've I'm a firm believer that
 
00:32:57.289 --> 00:32:57.299 align:start position:0%
leadership and staff have to work
 
00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
together and but leadership has to be
 
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
there saying yeah this is a yes or this
 
00:33:05.049 --> 00:33:05.059 align:start position:0%
is a no and and and
 
00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:07.640 align:start position:0%
I guess I got my point across there
 
00:33:09.889 --> 00:33:09.899 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner did you see the
 
00:33:12.289 --> 00:33:12.299 align:start position:0%
two plus two video
 
00:33:15.409 --> 00:33:15.419 align:start position:0%
Rick no just make sure you get a copy of
 
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
it so I agree with representative
 
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
Woodcock that that we've got
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
um three at least three distinct areas
 
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
but I think one of the ones that we can
 
00:33:28.009 --> 00:33:28.019 align:start position:0%
focus on and try to really
 
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
um make a difference right away is
 
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
school climate and and the school
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
climate being you know the healthy
 
00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
habits of well-being uh number one good
 
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
leadership that that understands how
 
00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
important that is food every kid's not
 
00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.230 align:start position:0%
important that is food every kid's not
hungry

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
hungry
 
00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
um and having uh you know some of the
 
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
again going back to some of the
 
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
legislation legislative
 
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
decisions we've made uh that have been
 
00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
put into law that really restrict uh
 
00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:00.980 align:start position:0%
having a healthy climate in a school
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
being able to have a healthy climate in
 
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
the school but I think that's that's one
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
part that's not therapy okay that and
 
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
you've got to divide that up teachers
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
don't do therapy okay they but uh they
 
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
do as much social emotional uh help and
 
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
setting these areas for well-being and
 
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:26.700 align:start position:0%
trying to make the climate the best for
 
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
the child to learn and the best for the
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
child to grow and
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
represent Ford
 
00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
I think one of the things that we're
 
00:34:42.589 --> 00:34:42.599 align:start position:0%
stepping around without saying
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
is that a lot of the decisions that
 
00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
affect this are made in the communities
 
00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:50.940 align:start position:0%
in the way they're willing to fund the
 
00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:51.889 align:start position:0%
in the way they're willing to fund the
schools

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:51.899 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
and I have read School assignments where
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
you have certain number of special ed
 
00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:00.020 align:start position:0%
kids and they're all supposed to have
 
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
individualized education or
 
00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.670 align:start position:0%
individualized education or
help

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
and they're clustered together in one
 
00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
room under a teacher with a right
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
certification but they're taught as a
 
00:35:12.119 --> 00:35:13.190 align:start position:0%
certification but they're taught as a
group

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
and the time that they're taught that
 
00:35:20.089 --> 00:35:20.099 align:start position:0%
they count includes the time of walking
 
00:35:23.329 --> 00:35:23.339 align:start position:0%
from the other prior class to that class
 
00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:27.180 align:start position:0%
and so they played with the numbers
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
and the fact was the students didn't get
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
what they were supposed to get and it
 
00:35:35.329 --> 00:35:35.339 align:start position:0%
was a decision made largely apparently
 
00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:39.020 align:start position:0%
on budget reasons in the case I saw
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
and we've got to look at that question
 
00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
of is special ed something that we
 
00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
should fund from the state or at least
 
00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:52.140 align:start position:0%
assessed rather than say it's a local

school decision
 
00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.030 align:start position:0%
school decision
soup

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
soup
 
00:35:58.970 --> 00:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
did that education in general
 
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
you can't remember that special
 
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
education is a different ball game than
 
00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the classroom and the
 
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
the social emotional behavioral issues
 
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
in a classroom are not necessarily that
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
of special education and you have
 
00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
several categories there dealing with
 
00:36:17.089 --> 00:36:17.099 align:start position:0%
mental health you have other health
 
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
impaired which has exploded a little bit
 
00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:22.220 align:start position:0%
uh however
 
00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
the special education
 
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to congratulate special ed
 
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.569 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to congratulate special ed
teachers

00:36:29.569 --> 00:36:29.579 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
um the the the the way they're being put
 
00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
into these situations and they're having
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
to deal with and caseloads are
 
00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.790 align:start position:0%
to deal with and caseloads are
increasing

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:43.140 align:start position:0%
um difficulty of handling some of these
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
situations is beyond what I ever saw in
 
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
schools and and so I don't and and I
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
don't think we're side loading these
 
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
kids you were trying to mainstream those
 
00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
especially with disabilities in the
 
00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
classroom and and that's where we're
 
00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
coming up with the Paris and all uh so I
 
00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
I think we've gone by that hurdle I
 
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:04.740 align:start position:0%
think the issue we have is we got to get
 
00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
back to this bill itself there's several
 
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
bills what is a comprehensive mental
 
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
health program where to smell how are we
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
going to support mental health in the
 
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
classroom how are we going to prepare
 
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
teachers to do that and and what are
 
00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:22.140 align:start position:0%
those be the support services for the
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
teacher when you have to get
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
intervention beyond what the teachers
 
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
prepared and trained to provide
 
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
but I know that the the good teachers
 
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
I've always seen
 
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
they treat their classes almost like a
 
00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
family and they put money in the bank in
 
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
other words they put all that invested
 
00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
time in the bank and when they have to
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
pull it out with a kid there's there's
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
the kids willing to work with that
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
teacher and it becomes a situation
 
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty positive situation so a
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
lot of it I think comes from you know
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
those professional teachers and where'd
 
00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:55.380 align:start position:0%
they get that lot was on the job
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
training but there's also I don't I
 
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
don't know what's going on the on the
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
higher education level now whether we're
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
getting into things besides Knowledge
 
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
and Skills but we're also getting into
 
00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
the area with the pedagogy the the
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
ability to and the methods necessary to
 
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
work in today's education environment
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask those questions I I
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
think we can we I think we can fix
 
00:38:23.569 --> 00:38:23.579 align:start position:0%
things properly here it can be done uh
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's just going to take we need to spend
 
00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
a couple of months here whittling and
 
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
drilling down and unpacking this whole
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
thing and and trying to get all that's
 
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
proper and it's going to support and be
 
00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
and that's about what we can do as a
 
00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:44.940 align:start position:0%
legislature it's the rest is on
 
00:38:46.849 --> 00:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon the school districts and
 
00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
I believe leadership in those buildings
 
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
yeah Alicia
 
00:38:55.849 --> 00:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
I want to go back to what I learned
 
00:38:59.870 --> 00:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
SEL trainings and conferences and stuff
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
um about the importance of School parent
 
00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
and community and the question is what
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
can what can we do
 
00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.109 align:start position:0%
can what can we do
to

00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
try to form those bonds that have been
 
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
broken or that don't seem to exist in a
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
lot of places and there have been
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
communities in this state who worked
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
hard to get parent-teacher bonds and
 
00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:31.079 align:start position:0%
they had extremely successful SEL
 
00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
programs and the number of incidences in
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
the school decreased dramatically
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
you know behavioral instances Etc and so
 
00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
we've seen in the state schools that
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
have been effective
 
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
the question is what can we do
 
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
to encourage that across the state and
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
try to get those
 
00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.190 align:start position:0%
try to get those
um

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
programs or whatever we have
 
00:39:59.930 --> 00:39:59.940 align:start position:0%
schools who are very welcoming to
 
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
parents in schools that are not at all
 
00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
welcoming to parents they don't even
 
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
want parents in the buildings and how do
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
we fix that how do we rebuild those
 
00:40:11.089 --> 00:40:11.099 align:start position:0%
bridges like some of the districts have
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
done because I think that's what's going
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
to make a difference it's not a just
 
00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
school that's siloing again just school
 
00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
but how do we get out of the silo into
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:26.569 --> 00:40:26.579 align:start position:0%
you know what the schools that are doing
 
00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
it a good job
 
00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
what their best practices are what's
 
00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:32.220 align:start position:0%
their percentage of the parents
 
00:40:35.329 --> 00:40:35.339 align:start position:0%
attending the Parent-Teacher conferences
 
00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
um for one uh what are there any parent
 
00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
advisory councils within that school we
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
used to have them where I was and and we
 
00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.030 align:start position:0%
used to have them where I was and and we
listened

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
listened
 
00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.349 align:start position:0%
listened
um

00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different things which
 
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
I think you can count as best practice
 
00:40:56.569 --> 00:40:56.579 align:start position:0%
uh I I think a school that's locking
 
00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
parents out I don't think that's what
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.829 --> 00:41:06.839 align:start position:0%
but some yes I don't agree that schools
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
are locking parents out I uh when you do
 
00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
any kind of survey across the state
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
people like their Public Schools they
 
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
like their Community Schools if they
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
have kids in school they like the
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
schools they like the teachers okay it's
 
00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
it's National political propaganda that
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
kind of stirs the pot with a lot of
 
00:41:31.329 --> 00:41:31.339 align:start position:0%
things and also bringing up one case
 
00:41:34.849 --> 00:41:34.859 align:start position:0%
scenarios whenever you have an
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
institution whether it's a hospital or a
 
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
school any institution where you're
 
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
dealing with the public you're always
 
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
going to get some people who are just
 
00:41:47.089 --> 00:41:47.099 align:start position:0%
not satisfied with what's happening
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
maybe have some issues of their own or
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
some baggage about schools and their
 
00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:57.900 align:start position:0%
their um they'll say you know they're
 
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
they're locking me out when in fact we
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
don't know at the at the bottom level
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
what the actual details are I think
 
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
Schools public schools that I have
 
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
worked with that I now represent that I
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
have represented
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
bend over backwards to work with parents
 
00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:18.300 align:start position:0%
and and you're going to get one or two
 
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
parents that just it doesn't matter
 
00:42:23.569 --> 00:42:23.579 align:start position:0%
that's that's not good enough and so
 
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
um I think we have to stop looking at
 
00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:26.630 align:start position:0%
um I think we have to stop looking at
the

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
at the one outs the outliers and look at
 
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:38.569 --> 00:42:38.579 align:start position:0%
if you want to end I would just say it
 
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:40.140 align:start position:0%
is all about leadership
 
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
and it's the leadership that sets a tone
 
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
and makes the demands
 
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
it was just like I told them to the
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
standards I I agree with you and a
 
00:42:52.609 --> 00:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
hundred percent just yesterday across
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
the hallway the investigator
 
00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
for Department of Education was
 
00:43:00.349 --> 00:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
testifying on The subpoena powers that
 
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:03.540 align:start position:0%

00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
what month do you think that the
 
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
investigators notified more by parents
 
00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
we're in it right now
 
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
the school year is over now the parents
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
going to complain
 
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
and so the school that has the the the
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
the uh good best practices and openness
 
00:43:34.849 --> 00:43:34.859 align:start position:0%
I bet you that I I go to that
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
investigator and say okay what are the
 
00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:37.740 align:start position:0%

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
all the time or are are getting it from
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
verse which ones aren't you getting it
 
00:43:44.809 --> 00:43:44.819 align:start position:0%
from the ones you're not getting it from
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
are the ones which are open and working
 
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
with parents
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%

representative just said it's leadership
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
in that building setting the tone and
 
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
it's also the school board as well
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
working cooperatively together and it's
 
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
unfortunately apparently it must not be
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
happening everywhere
 
00:44:06.119 --> 00:44:12.290 align:start position:0%

foreign
 
00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
anything else just just a final question
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
oh we had a handout on House Bill 1236
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee
 
00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:47.220 align:start position:0%
um and I'm just questioning whether
 
00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
anybody knows there's no public hearings
 
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
on these standards north of Concord
 
00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
are they just not communicating with
 
00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:58.790 align:start position:0%
are they just not communicating with
someone

00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
are Concord okay that tells you are you
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
going to request one
 
00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:10.740 align:start position:0%
because I'd go to because I've been
 
00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
waiting to go to one of these and
 
00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
Poe sound like they wouldn't do it until
 
00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:36.849 align:start position:0%
