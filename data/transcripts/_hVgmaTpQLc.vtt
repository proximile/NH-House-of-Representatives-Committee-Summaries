business uh and my plan today
 
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
maybe because that's the way i'm
 
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
organized but uh in terms of the bills
 
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
from the lowest numbered bill to the
 
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 align:start position:0%

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 align:start position:0%

legislator on senate bill 216.
 
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
okay it's moved by
 
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative walper in expedient the
 
00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 align:start position:0%
legislature is there a second to that
 
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
i'll second it
 
00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative mclean would
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
you like to address your motion
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh yeah mr chairman
 
00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
the court is doing is doing this pilot
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
program for landlord tenant mediation
 
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
they reported it's working very very
 
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.870 align:start position:0%
they reported it's working very very
successfully

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
successfully
 
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
we didn't see any reason why they needed
 
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
a commission to find out how they're
 
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.070 align:start position:0%
a commission to find out how they're
doing

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
thank you is there other discussion with
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
regard to
 
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
representative d lorenzo
 
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr human and just to um
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
address the concerns that
 
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
my friend from stratford has um
 
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.749 align:start position:0%
my friend from stratford has um
the

00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:15.759 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
the program is a pilot program
 
00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:19.430 align:start position:0%
the program is a pilot program
um

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
initially and
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
we're looking at establishing a
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
committee to study the mediation program
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
in order to make it perhaps permanent if
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
the commission so wishes
 
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
now the bill would create a commission
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
to study the landlord tenant mediation
 
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
pilot program that has been going on in
 
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
the circuit courts the program was
 
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
developed by the circuit courts to help
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
landlords and tenants work through
 
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
issues to avoid an eviction mediation is
 
00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
not mandatory and both the landlord and
 
00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 align:start position:0%
tenant must agree on mediation
 
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:55.759 align:start position:0%
the pilot group program has been a great
 
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
success and has kept 80 percent of
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
tenants facing eviction in their homes
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
the study commission would provide the
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
general court with all relevant
 
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
stakeholders with an appropriate venue
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
to analyze the program
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
assess what is what has and has not
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
worked and recommend changes going
 
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.629 align:start position:0%
worked and recommend changes going
forward

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
the mediation approach is conciliatory
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
rather than punitive and could lead to
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
preservation of tenancy and prevent
 
00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:26.790 align:start position:0%
preservation of tenancy and prevent
homelessness

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
homelessness
 
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
now a lot of um
 
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.749 align:start position:0%
now a lot of um
jurisdictions

00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
throughout the country have what's
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
called a housing court
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
so this would be kind of a mini housing
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
court without the framework of a housing
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
court per se
 
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.509 align:start position:0%
court per se
um

00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
and it looks to resolve disputes and
 
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
namical full spec fashion and it's been
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
pretty successful throughout the country
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative other other
 
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.509 align:start position:0%
thank you representative other other
comments

00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
i just want to also underline did
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
anybody who sat through landlord-tenant
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
bill hearings know the
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
relationship between the
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
landlord landlord community
 
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
property owner community and the tenant
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
community is sometimes troubled and
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
even though i think both sides are
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
acting good face i think
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
the mediation program would be uh useful
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
especially right now when there's
 
00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:25.190 align:start position:0%
especially right now when there's
um

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
the prices are
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
prices are unaffordable for working
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
people and there's less than a one
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
percent vacancy rate so the um
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
this evens the balance a little bit
 
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.269 align:start position:0%
this evens the balance a little bit
where

00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
even though they don't seem pleased with
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
this current state of affairs the
 
00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:40.959 align:start position:0%
landlords do have like a very uh you
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
know it is a seller's market for them
 
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
and they have a very favorable position
 
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.070 align:start position:0%
and they have a very favorable position
so

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.030 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
so it's uh that's why i think this uh
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
this i think this commission is useful
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
even though it's only going to meet a
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none okay so we're ready to vote
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%

00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
alexander to make senate bill 217
 
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate and would you
 
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
like to address your motion
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
yes indeed uh thank you i
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
it everybody knows that we have a
 
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
tremendous problem with the housing and
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
rental units in the state
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt about that
 
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
and everything that
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
imposes more restrictions on properties
 
00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:47.269 align:start position:0%
imposes more restrictions on properties
reduces

00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
reduces
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
the number of apartments that are going
 
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
to be available
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
this bill would
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
discourage landlords from buying
 
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.310 align:start position:0%
discourage landlords from buying
apartments

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
apartments
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
and in fact would encourage landlords to
 
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
sell their properties and perhaps turn
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
them into just single-family homes if
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
they are single families so
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
this really takes
 
00:13:08.959 --> 00:13:10.550 align:start position:0%
this really takes
uh

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
the wrong approach
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
it's well intended to no doubt but
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
the actual effect
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
economics is
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
undeniable it will cause
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
higher rents and less available
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
apartments so
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
while it's uh it may seem like it it
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
does good for uh folks that are renting
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
it it actually will have the reverse
 
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.230 align:start position:0%
it it actually will have the reverse
effect

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
representative smith

we differ
 
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.069 align:start position:0%
we differ
um

00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
let's let's move out of manchester
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
nashua southern
 
00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and go up to the lakes
 
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
region just for example i'll pick the
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
lakes region
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
in the lakes region there is a landlord
 
00:14:09.199 --> 00:14:10.430 align:start position:0%
in the lakes region there is a landlord
with

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
370 apartments
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know about you but 370
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
apartments is really to me very big for
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:21.350 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
um

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
the executive director of this program
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
wrote to us to express support
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
for sb217t
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
for the same reasons that were mentioned
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
but different conclusions
 
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.110 align:start position:0%
but different conclusions
um

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
as you all know in in her letter to her
 
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
she said the rental market's extremely
 
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
tight it can take a household several
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
months to find a new apartment giving
 
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
people who face eviction through no
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
fault of their own
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
more time to relocate is the right thing
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
we know that there's a good chance the
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
tenants in this situation can end up
 
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.710 align:start position:0%
tenants in this situation can end up
homeless

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
homeless
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
simply due to the lack of available
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
rental apartments and when they're
 
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.870 align:start position:0%
rental apartments and when they're
homeless

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
they begin to fall through the rabbit
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
hole and have significantly more
 
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
problems that come back
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
to haunt
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
those of us who are more fortunate and
 
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
those of us by the way who pay taxes in
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
our cities and towns
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
with the mover of the motion and

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
vote down the itl motion so that
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
we could um
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
move to otp
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
other questions or comments

well

well
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
you know the the prime driver of this
 
00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.710 align:start position:0%
you know the the prime driver of this
bill

00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
um 217 to relative to eviction notices
 
00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.150 align:start position:0%
um 217 to relative to eviction notices
was

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
was um
 
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.550 align:start position:0%
was um
drawn

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
drawn
 
00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
to address
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
housing changes like
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
condominium conversion
 
00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:18.870 align:start position:0%
condominium conversion
um

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
or real rehabilitation of
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:24.959 --> 00:16:26.150 align:start position:0%
 
which

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
the tenants have to move out of the
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
building so that it can be rehabilitated
 
00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
so what's happened often is that once
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
tenants move out um
 
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.230 align:start position:0%
tenants move out um
the

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
building is rehabbed and then
 
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
if it had if it had like a lot of um
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
low-income tenants those low-income
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
tenants would not be able to move back
 
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
into the property virtually making them
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
um potentially homeless
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
so the reason for this bill is to give
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
the tenants more time
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
to make other housing arrangements
 
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
and that's all it is
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
so it comes up when um
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
a tenant design a landlord decides to
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
sell a property and the tenant has to
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
move also when the landlord needs to do
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
substantial rehabilitation or
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
when the
 
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:17.839 align:start position:0%
unit is taken off the market because of
 
00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:19.110 align:start position:0%
unit is taken off the market because of
um

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
oh boy
 
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
conditions that
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
make the unit inhabitable so it's kind
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
of a um what they call a construct
 
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.590 align:start position:0%
of a um what they call a construct
constructive

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
constructive
 
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
eviction of the tenant
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
because they have to move
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
and in those instances the tenants
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
usually don't have any other place to go
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
so i fully support this bill and i hope
 
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
that you all will as well thank you
 
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
other comments representative wolper
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh i have to
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
say that
 
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
maybe the only thing that we really
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
heard both sides testified to
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
during this hearing
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
i want to say disingenuously use
 
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.270 align:start position:0%
i want to say disingenuously use
this

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
provision of the law
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
to avoid
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
the lengthy
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
process of normal eviction which only
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
that if that's true and both sides said
 
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
then adopting this legislation will have
 
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.430 align:start position:0%
then adopting this legislation will have
a

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
much larger effect
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
on the reduction
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
of available housing for renters
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
landlords and potential landlords from
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
entering the market
 
00:18:47.679 --> 00:18:48.470 align:start position:0%
entering the market
and

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
encourage them others
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know it just just
 
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
won't work it sounds good it won't work
 
00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
representative horgan um
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you the
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
um i
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
actually have the notes in front of me
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
of all the people came in and testified
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
and it was um
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
pretty much as you would expect
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire apartment association
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
was against it and the realtors against
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
and everybody else
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
recognized that this was a additional
 
00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
protection for tenants who already
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
huge disadvantage in this seller's
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
market and
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
even the objections of the pro landlord
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
side were fairly muted because eviction
 
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
already is a difficult process that
 
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
takes a lot longer than the nominal time
 
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.270 align:start position:0%
takes a lot longer than the nominal time
which

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
it can be as little the nominal time
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
results seven days if this passes to be
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
60 days but it always takes a lot longer
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
than the nominal time and i um
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
i personally don't have a big big big
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
big problem with that um
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
and in this parenthetically um we always
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
say well we should be encouraging
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
landlords we'd be encouraged to build a
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
more rental property and we've rarely
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
have ever seen any bills at least in
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
that encourage rental property um
 
00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:06.149 align:start position:0%
that encourage rental property um
although

00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
although
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
these bills relay that to go to other
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
committees and we actually was
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
a thing in the newspaper where there is
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%
some initiative going forward through
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
joint fiscal which probably using
 
00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.470 align:start position:0%
joint fiscal which probably using
uh

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
one-time federal funds but i just feel a
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
little bit embarrassed that uh you know
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
we haven't
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
i just feel sorry a little bit left out
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
that we've never seen any bills in this
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
committee actually encouraging uh
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
people to build more property it's
 
00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:32.799 align:start position:0%
always uh
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
that every time we do anything
 
00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.630 align:start position:0%
that every time we do anything
particular

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
tenants it's uh but anyway i've said
 
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
enough about it but yeah i think uh
 
00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
i think this bill uh will not harm the
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
landlords much you know do a little bit
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
to help the tenants anyway
 
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
thanks representative macbeth
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
thank you chair gordon and i wanted to
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
respond to something i'm not sure if i
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
heard my colleague correct i just wanted
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
to clarify and this is not legal advice
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
but the eviction process does take
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
longer than 30 days i think the initial
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
response window may be 30 days
 
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
but then there are
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
at least 30 more days maybe to get to
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
court 30 more days to correct i mean i'm
 
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
trying to look up right now on new
 
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire legally websites but it's i
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
think i did hear that testimony as well
 
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.789 align:start position:0%
think i did hear that testimony as well
and

00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
the reason why both sides were saying
 
00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.149 align:start position:0%
the reason why both sides were saying
that

00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
um sometimes if it happens
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
landlords would use the uh renovation or
 
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.510 align:start position:0%
landlords would use the uh renovation or
sell

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
sell
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
is you know
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
issue to get someone out it's because
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
it's a lot easier than the eviction
 
00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.070 align:start position:0%
it's a lot easier than the eviction
notice

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
notice
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
representative mclean
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
i'm very sympathetic to this bill in
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
many ways because uh when i was a young
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
couple with my wife living in new york
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
we went through this scenario
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
single income the rent goes from 950 to
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
1500 and we're out okay so but we have
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
to be careful that you know coming from
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
a place of compassion that we don't do
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
more harm
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
the the demand side in new hampshire
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
right now is super hot
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
but the struggle is really on the supply
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
side and actually we have done things in
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
this committee we've looked at the
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board we're going to
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
interim study the land use docket and
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
we're not approaching this problem in a
 
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
vacuum there are other agencies that are
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
attacking this as well but i think what
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
we have to do is we're in a very
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
delicate situation i don't think we
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
really want to upset anything we want to
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
give some of these initiatives an
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to run for a little while
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
assess that and
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
bringing forth this kind of legislation
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
at this time may actually be
 
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.789 align:start position:0%
at this time may actually be
counterproductive

00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
other questions or comments
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
i just i just want to say that you know
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
i've really been torn on a bill because
 
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
you know on its face you say well geez
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
given our circumstances right now giving
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
what's the harm and but
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
then i look at what the purpose of it is
 
00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.390 align:start position:0%
then i look at what the purpose of it is
and

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
and the purpose is to say well people
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
need an additional 30 days because they
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
may have another they have more need to
 
00:23:19.039 --> 00:23:21.110 align:start position:0%
may have another they have more need to
relocate

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
relocate
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
but the other side of that having sat in
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
the court is judges right now have the
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
discretion when someone is when you
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
determine somebody should be evicted to
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
give them up to 90 days
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
and to make a determination of the
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
amount of time somebody actually needs
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
to relocate
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
and judges can do that today and it
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
seems to me what this bill is intending
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
is take that discretion away from the
 
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.350 align:start position:0%
is take that discretion away from the
judge

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
judge
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
and say
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
judge you have to give them another 30
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
days on top of the 90 days that you can
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
give them
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
and of course what we heard in the
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
testimony when we asked the question
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
about that was well judges aren't given
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
the 90 days they're only given the 30
 
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
days well i'm presuming they're giving
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
the time that they feel
 
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.630 align:start position:0%
the time that they feel
that

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
the tenant needs in order to relocate or
 
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
they should be and if they aren't maybe
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's where the problem needs to be
 
00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.269 align:start position:0%
that's where the problem needs to be
addressed

00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
not in the not in
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
taking away the discretion
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
but in
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
making sure that judges are
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
appropriately giving the people the time
 
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
that they need up to the 90 days that
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
they need so i guess when it came down
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
on the balance i thought that
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
the itl was probably the appropriate
 
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:42.149 align:start position:0%
the itl was probably the appropriate
recommendation

00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative chase
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and actually i just
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
want to uh clarify with yours so are you
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
saying if this were to go through you
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
feel that the
 
00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
the bill would take away from the judge
 
00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
already being able to give 30 days i
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
mean 90 days and it would just say no
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
now the law is
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
no it would not take away from the judge
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
basically what you'd be doing is giving
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
the tenant 150 days
 
00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:15.669 align:start position:0%
the tenant 150 days
okay

00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
up to 150 days depending on what the
 
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.830 align:start position:0%
 
anybody

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
else if not i think we could vote
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
for mr clerk
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%

so uh yeah mr chairman uh
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
so my first problem with this bill is i
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
don't like the idea at all of writing um
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
exceptions into the right to know law
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
the right to no law has applied to
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
everybody in the state
 
00:27:57.679 --> 00:27:59.269 align:start position:0%

and
 
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
this is just an exception we have
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
another bill with another exception and
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
we have another bill that makes an
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
exception for the general court and i
 
00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
don't think we should just be writing
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
exception after exception after
 
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
exception into the right to noah
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
the bill has other problems the way it's
 
00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.190 align:start position:0%
the bill has other problems the way it's
constructed

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
constructed
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
so i just don't think we should be doing
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
it and
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
want to make it inexpedient to legislate
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
other comments or questions
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um this is one as
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
as our distinguished clerk notes this is
 
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
one of a number of bills that we have
 
00:28:39.279 --> 00:28:40.149 align:start position:0%
one of a number of bills that we have
all

00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
trying to do the same thing
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
come out of our culvert experience
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
in the covet experience when we were
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
able to have
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
when particularly
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
well when everyone
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
was able to have uh remote meetings
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
we found universally that many more
 
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
people in the public participated many
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
more people in the public understood
 
00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.710 align:start position:0%
more people in the public understood
what

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
how complicated it is to run government
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
and it also made it possible for members
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
of boards commissions councils whatever
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm staying away here from the
 
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
general court
 
00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
were able to participate
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
remotely with somewhat more ease than
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
they could this is particularly notable
 
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.350 align:start position:0%
they could this is particularly notable
because

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
we have a state that is
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
built longitudinally and most of the
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
population is in the south and many
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
people have long distances to travel
 
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.029 align:start position:0%
people have long distances to travel
if

00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:51.039 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
some of us had our way
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
we would address this the way we tried
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
to address it last year in a very
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
reasonable consistent way
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
not picking away bit by bit not looking
 
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
at one agency or one
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
one department
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
but really saying universally in the
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire in order to
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
increase public participation and make
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
it easier for volunteers to work on
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
boards and commissions we would permit
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
with certain guidelines
 
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh distance participation i for example
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
think that the chair must be at a site
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
and there must be a physical sign and
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
there should be a certain number of
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
people there um
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
that is does not at the moment seem to
 
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
catch the attention and the enthusiasm
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
of a majority of of members and
 
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.039 align:start position:0%
we recognize this
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
i and a number of my colleagues will on
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
each of these bills not support itl not
 
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
because we think these bills are
 
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
wonderful but
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
barring the opportunity to address this
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
in a reasonable rational way
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
we pick at the little pieces
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
um i don't think there's any reason for
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
me to repeat
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
what i've just said on the two or three
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
or four subsequent bills that are all
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
the same argument and so i just wanted
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
to make it now in the interests of time
 
00:31:28.399 --> 00:31:30.070 align:start position:0%
to make it now in the interests of time
and

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
save you all from boredom but that is
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
why i um
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
i would oppose the itl not that i think
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is anyone's
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
gift to the state
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
but because um
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
barred from doing something more
 
00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.630 align:start position:0%
barred from doing something more
reasonable

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to pick away at it
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.750 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
i just do
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh yes mr chairman
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
representative wolper
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
so thank you and i have to agree totally
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
with my honorable colleague from durham
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
uh it would be way better if we could
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
find a real solution to this and we have
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
a bill
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
which we'll get to later and also i'm
 
00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
going to recommend ito on that
 
00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:22.230 align:start position:0%
going to recommend ito on that
[Laughter]

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
it comes that comes pretty close
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
to what we need for a solution
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
pretty close it's only got like three
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
significant flaws
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
these other bills have many more
 
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:40.870 align:start position:0%
these other bills have many more
right

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
and the problem is that the right to
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
know act is has has a lot of parts to it
 
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
and when you start playing with one part
 
00:32:49.519 --> 00:32:51.669 align:start position:0%
and when you start playing with one part
it

00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't fit anymore
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
and then i'm conflicting with other
 
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.509 align:start position:0%
and then i'm conflicting with other
parts

00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
parts
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
so that's why i'm voting against all
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh i'm hopeful that the
 
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 481 we passed and sent to the
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
senate will uh enact put in place the
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
ombudsman at the right general
 
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
commission recommended and will be a
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
major step toward resolving all of this
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
but for right now
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none mr clerk uh would you like
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
to take the role this is on senate bill
 
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
222 an act permitting licensing boards
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
to conduct remote meetings the motion is
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%

senate bill 243 an act permitting
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
transfer on death deeds for real
 
00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.710 align:start position:0%
transfer on death deeds for real
property

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative mclean do you have a
 
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
motion i make a motion of interim study
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
and i'll second that motion
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
and is there
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
would you like to address your motion
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i think uh
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
both sides on this bill
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
recognized that there was some value in
 
00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.870 align:start position:0%
recognized that there was some value in
having

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
an alternate way to to transfer property
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
at death and that's indicated by the
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
fact that 29 states and the district of
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
columbia have already done this but this
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
particular legislation um has a lot of
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
gaps in it
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.430 align:start position:0%
and um
uh

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
notification receipt disclaiming and
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
then a lot of testimony about undue
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
influence things of this nature
 
00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons really i think
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
we've got to get together and clean up
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
the bill before we can go forward thank
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
yeah representative lorenzo i agree that
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
the bill needs more work
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
i think i was particularly um
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
surprised to see that
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
folks could do this type of deed
 
00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.829 align:start position:0%
folks could do this type of deed
and

00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:23.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:23.839 --> 00:36:25.349 align:start position:0%
and
unwittingly

00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
unwittingly
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
the beneficiary doesn't know anything
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
about it until the person passes away
 
00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.829 align:start position:0%
about it until the person passes away
and

00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:31.839 --> 00:36:32.630 align:start position:0%
and
with

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
that that you know transfer of the
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
property the
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
beneficiary ends up picking up all of
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
the encumbrances wrapped up into the
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
property which could cost them money and
 
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
could get them into a lot of trouble so
 
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
i agree thank you
 
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
we have a motion of
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
interim study this is on senate bill 243
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
and mr clerk would you like to take the
 
00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.790 align:start position:0%
and mr clerk would you like to take the
role

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
on the q on the question of uh
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%

00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
my mouth is stuck on an expedient
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:29.680 align:start position:0%

296 of interim study and would you like
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
to address your motion yeah thank you mr
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
chair so i think that um everybody
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
agrees that all parties
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
in a claim before the human rights
 
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.589 align:start position:0%
in a claim before the human rights
commission

00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
should have
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
their full due process rights um
 
00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:01.829 align:start position:0%
their full due process rights um
but

00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
the the supreme court has ruled that um
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
it is the claimant
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
that gets to choose the forum and i
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
think the the testimony that was most
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
compelling for me
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
in the public hearing was the fact that
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
all of the removal from the commission
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
to the um
 
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
to the superior court last year was done
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
by the respondent and not by the
 
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
claimant and that's not the case every
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
year um but the majority of the removal
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
is by the respondent so that that de
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
facto takes away
 
00:39:37.599 --> 00:39:38.630 align:start position:0%
facto takes away
um

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
the right of the claimant essentially to
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
to choose the form
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
the reason i think that we have to look
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
at interim study
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
as opposed to just an ought to pass
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
motion on this
 
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
is because we heard testimony uh from uh
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
some of some of the attorneys for the
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
employers that we're talking about
 
00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
five years to
 
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
a probable cause finding and as as the
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
chair said justice delayed is justice
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
denied so if you're a claimant before
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
the commission and you have to wait five
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
years you're basically
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
potentially under a lot of pressure from
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
your employer at that time waiting for
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
that to come forward and if you're
 
00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.309 align:start position:0%
that to come forward and if you're
someone

00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
and the claim is not legitimate and
 
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
you're actually innocent
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
you're under that cloud for five years
 
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.309 align:start position:0%
you're under that cloud for five years
and

00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of reputational damage
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
that can happen in that time so i really
 
00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:33.829 align:start position:0%
that can happen in that time so i really
think

00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
before we go and we just remove take
 
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
away that right of removal we have got
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
to address
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
some of those issues
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
around the commission and i think this
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
is an opportunity to do that
 
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
this would be a real interim study
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
and i would be excited to work on it
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
with a bipartisan group and i hope you
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
other comments representative macbeth
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you chair gordon um i agree with
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative mclean i think that there
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
are really some issues here that were
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
good that were brought forward and um
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
but some work on it would be the best so
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
we can support interim study on that
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you

00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
no reflection on the executive director
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
of the human rights commission i think
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
she's doing a fabulous job with what she
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
has to work with
 
00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:30.710 align:start position:0%
has to work with
um

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:31.510 align:start position:0%
um
but

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
i feel like the commission is a paper
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
tiger and it should be revamped or
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
absorbed by the ag office a study of
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
best practices from other states for
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
instance maine or massachusetts
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
could be warranted i also think the
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
concept of a volunteer board making
 
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:50.079 align:start position:0%
critical decisions about lies and
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
livelihoods is perhaps mistaken
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
the current board may be okay but but
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
commission by design is left open to the
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
governor appointing
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
people who may not be up to the
 
00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.710 align:start position:0%
people who may not be up to the
challenge

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
that defeats the purpose and intent of
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
having a viable transparent and robust
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
commission thank you
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comments anyone else
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
wish to comment represent mclean
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
yeah and i just want to reiterate um
 
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
representative renzo's comments that
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
again my comments were no reflection on
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
the director of the human rights
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
commission who gave excellent testimony
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
just to add to
 
00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
add to the issue of and again
 
00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
not focus at the director but at the
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
structure of the human rights commission
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
i just think it's
 
00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.829 align:start position:0%
i just think it's
abominable

00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839 align:start position:0%
abominable
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
that we should find ourselves in
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances where it takes
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
five years to resolve these types of
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
complaints i think we should be
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
embarrassed by that
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
frankly and
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
the the other
 
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
the other one thing that i'd add to it
 
00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.150 align:start position:0%
the other one thing that i'd add to it
is

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh clearly that if we were to pass this
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
legislation it would mean more work for
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
without any additional resources
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
to address that work and just extend
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
those time frames and it which doesn't
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
make any sense so i i agree there needs
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
to be a fix and it needs to be a fix for
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
the commission and hopefully we can do
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
so you know when i'll wait till i get a
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
we have before us a motion it's a motion
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 296
 
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%

bill but i'm happy interim study i'll
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative horrigan
 
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
so we've adopted the recommendation on
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
296 of interim study and we'll buy a
 
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
vote of 20 to 1 and we'll put that on
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 297 an act relative to
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
obtaining out-of-state discovery and
 
00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.550 align:start position:0%
obtaining out-of-state discovery and
testimony

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
and i'd make a motion about to pass on
 
00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:23.430 align:start position:0%
and i'd make a motion about to pass on
that

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
kurt would you mind seconding that i
 
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.030 align:start position:0%
 
i've

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
i've
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
senate bill 297 is a very simple bill i
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
heard the bill
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
that right now
 
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
if you want to do or take
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh a deposition from another
 
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction it requires to support the
 
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
superior court to appoint
 
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
a commissioner in order to do that and
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
what this bill
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
basically does is allow
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
for that deposition to be taken from a
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
foreign jurisdiction according to the
 
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
laws of that jurisdiction without having
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
to appoint a commissioner
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
and it's typically of what other states
 
00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:09.829 align:start position:0%
and it's typically of what other states
do

00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
and it would be much more efficient
 
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.430 align:start position:0%
and it would be much more efficient
process

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.630 align:start position:0%
process
and

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
certainly would recommend not to pass
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
seeing then i guess we can take a vote
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
this is uh this is on senate bill 297
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
with a motion of ought to pass
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
mr clerk
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%

negative move consent

on consent
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%

481 which is in the senate right now
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
um this bill the underlying bill would
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%

to address grievances under the right to
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
know law by um

the bill with um

h the text of hb 481 to just assert our

position that this is probably the best
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
way to go on the house side um and i
 
00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:08.800 align:start position:0%

conversations with the senate on the
 
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
best way to move forward on grievances
 
00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
under the right to know law
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%

chairman gordon you can always step in
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
to clarify as needed if i go off the
 
00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:38.150 align:start position:0%
to clarify as needed if i go off the
tracks

00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
tracks
 
00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:40.799 align:start position:0%
so the first thing is um if you look at
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:43.589 align:start position:0%
the original bill
um

00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
go to page one line ten
 
00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.710 align:start position:0%
go to page one line ten
so

00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
the the the change the first change in
 
00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
amendment uh 1443 h is just to address a
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
drafting error coming over from the
 
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
senate amendment
 
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
which basically says notwithstanding any
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
law and subject to paragraph 91
 
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
c colon 2. so that just is clarifying uh
 
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
the part of 91
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
that is relevant
 
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
then going on to uh page
 
00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:16.630 align:start position:0%
then going on to uh page
two

00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:17.990 align:start position:0%
two
um

00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
page to
 
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
go to uh
 
00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:28.309 align:start position:0%
go to uh
line

00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:55:28.319 --> 00:55:35.990 align:start position:0%
line
anyone

00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
so page 2 line 36 so this is this is in
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
this is in the exemption section so
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
there's roman 5
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
but directly beneath that roman 5
 
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
you can see the addition of roman 6 in
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
which basically
 
00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:58.230 align:start position:0%
which basically
gives

00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
gives
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
oversight function with the
 
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
administration of any government grant
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
program and that was requested by hhs
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
and if you go down
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
to line 16
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
right beneath that
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
so i have on a
 
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
b and c
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
the next thing is with respect to the
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
board of directors transparency you're
 
00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:28.799 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
adding a d
 
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
section and that section is
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
going to say as you can see in the
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
amendment a request by the attorney
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
general for the identity of any director
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
officer incorporator or registered agent
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
of a non-profit organization
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera
 
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
basically you know
 
00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:47.910 align:start position:0%
basically you know
just

00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
allowing the charitable trust to do his
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
job allowing the investigation of shams
 
00:56:55.109 --> 00:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
sham charities uh anything of that
 
00:56:55.119 --> 00:56:56.150 align:start position:0%
sham charities uh anything of that
nature

00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
nature
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
then directly
 
00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
beneath that
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to introduce roman 3
 
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
and that basically addresses the
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
concerns of the lottery commission with
 
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
respect to charitable gaming
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
you know nothing in the chapter shall
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
apply to request a lottery commission
 
00:57:14.549 --> 00:57:14.559 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the authority under et
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
cetera et cetera for the purposes of
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
licensing or regulation of charitable
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
gaming activities
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:23.910 align:start position:0%
um and so
that

00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
basically addresses the concern that was
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
brought forth by the lottery commission
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
so um and
 
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
the last thing
 
00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:34.549 align:start position:0%
the last thing
is

00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
with respect to the penalty phase
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
the misdemeanor
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
and imprisonment
 
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
portion that is removed
 
00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:46.549 align:start position:0%
portion that is removed
so

00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
that basically
 
00:57:48.079 --> 00:57:49.990 align:start position:0%
that basically
is

00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of working parts to that
 
00:57:51.839 --> 00:57:52.870 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of working parts to that
amendment

00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
so um but based on the public testimony
 
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
that we heard looking at the hhs
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
concerns the ag concerns lottery
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
commissions concerns
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
we think that this amendment has
 
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
basically addressed the bulk of that and
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
mr chair did you have anything to add to
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
that or
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
no other than my major concern i think
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
was the testimony from the ag's office
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
and my concern was
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
because everybody that testified
 
00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.030 align:start position:0%
because everybody that testified
testified

00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
testified
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:21.589 align:start position:0%
i think
that

00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
the names of donors shouldn't be
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
released and i think generally i can
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
agree with that
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
but it went further than that it talked
 
00:58:29.119 --> 00:58:30.390 align:start position:0%
but it went further than that it talked
about

00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
not disclosing the names of any
 
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
volunteers and
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
certainly the
 
00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
board members of most of these
 
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations are volunteers
 
00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
and so if you
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
if the charitable trust
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
unit has responsibility for
 
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
making sure that
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
board members are carrying out their
 
00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:55.839 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duties and doing it properly
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
they need to have the names of board
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
members and i wanted to make sure that
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
they would be able to have access to
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
that more than anything else
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
and i didn't think that the original
 
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
bill did that
 
00:59:08.789 --> 00:59:08.799 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
the language in here at least was
 
00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:12.150 align:start position:0%
the language in here at least was
intended

00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
intended
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
to address that particular the portion
 
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
of the of this amendment was intended to
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
address that to
 
00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
so like i said so i think everybody
 
00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
agrees donor privacy is an important
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
issue that should be addressed and
 
00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:28.630 align:start position:0%
issue that should be addressed and
hopefully

00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
with the amendment and the changes to
 
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
address those concerns i hope that the
 
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
committee will support the amendment and
 
00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
a motion of ought to pass as amended
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo mr chairman just
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
following up on
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
what you had said about board members
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
as volunteers being identified are so am
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
i to think that
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
board members are providing in-kind
 
00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:54.230 align:start position:0%
board members are providing in-kind
services

00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
which you know ordinarily could be
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
translated into dollar amounts but does
 
00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.390 align:start position:0%
translated into dollar amounts but does
that

01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
compel you to think that way
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
it's typical for
 
01:00:07.839 --> 01:00:08.789 align:start position:0%
it's typical for
for

01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations 501 c 3
 
01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:13.839 align:start position:0%
organizations to have board members that
 
01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
aren't paid
 
01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
that would make them in effect
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
volunteers or providing their services
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
as a board member as a volunteer
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
yes i'm i'm sure this amendment is going
 
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
to pass it does uh
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
as i said it does address a number of
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
objections that were raised the the bill
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
but i think i'm personally still going
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
to vote no on it because i think the
 
01:00:39.839 --> 01:00:41.270 align:start position:0%
to vote no on it because i think the
entire

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
entire
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
bill is unnecessary so i think the uh
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
there are the protections that are in
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
place are
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
are sufficient and
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
of course organizations can only
 
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
the 501c3 is uh accompanied by you know
 
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
a political action committee or a
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
similar uh thing for doing um
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
or a similar entity for doing certain
 
01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
types of uh the activities of the
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
organizations i i think this is
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
unnecessary it's also uh
 
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
primarily a
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
this is primarily about the federal tax
 
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
code and of course um so that's not
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
really a state concern since we don't
 
01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.789 align:start position:0%
really a state concern since we don't
even

01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
even
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
have a state income tax so i'm going to
 
01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
say so i'm just so i'm just going to be
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
a naysayer and vote no on the amendment
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
although i do appreciate the work they
 
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
went into and necessarily does make
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
a bill that i'm not crazy about less
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
objectionable but
 
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.829 align:start position:0%
objectionable but
thanks

01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:01:35.839 --> 01:01:36.829 align:start position:0%
thanks
other

01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
i think the amendment is
 
01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
is a significant improvement over a very
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
bad bill
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
i intend to vote for the amendment um
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
and the off chance
 
01:02:04.319 --> 01:02:05.109 align:start position:0%
and the off chance
that

01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
the bill actually passes i would at
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
least like it to be
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
less bad
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
and i see that as my obligation to the
 
01:02:17.829 --> 01:02:17.839 align:start position:0%
committee and to the
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
i'd like to point out that although this
 
01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
does talk about
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
501 c of the internal revenue code
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
it does not
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
talk about any of the um subparts of 501
 
01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
c for example three
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
which many of us are familiar with and
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
you know i've already mentioned you know
 
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
the durham historic association and i'm
 
01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
pleased to report that i have filed the
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
annual report and paid my 75 dollars
 
01:02:52.319 --> 01:02:53.109 align:start position:0%
annual report and paid my 75 dollars
um

01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
so you know
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
don't worry about me i'm in good shape
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
um and and most are most
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
most are but this includes all the other
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
subparts of 501c and that includes um
 
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
those uh
 
01:03:12.549 --> 01:03:12.559 align:start position:0%
organizations which have formed
 
01:03:12.559 --> 01:03:14.950 align:start position:0%
organizations which have formed
ostensibly

01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
ostensibly
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
under the overarching of 501 c but then
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
go on to do other kinds of things
 
01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:23.750 align:start position:0%
go on to do other kinds of things
that

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
are legal as long as they're reported
 
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
when people
 
01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.029 align:start position:0%
when people
um

01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
function in tax-exempt organizations
 
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
there is no free lunch
 
01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
the citizens of the state in this case
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
or of the country are paying
 
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.750 align:start position:0%
or of the country are paying
because

01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
those organizations are not paying
 
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
their taxes and we make a judgment that
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
when organizations are working for the
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
public good
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
they should be freed from tax taxation
 
01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.390 align:start position:0%
they should be freed from tax taxation
responsibilities

01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
and that is is a
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
a laudable
 
01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.990 align:start position:0%
a laudable
um

01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
a laudable position
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
but other other subparts under 501c are
 
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
in activities which aren't charitable
 
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
and educational
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
and move much more towards the partisan
 
01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.950 align:start position:0%
and move much more towards the partisan
political

01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
political
 
01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.630 align:start position:0%
political
and

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
and i believe that the rest of us
 
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
paying for their operation because
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
they're not paying taxes
 
01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:38.630 align:start position:0%
they're not paying taxes
um

01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
i think this is not a question of a
 
01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
personal privacy act
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
um i think it's a question of it's been
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
proposed and argued by people trying to
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
protect their own
 
01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
interests which might not necessarily be
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
for the public good so i have intentions
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
to vote for the amendment
 
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
and i i would be thrilled if you would
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
all then vote against the bill but just
 
01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
in case at least the amendment would
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
make this a little
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
less bad thank you
 
01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your comments
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%

i guess we can do a show of hands unless
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
somebody prefers to have a role
 
01:05:47.039 --> 01:05:48.230 align:start position:0%
somebody prefers to have a role
okay

01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:48.240 align:start position:0%

01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
i could con
 
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
some of you maybe to go with interim
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
study because there are things that need
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
to be changed and even this amendment
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
which i appreciate we got that last
 
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
night um there's there's some things
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
that i would i would like to add to it
 
01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.710 align:start position:0%
that i would i would like to add to it
um

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
one being the attorney general's right
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
to enforce the um political contribution
 
01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
um that section i think was 447 but
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
just four brief points i mean we've
 
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
heard that this really is a problem
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
i mean it's a bill looking to solve a
 
01:07:11.109 --> 01:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
problem that doesn't exist we heard from
 
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
the there's testimony that there's been
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
no chilling effect on the contributions
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire to non-profits and
 
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations actually last
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
year was the largest year that they
 
01:07:24.309 --> 01:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
could remember
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
number two
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
this doesn't just go to charitable
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
organizations it's to any non-profit and
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
so that's significant because those are
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
um you know very pointed toward
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
different issues and policies
 
01:07:36.319 --> 01:07:37.109 align:start position:0%
different issues and policies
um

01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:38.069 --> 01:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
really thing is this bill breaches the
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
underlying principle of why it was
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
established that nonprofits would get
 
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
the tax exemption and that their donors
 
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
would um and it was the transparency
 
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
that they would be able to prove that
 
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
these um funds were going for public
 
01:07:53.359 --> 01:07:54.230 align:start position:0%
these um funds were going for public
good

01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:07:57.270 --> 01:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
and just since the the our hearing i
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
want to draw your attention to the
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor of new york democrat
 
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
i believe who was um you know uh he's
 
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
been indicted by the fbi or the mid
 
01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
charges brought forth and as i
 
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
understand it from the new york times
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
and again i'm you know i know the truth
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
of the press but um one of the big
 
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
issues was there was fifty thousand
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
dollars that he when he was the
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
comptroller of the state that he
 
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
directed toward a non-profit and then
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
that non-profit made contributions
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
political contributions to his campaign
 
01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
which because
 
01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
um they were a non-profit they could um
 
01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
file more i mean provide more money than
 
01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
just one person so that's one of the
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
illegal actions that i certainly would
 
01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:39.590 align:start position:0%
illegal actions that i certainly would
hope

01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
hope
 
01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
and we may be preventing our attorney
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
general from investigating or for others
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
from investigating and i'm also
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
concerned about and we heard testimony
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
regarding just the attorney general's
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
ability to do their job to get the
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
information that they need to certify
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
that these non-profits and charitable
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
organizations are indeed um you know
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
using the funds for
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
public benefit and whatever else their
 
01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
audits need to find out so i really i
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate so much i think there are
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
significant things in your amendment
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
again i appreciate it but i would like
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
to look at it more and i if i could get
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
anyone to
 
01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:15.759 align:start position:0%
not support the ought to pass with
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
amendment and go for interim study i
 
01:09:19.269 --> 01:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
would certainly appreciate you joining
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um yes so
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
when i am not in the legislature i run a
 
01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
small 501c3 so i wanted to let all of
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
you know that
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
and to say that i really appreciate the
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
and that i'm i'm still not sure how this
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
how the amendment would affect a small
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
501c3 i don't know we heard testimony
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
from the center from nonprofits for
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
non-profits that there might be some
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences and so since i'm
 
01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
not sure about that i'm leaning towards
 
01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
my philosophical commitment to
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
transparency and will be voting against
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative walper
 
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
the objections to this bill that
 
01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
i've heard here
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
have largely to do with political
 
01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
contributions although there are many
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
other 501 c sections
 
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
that don't deal with that but there is
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
that one and there is an entire body of
 
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
our law that deals with those
 
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
organizations that engage in political
 
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.110 align:start position:0%
organizations that engage in political
activity

01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
activity
 
01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:35.990 align:start position:0%
activity
and

01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
and their uh
 
01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.350 align:start position:0%
and their uh
activities

01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
activities
 
01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.790 align:start position:0%
activities
but

01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
if there's ever a place
 
01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
where privacy
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
is important
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.229 align:start position:0%
that's it
because

01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
that's the most divisive part of our
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
society right now
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm supporting this bill and and i
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
just that
 
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
i think we're doing the right thing by
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%

01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
in the last year and a half i have
 
01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:00.390 align:start position:0%
in the last year and a half i have
attended

01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
attended
 
01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.149 align:start position:0%
attended
many

01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
zoo meetings
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
many live streamed meetings
 
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
and nobody nowhere
 
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
can guarantee
 
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent access
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
to the citizens on a public meeting
 
01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
and i'll give you an example
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
i was attending school board meetings in
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
my school district
 
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
and because i couldn't wear a mask i was
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
in a separate room
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
live streamed the meeting
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
and twice the live stream did not work
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
and i had to go
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
stand in a hallway
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
and try to listen
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
to the school board meeting
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
which was very i mean it was not audible
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
at all
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
no citizen should have to do anything
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
like this
 
01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:05.350 align:start position:0%
like this
uh

01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
i also look at it this way
 
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
whether we are
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
or appointed
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
when we take on
 
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
whatever we're doing
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
we know up front
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
that is going to be
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
public meetings
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
and every citizen in the state of new
 
01:15:34.159 --> 01:15:35.350 align:start position:0%
and every citizen in the state of new
hampshire

01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
does not have access
 
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
to electronics i mean there's people
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
like my husband he knows how to turn on
 
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
the computer and get on the internet but
 
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
that's it and i mean there's nothing
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
against him but there's many people like
 
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
him and we just can't take 91a
 
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
and change everything
 
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
and not have public 100 percent public
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.390 align:start position:0%
 
comments

01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%

01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%

01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
forward an amendment
 
01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
number one five four two h which is
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
going around now
 
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
i apologize for it being this late but
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
with the recommendation that the bill
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
and would you want to address your
 
01:17:59.910 --> 01:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
amendment yes i would
 
01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
um i think as we heard testimony um
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
there were lots of people that weren't
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
able primarily from the department of
 
01:18:08.790 --> 01:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
safety weren't able uh to necessarily
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
attend meetings uh particularly during
 
01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:12.070 align:start position:0%
attend meetings uh particularly during
covid

01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
covid
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
and to your point representative andrews
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that this amendment gives
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
us an alternative to the situation you
 
01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
described at the school board
 
01:18:27.189 --> 01:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
if you look at um starting with line 19
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
the requirement has changed to
 
01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
require a
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
physical location
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
for a meeting where members can attend
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
in person
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
while virtually attending access she'll
 
01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
be provided to those who are unable to
 
01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
travel as well as the public and where a
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
minimum of one quarter of the board and
 
01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
commission members shall be required to
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
be at the physical location so it would
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
give the flexibility of anybody
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
conducting a meeting the opportunity to
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
have people both physically present and
 
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
watching a meeting virtually or
 
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
participating virtually
 
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
the other addition
 
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
that's included in this amendment is the
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
inclusion in line eight of the rare
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
disease advisory council of the
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:19:18.149 --> 01:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
and that was primarily because those
 
01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
the members of that council had a lot of
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities and impairments that
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
prevented them from attending physically
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
and we wanted again to have them have
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
the opportunity
 
01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
to present a meeting that offered
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
both choices
 
01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
either going on a regular participating
 
01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
physically or watching it virtually so
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
with the amendment of number 15 42h
 
01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:51.300 align:start position:0%

01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
no joe
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me representative alexander
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chairman um
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
i have a question of the chair and maybe
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
a question of my friend of mine from
 
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
manchester um if the house has already
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
taken position on the specifically the
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
rare disease advisory council
 
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
um not being able to meet remotely would
 
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
that part of the amendment
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
be something that's allowed to be
 
01:20:18.629 --> 01:20:18.639 align:start position:0%
introduced if we've already taken a
 
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
position that they are not allowed to
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
because i remember just just for the
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
committee like we we voted
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
to itl a bill recently that would allow
 
01:20:31.270 --> 01:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
the rare disease
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:35.199 --> 01:20:38.149 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
that's and that's already gone through
 
01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:46.639 align:start position:0%
the house
 
01:20:46.639 --> 01:20:49.350 align:start position:0%
the house
yeah

01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
i guess i don't know the answer to that
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
i guess maybe then you answer the
 
01:20:59.669 --> 01:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
question me just pointing out that the
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
committee has already taken a position
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
um one of these specific points in the
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you thank you
 
01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:10.639 align:start position:0%
represent macbeth yeah so i actually
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
don't know either but it seems to me
 
01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:14.070 align:start position:0%
don't know either but it seems to me
that

01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
the other bill was different it didn't
 
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
have a presiding officer it didn't
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
require a physical
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
place and it didn't require that a
 
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
quarter of the membership be present
 
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
so it is i i would argue that it was
 
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
distinguished enough that it could be
 
01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.149 align:start position:0%
distinguished enough that it could be
considered

01:21:34.149 --> 01:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:21:34.159 --> 01:21:36.470 align:start position:0%
considered
um

01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:39.350 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:40.629 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:40.639 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
i still don't know but i think we're
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
going to move forward with the bill in
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
any event
 
01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
yeah mike as representative sylvia
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i just say that
 
01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh i i think this uh kind of shotgun
 
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
approach to various different exceptions
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
to 91a is a poor policy i think
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
91a should apply
 
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
across all boards and commissions
 
01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:06.709 align:start position:0%
across all boards and commissions
and

01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
i just remind folks that
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
we really
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
want to provide
 
01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
public access
 
01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.470 align:start position:0%
public access
to

01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
physical locations in particular
 
01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
and as part of their regressive
 
01:22:22.239 --> 01:22:23.510 align:start position:0%
and as part of their regressive
grievance

01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
grievance
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
if if
 
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
there was an unfortunate situation
 
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic where folks
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
felt they did not have access to
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
the gentleman in the corner office
 
01:22:35.199 --> 01:22:35.990 align:start position:0%
the gentleman in the corner office
and

01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
chose to visit his home i don't think
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
that's an appropriate thing and i don't
 
01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
think that we should set a policy that
 
01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
would essentially encourage that sort of
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
thing so let's keep public meetings in
 
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
public places
 
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:50.950 align:start position:0%
public places
and

01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
not have uh
 
01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
people's private spaces invaded and i
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
vote against this uh amendment and then
 
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
and then against the bill
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
i am actually going to take a little bit
 
01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
different position i think than
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
represent silvia
 
01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
with a in essence the same conclusion
 
01:23:14.239 --> 01:23:15.430 align:start position:0%
with a in essence the same conclusion
but

01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
i think the amendment makes an
 
01:23:16.719 --> 01:23:17.750 align:start position:0%
i think the amendment makes an
improvement

01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
improvement
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
to the bill i don't have any doubt with
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
that so i think i could support the
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
amendment itself
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
but the underlying bill i can't support
 
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
it sort of goes back to the way
 
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
representative smith approached a
 
01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:31.830 align:start position:0%
representative smith approached a
different

01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
prior bill
 
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:36.790 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment may make it better it does
 
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
make the
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
i really had
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
difficulty in this particular bill and
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
particularly with the testimony that we
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
heard because
 
01:23:56.790 --> 01:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
the testimony i heard
 
01:23:58.709 --> 01:23:58.719 align:start position:0%
uh from
 
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
at least one of the witnesses was
 
01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:02.390 align:start position:0%
at least one of the witnesses was
hey

01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
hey
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
look at the time i'm losing having to
 
01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
drive to concord
 
01:24:09.669 --> 01:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
from hanover and the time i lose driving
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
back when you know i could be seeing
 
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
clients or billing
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
clients for that time i'm losing money
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
coming to concord well i'm not sure
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
that's a good reason
 
01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:22.950 align:start position:0%
that's a good reason
to

01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
do this and
 
01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that if you make the if
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
you make the commitment if somebody
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
approaches you and says we want you to
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
be a member of a board that
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
you accept the responsibility become a
 
01:24:38.229 --> 01:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
member of the board and that means
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
attending the meetings
 
01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
and not to accept your responsibilities
 
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
and then say well no
 
01:24:47.110 --> 01:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
i really don't want to have to do that
 
01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:47.910 align:start position:0%
i really don't want to have to do that
so

01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote against the bill
 
01:24:52.149 --> 01:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
because i think it should be itl but i
 
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
can i can vote for your amendment
 
01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:56.950 align:start position:0%
can i can vote for your amendment
representative

01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:59.830 --> 01:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
yes well i agree that this scattershot
 
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
approaches poor policy but it's even
 
01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:05.350 align:start position:0%
approaches poor policy but it's even
but

01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
obviously the political will and
 
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
consensus doesn't exist
 
01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
this time to come up with a global
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
policy even though what we did with the
 
01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
emergency order
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
generally functioned
 
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
surprisingly surprisingly well
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
considered it was
 
01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:20.470 align:start position:0%
considered it was
considered

01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
it was like devised on short notice
 
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
without a whole lot of
 
01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
field testing for it but um so i think
 
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
but these three three um these
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
three boards have been according to the
 
01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
testimony here have been pretty much
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
shut down for the last two years and
 
01:25:38.229 --> 01:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
they're um
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
they're important especially given um
 
01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
given the pandemic which is still going
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
on um
 
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
so i think uh i think even though it's
 
01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:48.950 align:start position:0%
so i think uh i think even though it's
not

01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
maybe poor policy of even worse policy
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
not to accommodate these boards and
 
01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:55.030 align:start position:0%
not to accommodate these boards and
certainly

01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
no matter what we do even if we go back
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
even when we have all physical locations
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
not all meetings we're at a place that
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
everybody can get to um even though
 
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
they're all
 
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
they're not all held at times that are
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
convenient for for everyone
 
01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.189 align:start position:0%
convenient for for everyone
um

01:26:11.189 --> 01:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:11.199 --> 01:26:11.990 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes they held in places that not
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
everybody feels safe
 
01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
um safe going to so i think that's an
 
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
unavoidable problem and then um
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:24.719 align:start position:0%
you know the debate is ongoing and i
 
01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
think it's um
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
being driven by you know
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
anyway but it's being driven probably by
 
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
a vocal minority but um even
 
01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
but focal minorities uh deserve to be
 
01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
listened to too so anyway i think
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
we should pass this amendment and
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
pass this bill in order to empower these
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
boards to continue functioning because
 
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
they're very essential especially during
 
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
a time of pandemic so i would
 
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
i would say uh i would say so i'll vote
 
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
for the amendment and for the bill even
 
01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:55.430 align:start position:0%
for the amendment and for the bill even
though

01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
though
 
01:26:57.510 --> 01:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
this doesn't solve the
 
01:26:59.430 --> 01:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
bigger problem which will take us
 
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments yep
 
01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i did want to
 
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
just comment on
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
what dr eric martin said who's the head
 
01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
of trauma at
 
01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
dartmouth hitchcock
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
and he had just said that how hard it is
 
01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
to try to get especially the trauma of
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
people together because they do wear
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
many hats they're
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
in the er they're on the floor they're
 
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
just in many different areas and with
 
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
the shortage that we have right now in
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
our medical field that makes me nervous
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
to think that if we pull people out you
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
know that need to be at a meeting
 
01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
because it's mandatory to be there and
 
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
then they are not on the floor they're
 
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
not where they're needed to help
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
people that are ill that that just
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
bothers me so i really the his testimony
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
was the one that got me going that i
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
thought that this was a good idea to be
 
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
able to allow
 
01:27:59.669 --> 01:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
this with people that are wearing many
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
hats and trying to help our community
 
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote for the amendment and
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
for the bill
 
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative woods did
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh i'd just like to re uh like to
 
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
reiterate that in fact having the
 
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
experience on trying to get people to
 
01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
serve on commissions that have high
 
01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:18.709 align:start position:0%
serve on commissions that have high
quality

01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
quality
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
the fact of in person we've had the
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
experience that some people say i'd like
 
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
to serve
 
01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
but if i could do it virtually so
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
one of the trade-offs is we are
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes eliminating so some of the
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
people that would contribute the best
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative mclean
 
01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i i think the
 
01:28:40.629 --> 01:28:40.639 align:start position:0%
amendment is
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
a big improvement but to go back to some
 
01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
of representative wolpers comments on an
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
earlier bill the the problem with the
 
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
amendment is that it it's still a
 
01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
piecemeal approach and i think you know
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
to further draw on representative
 
01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
wolper's comments we're engaged in an
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
iterative approach right now that is
 
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
getting us towards what we think the
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
final solution is going to be and i hope
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
that final solution will be somewhat
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
limited but
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
whatever it ends up being
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
we don't want to have a whole bunch of
 
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
different pieces lying out there in the
 
01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
ether and so um i i i just think that
 
01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
this this is the wrong approach for us
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
to be taking even though the amendment
 
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
does vastly improve the original bill
 
01:29:26.709 --> 01:29:26.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
01:29:31.110 --> 01:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
i just have one very brief comment and
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
that is it is wonderful to hear so many
 
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
of you believe
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
that we should have
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
a consistent universal approach
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
and i look forward to the day when you
 
01:29:48.870 --> 01:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
will in fact support such legislation
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
and you have had opportunities to do
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:58.770 --> 01:29:58.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for your kind remark and
 
01:29:58.780 --> 01:30:02.629 align:start position:0%
thank you for your kind remark and
[Laughter]

01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:02.639 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair i
 
01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
i try to speak the truth thank you
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative simpson
 
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair you all know how i
 
01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
feel about the remote meetings um so
 
01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
just real briefly i wanted to say um
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
how much i appreciated also
 
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
representative walpur's comments at the
 
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
beginning in our first bill
 
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
and just to say that i'll be voting for
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment and the bill
 
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
because i do feel there are some bodies
 
01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
that are feeling that the lack of the
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
ability to solve this is a much more
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
urgent problem than other bodies thanks
 
01:30:43.510 --> 01:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%

okay we're voting on the amendment
 
01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:57.120 align:start position:0%

on that as well
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%

01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman so obviously i
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
voted against the amendment but that
 
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
isn't really why i'm voting against the
 
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
bill or the ought to pass is amended
 
01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
because in my view the the bill has
 
01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:48.629 align:start position:0%
because in my view the the bill has
issues

01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:32:48.639 --> 01:32:50.149 align:start position:0%
issues
that

01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
have been
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
uh bothersome in many cases and this is
 
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
just another
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
and i and i think the reason for that is
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
the desire of the public to participate
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
in one form or another
 
01:33:08.639 --> 01:33:09.750 align:start position:0%
in one form or another
with

01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
the desire of members
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
to participate
 
01:33:14.239 --> 01:33:17.270 align:start position:0%
to participate
remotely

01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
if we allow if we say members can do
 
01:33:22.709 --> 01:33:22.719 align:start position:0%
this that's fine and we can let them do
 
01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
that but when we say you have to allow
 
01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
the public
 
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
now we have an entirely different
 
01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:30.790 align:start position:0%
now we have an entirely different
situation

01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
because allowing the public
 
01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
has the same drawbacks that howling
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
members does in terms of inability to
 
01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:39.270 align:start position:0%
members does in terms of inability to
access

01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
but it also creates the situation where
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
the public
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
could lose access for a short time
 
01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:49.030 align:start position:0%
could lose access for a short time
or

01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
there that the uh and and for this
 
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
particular bill the notice has to be the
 
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
bill would have the meeting would have
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
to be noticed in that form
 
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
including the ways
 
01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:01.669 align:start position:0%
including the ways
of

01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:34:01.679 --> 01:34:03.669 align:start position:0%
of
uh

01:34:03.669 --> 01:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
participating remotely and this bill
 
01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
does not have that
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
so if you don't have if you don't have
 
01:34:13.110 --> 01:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
to notify the public that they can
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
then the public won't be able to
 
01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
and so the language in the bill really
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
any other comments before we vote
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
this is on senate bill 339
 
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
on a motion of ought to pass as amended
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%

and mr clerk do you want to call the
role

01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%

and representative wooper you want to
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
so this is the best shot yet
 
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
and it only has a few
 
01:39:58.870 --> 01:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
things that are bothersome to me i may
 
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:20.830 align:start position:0%
 
can't

01:40:20.830 --> 01:40:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
remember so
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
so part of the problem and perhaps the
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
biggest problem is on line 30 of page
 
01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:34.550 align:start position:0%
biggest problem is on line 30 of page
one

01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
if the public party is notified during
 
01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
the meeting that the public is unable to
 
01:40:39.669 --> 01:40:39.679 align:start position:0%
gain electronic access the meeting shall
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
be adjourned until the public is able to
 
01:40:42.239 --> 01:40:43.510 align:start position:0%
be adjourned until the public is able to
access

01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:40:46.709 --> 01:40:46.719 align:start position:0%
adjournment under this condition
 
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
can be devastating to the boards
 
01:40:52.390 --> 01:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
because they have a hard and a hard
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
enough time already
 
01:40:56.229 --> 01:40:56.239 align:start position:0%
scheduling their meetings
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
so to have to adjourn because of a
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
technical problem where the public can't
 
01:41:01.679 --> 01:41:03.669 align:start position:0%
technical problem where the public can't
access

01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
is a real is a real problem for the
 
01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:08.629 align:start position:0%
is a real is a real problem for the
board

01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
and again let's come back to where i
 
01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
talk about conflating the board and the
 
01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:14.149 align:start position:0%
talk about conflating the board and the
public

01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:41:14.159 --> 01:41:15.189 align:start position:0%
public
so

01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
so that's a real issue for me right here
 
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
that would that alone would be enough
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
for me to vote against this board
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:27.510 --> 01:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
so it's got a lot of good things it
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
requires the physical location and does
 
01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
something to address the quorum
 
01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:32.870 align:start position:0%
something to address the quorum
requirements

01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
and at the moment i am vacant there's
 
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
two other reasons why i don't
 
01:41:38.229 --> 01:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
i oppose this bill but we'll just leave
 
01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:43.189 align:start position:0%
 
comments

01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
represent mclean
 
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um and i agree with
 
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative wolper as i said this is
 
01:41:51.990 --> 01:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
this is an iterative process and this
 
01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
this is i think getting us closer and at
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
least it's not piecemeal but there are a
 
01:41:59.430 --> 01:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
couple of things that i really did have
 
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh concerns about with the bill and one
 
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
of them was with the
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
the what does reasonably practical mean
 
01:42:09.119 --> 01:42:09.910 align:start position:0%
the what does reasonably practical mean
and

01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
when we had the counselor from lebanon
 
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
come in she was saying well i would hope
 
01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:16.639 align:start position:0%
that that would be interpreted in the
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
most restrictive way so if we had
 
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
somebody with knee surgery or something
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
like that and then we had uh someone
 
01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
representing the counties come up to
 
01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:27.030 align:start position:0%
representing the counties come up to
testify

01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
and they said well
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
we're seeing it completely differently
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know if there are
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
schedule conflicts people have busy
 
01:42:36.629 --> 01:42:36.639 align:start position:0%
schedules etc
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
so there's
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
real difference of opinion in terms of
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
what that means but even more important
 
01:42:46.629 --> 01:42:46.639 align:start position:0%
for me is is the fact that the this
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
thing kicks off you know when the
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
legislative body
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
authorizes it to be so and i think that
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
works great as i mentioned in the public
 
01:42:57.510 --> 01:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
hearing for the town of litchfield which
 
01:42:59.830 --> 01:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
is one of the towns i represent because
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
the people of litchfield will have a say
 
01:43:03.990 --> 01:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
we think this works for us
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
but if you're in one of the the 13
 
01:43:08.830 --> 01:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
cities in the state and i'm in
 
01:43:11.109 --> 01:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
manchester essentially i'm not going to
 
01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
have that because the legislative body
 
01:43:16.629 --> 01:43:16.639 align:start position:0%
and the governing body are the same and
 
01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
so the people in manchester really
 
01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
aren't going to have that say
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
um and really it's just going to be
 
01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
the the legislative body says yeah we
 
01:43:28.229 --> 01:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
think this is good and that's because
 
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
they're identical and so i really think
 
01:43:32.709 --> 01:43:32.719 align:start position:0%
you're disenfranchising the the folks in
 
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
the cities that that don't necessarily
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
have a town hall or sb2 former
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
government so these are the reasons i
 
01:43:42.310 --> 01:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
think the bill is getting closer but i
 
01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:50.830 align:start position:0%
 
represent

01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
sylvia thank you mr chairman uh
 
01:43:54.239 --> 01:43:55.510 align:start position:0%
sylvia thank you mr chairman uh
so

01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
01:43:59.109 --> 01:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
representative mclean just hit on uh
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
reminded me of uh one of the
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
really large problems with this uh the
 
01:44:05.669 --> 01:44:05.679 align:start position:0%
legislative body
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
of a political subdivision may vote to
 
01:44:08.159 --> 01:44:09.669 align:start position:0%
of a political subdivision may vote to
authorize

01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
authorize
 
01:44:09.679 --> 01:44:11.669 align:start position:0%
authorize
um

01:44:11.669 --> 01:44:11.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:11.679 --> 01:44:12.870 align:start position:0%
um
that's

01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
something less than clear
 
01:44:17.350 --> 01:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
would it be a vote each time they want
 
01:44:18.629 --> 01:44:18.639 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
some sort of remote uh meeting would it
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
be an annual vote for a
 
01:44:24.239 --> 01:44:26.070 align:start position:0%
be an annual vote for a
town

01:44:26.070 --> 01:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:26.950 align:start position:0%
town
town

01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.390 align:start position:0%
town
meeting

01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
would that vote happen at the town
 
01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
meeting and be applied to the next town
 
01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:34.550 align:start position:0%
meeting and be applied to the next town
meeting

01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
this is uh
 
01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
really unclear
 
01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:39.030 align:start position:0%
really unclear
and

01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
that's certainly plenty of reason to
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
oppose this
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:58.149 --> 01:44:58.159 align:start position:0%
we just had the hearing on this bill
 
01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
yesterday so none of us have much time
 
01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:00.870 align:start position:0%
yesterday so none of us have much time
to

01:45:00.870 --> 01:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
think about it but it um
 
01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
it is a step to a non wait something
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
other than a piecemeal solution and
 
01:45:08.159 --> 01:45:09.590 align:start position:0%
other than a piecemeal solution and
actually

01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:45:12.070 --> 01:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
appears the uh coalition
 
01:45:14.229 --> 01:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
in favor of in the senate was fair was
 
01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh fairly broad so there are some fairly
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
conservative senators bucking um
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
bucking the other members of the party
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't uh happens more often
 
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
in the senate than the house but doesn't
 
01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
happen too often so it's a positive
 
01:45:30.870 --> 01:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
so it's positive positive trend and also
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh
 
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
the people and remote meetings when we
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
had the emergency order during the
 
01:45:37.590 --> 01:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic um
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
participation in meetings um if anything
 
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
i think it maybe slightly went up at
 
01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
least in my community in town meetings
 
01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639 align:start position:0%
this was
 
01:45:46.149 --> 01:45:46.159 align:start position:0%
something that you know
 
01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
the people actually
 
01:45:49.189 --> 01:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
well they certainly were not actively
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
opposed to it it seemed to be quite
 
01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
quite popular and of course you know not
 
01:45:52.639 --> 01:45:54.149 align:start position:0%
quite popular and of course you know not
everybody's

01:45:54.149 --> 01:45:54.159 align:start position:0%
everybody's
 
01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
you know not everybody's computer
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
equipment works
 
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
but that's true even for in-person
 
01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
meetings not everybody can get to every
 
01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
meeting not every meeting is at a time
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's convenient for everyone or in a
 
01:46:06.629 --> 01:46:06.639 align:start position:0%
place that
 
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
everyone can easily easily access so i
 
01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:11.590 align:start position:0%
everyone can easily easily access so i
think

01:46:11.590 --> 01:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
i mean there certainly are details in
 
01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
this bill um that probably could be
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
looked at but i think rejecting it
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
i i think this is a uh
 
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
i think this is like a very huge step
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
forward so like um it would be it would
 
01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
be a shame if something like this didn't
 
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
pass uh
 
01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
fairly soon hopefully
 
01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
so i would i would i would be opposed to
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
itling it right off the bat like this
 
01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:37.990 align:start position:0%
itling it right off the bat like this
thanks

01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.030 align:start position:0%

01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you there
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
there are many people who for one reason
 
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
or another uh can't get involved in
 
01:46:51.189 --> 01:46:51.199 align:start position:0%
public service
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
um i myself had a job with a consulting
 
01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:56.790 align:start position:0%
um i myself had a job with a consulting
firm

01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
firm
 
01:46:58.870 --> 01:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
it took me
 
01:47:01.030 --> 01:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
60 hours a week
 
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
in a typical week and really left almost
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
no room
 
01:47:07.270 --> 01:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
to do any of the kind of public service
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
work that i really would have liked to
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
have done
 
01:47:12.629 --> 01:47:12.639 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of people who are not
 
01:47:12.639 --> 01:47:13.990 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of people who are not
retired

01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
retired
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
are in that situation there are things
 
01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
that people would like to do
 
01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
to help to become more involved in their
 
01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
community to become more involved in
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
decision making in their communities
 
01:47:27.430 --> 01:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
i see bills like this as a way to do
 
01:47:29.590 --> 01:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
that and and i think
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
one of the good things that came out of
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
kovit if there if there were any good
 
01:47:34.070 --> 01:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
things at all
 
01:47:35.590 --> 01:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
was the fact that we all had a learning
 
01:47:37.750 --> 01:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
experience around the fact that while
 
01:47:39.990 --> 01:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
there are bugs with the technology
 
01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.350 align:start position:0%
there are bugs with the technology
periodically

01:47:41.350 --> 01:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
periodically
 
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
um overall it did allow more people to
 
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
participate in the process
 
01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:48.229 align:start position:0%
participate in the process
um

01:47:48.229 --> 01:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
and uh and a lot of people really
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
welcome that process and i think that
 
01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people right now
 
01:47:55.750 --> 01:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh who are missing it
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh in my community in portsmouth it's
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
always a little bit of a struggle to
 
01:48:01.590 --> 01:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
find as many volunteers as we need
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
especially qualified volunteers for
 
01:48:06.149 --> 01:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
people to serve on our various boards
 
01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
and commissions
 
01:48:09.990 --> 01:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
this is something we can do to make it
 
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.270 align:start position:0%
this is something we can do to make it
easier

01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
easier
 
01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
and the other thing that i'd like to
 
01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:14.639 align:start position:0%
remind folks of too is
 
01:48:16.629 --> 01:48:16.639 align:start position:0%
this was a huge benefit for people who
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
have mobility issues so not just young
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
people who are working
 
01:48:23.109 --> 01:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
but people for one reason or another who
 
01:48:24.709 --> 01:48:24.719 align:start position:0%
have problems getting up some of the
 
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%
stairs of our public buildings who have
 
01:48:26.719 --> 01:48:28.310 align:start position:0%
stairs of our public buildings who have
problems

01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
problems
 
01:48:31.109 --> 01:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
getting into some of those rooms
 
01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
problems with just transportation back
 
01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
and forth and and so effectively when
 
01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
we're not doing things like this i think
 
01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we have to
 
01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:40.390 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we have to
realize

01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
realize
 
01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
is that we are shutting people out of
 
01:48:43.590 --> 01:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
and these people are citizens too and
 
01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
this is something that we need to keep
 
01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
in mind
 
01:48:48.639 --> 01:48:50.470 align:start position:0%
in mind
thanks

01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:48:51.750 --> 01:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
yes senator page representative page
 
01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
thanks for the promotion thank you mr
 
01:48:57.040 --> 01:48:59.189 align:start position:0%
thanks for the promotion thank you mr
chair

01:48:59.189 --> 01:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
um i'm new so
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
this is my freshman
 
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
term as a rep but
 
01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
i've yet to see and i'm respectful to
 
01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:08.719 align:start position:0%
the piecemeal arguments about perhaps
 
01:49:08.719 --> 01:49:09.669 align:start position:0%
the piecemeal arguments about perhaps
the

01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:09.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
cutting away exclusions swallows up the
 
01:49:11.679 --> 01:49:12.790 align:start position:0%
cutting away exclusions swallows up the
rule

01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
rule
 
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
but we seem to identify that this is not
 
01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:15.990 align:start position:0%
but we seem to identify that this is not
that

01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.430 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
i've yet in my short tenure here i've
 
01:49:22.229 --> 01:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
yet to see a perfect bill
 
01:49:24.149 --> 01:49:24.159 align:start position:0%
but i've seen a lot of pretty darn good
 
01:49:24.159 --> 01:49:25.270 align:start position:0%
but i've seen a lot of pretty darn good
bills

01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:49:27.589 --> 01:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
and i think this is one of those
 
01:49:30.229 --> 01:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
i hear from folks back in exeter where
 
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
i'm from
 
01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
elected officials and the public
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
begging for ways to keep this going
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
because they found
 
01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
that they were able to access meetings
 
01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
so under the pretty darn good bill
 
01:49:46.149 --> 01:49:46.159 align:start position:0%
standard i think it passes
 
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:49.830 --> 01:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you just to comment
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
i agree i think this is the best we have
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
so far and i just want to say on a
 
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
personal basis i'm involved with a lot
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
of childhood cancer survivorship
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
studies and i was able to do a lot of
 
01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
access and be involved in a lot of
 
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
things that were across country that i
 
01:50:15.030 --> 01:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
never would have been able to afford to
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
fly out to california to be part of a
 
01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
group and on a
 
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
a panel discussion so i think this is
 
01:50:25.270 --> 01:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
great yes we're all going to have issues
 
01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
but all in all this is the best way i
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
see to allow the public to have the
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
access for all of the reasons that david
 
01:50:33.589 --> 01:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
pointed out
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
and my own experience thank you thank
 
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:38.960 align:start position:0%

chair i just want to talk about my own
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
experience and
 
01:50:46.470 --> 01:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
my volunteer work i serve on the
 
01:50:49.109 --> 01:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
board of the rotten ham nutritions meals
 
01:50:51.030 --> 01:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
on wheels program and we've been meeting
 
01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
virtually and it's been really really
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
great to be able to do that i also serve
 
01:50:57.589 --> 01:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
on the rockingham county executive
 
01:50:59.510 --> 01:50:59.520 align:start position:0%

01:51:12.870 --> 01:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to comment a lot of people
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
have talked this morning about
 
01:51:19.510 --> 01:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
doing this as a piecemeal kind of
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
legislation and i would agree that we've
 
01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
done that and and i also would agree
 
01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
with those that represented this as
 
01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
probably the best effort that we've had
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
this far but i guess when i think about
 
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
doing something this innovative and for
 
01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:36.310 align:start position:0%
doing something this innovative and for
us

01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:37.510 align:start position:0%
 
video

01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
video
 
01:51:40.390 --> 01:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
access to public public meetings is a
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
new thing and it's happened as a result
 
01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
of covid i don't think we can expect to
 
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
have it perfect i think we need to start
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
someplace and take the best of what we
 
01:51:53.350 --> 01:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
have and to build on it from there and
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
and to decide that perhaps it's not
 
01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
exactly what we want but we know that
 
01:51:59.589 --> 01:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
it's going to get us to where we want to
 
01:51:59.599 --> 01:52:00.550 align:start position:0%
it's going to get us to where we want to
go

01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
and then if i just might add from a
 
01:52:04.229 --> 01:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
personal perspective
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
um those of you obviously you know that
 
01:52:08.790 --> 01:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
i'm in a chair and i was late this
 
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
morning and i was late this morning
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
because i could not get my vn door to
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
close it's automatic and every once in a
 
01:52:18.790 --> 01:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
while it has a mind of its own and it
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
just keeps going back and forth
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
i just say the story because if i had
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
had public access i would have been able
 
01:52:26.790 --> 01:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
to turn around go back in the house
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
turned on my computer and had access to
 
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
this meeting not be stressed not be
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
frazzled because i knew i was going to
 
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
be late and i knew that i had an
 
01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to bring forward so i think it
 
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
provides opportunities that
 
01:52:42.629 --> 01:52:42.639 align:start position:0%
we don't always think about and i think
 
01:52:44.790 --> 01:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's a place to start and i think it's
 
01:52:46.229 --> 01:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
very important that we get started
 
01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
comments representative wolper are you
 
01:52:54.870 --> 01:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
waiting i'm waiting yes yeah
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
representative oregon um
 
01:52:59.109 --> 01:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
and yes what happened to
 
01:53:01.109 --> 01:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
reverend langley applies even to people
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
who are what they call temporary
 
01:53:05.669 --> 01:53:05.679 align:start position:0%
able-bodied like myself and
 
01:53:07.350 --> 01:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
brethren mckinney were
 
01:53:09.510 --> 01:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
late for meeting last week because my my
 
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
tire blew you know so i
 
01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not in a i'm not in a wheelchair i
 
01:53:15.750 --> 01:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
get around pretty well i get around very
 
01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
well by myself but still like
 
01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:19.430 align:start position:0%
well by myself but still like
something

01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
something happened and thank you very
 
01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
much everybody cooper very much to
 
01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
accommodate us and we're extremely
 
01:53:26.709 --> 01:53:26.719 align:start position:0%
grateful but that's uh
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
those type of things um those type of
 
01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:29.430 align:start position:0%
those type of things um those type of
things

01:53:29.430 --> 01:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:53:31.189 --> 01:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
happened even before we had virtual
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
meetings you know that's the fact of
 
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
life that not everybody
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know things happen to make it hard
 
01:53:37.510 --> 01:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
for people to get to meetings um so i
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
think the objections raised about
 
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
computer problems are in many cases the
 
01:53:43.109 --> 01:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
same thing as you know sometimes
 
01:53:44.709 --> 01:53:44.719 align:start position:0%
people's computers don't work sometimes
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
people's tires blow and um
 
01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:48.070 align:start position:0%
people's tires blow and um
so

01:53:48.070 --> 01:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:50.470 --> 01:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
i think um on balance having
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
hybrid meetings um makes it easier for
 
01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
people to uh makes it easier for members
 
01:53:56.149 --> 01:53:56.159 align:start position:0%
of the public and for members of the
 
01:53:58.470 --> 01:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
bodies to attend so i think this is a
 
01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
this is a good bill it might
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
it might indeed need a amendment to
 
01:54:05.430 --> 01:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
change adjourned to recessed but um i
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
say this is an excellent bill and i
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
think certainly
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
itlling it is like a premature and not a
 
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:19.030 --> 01:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative wolfer
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so this
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
conversation that we've just had
 
01:54:26.159 --> 01:54:27.910 align:start position:0%
conversation that we've just had
underscores

01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
underscores
 
01:54:29.669 --> 01:54:29.679 align:start position:0%
something that i've said over and over
 
01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
and i said it at the beginning of the
 
01:54:32.629 --> 01:54:32.639 align:start position:0%
discussion of this bill
 
01:54:34.950 --> 01:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
that we conflate
 
01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:35.910 align:start position:0%
that we conflate
the

01:54:35.910 --> 01:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
operation of our 91a
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
and public access
 
01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:47.669 --> 01:54:47.679 align:start position:0%
it does not say
 
01:54:49.510 --> 01:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
anything about how that's achieved
 
01:54:51.189 --> 01:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't written
 
01:54:53.430 --> 01:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
in the age of hybrid meetings
 
01:54:56.470 --> 01:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
but there is no reason why
 
01:55:00.629 --> 01:55:00.639 align:start position:0%
the members cannot participate
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
remotely and the public not have
 
01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
electronic access
 
01:55:09.589 --> 01:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
that there is no reason why that
 
01:55:13.750 --> 01:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
situation has to can can't occur
 
01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
at the same time there's no reason why
 
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
the public can't have
 
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
electronic access
 
01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
right now just like they have access to
 
01:55:26.550 --> 01:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
this meeting that we're in
 
01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
they have no ability to speak
 
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
but they can observe
 
01:55:35.589 --> 01:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
and they can follow what's going on
 
01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
and hear and and they can watch their
 
01:55:39.669 --> 01:55:39.679 align:start position:0%
public servants and actions which is the
 
01:55:42.870 --> 01:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
essence of why we have public meetings
 
01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
so that situation the access for the
 
01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:47.589 align:start position:0%
so that situation the access for the
public

01:55:47.589 --> 01:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
is not a concern
 
01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
of 91a
 
01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:54.709 align:start position:0%
of 91a
unless

01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
unless
 
01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
you go to a
 
01:56:00.629 --> 01:56:00.639 align:start position:0%
pretty much totally remote meeting
 
01:56:02.629 --> 01:56:02.639 align:start position:0%
and that's what any but it creates a lot
 
01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
of problems when you write the bills
 
01:56:08.229 --> 01:56:08.239 align:start position:0%
because to allow large numbers of people
 
01:56:08.239 --> 01:56:10.149 align:start position:0%
because to allow large numbers of people
access

01:56:10.149 --> 01:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:56:13.350 --> 01:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
and to allow them and particularly
 
01:56:16.629 --> 01:56:16.639 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to participate by asking
 
01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
questions or making comments
 
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
is a much more difficult
 
01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:23.510 align:start position:0%
is a much more difficult
task

01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
task
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
than allowing them to observe and to
 
01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:29.030 align:start position:0%
than allowing them to observe and to
listen

01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:30.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
there you have that
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
until we sort that out and i personally
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
would prefer if we just wrote a bill
 
01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
didn't even talk to the public
 
01:56:40.870 --> 01:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
it just said you can have remote
 
01:56:43.270 --> 01:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
meetings as long as you go a number of
 
01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
people when you notice it and you have a
 
01:56:46.790 --> 01:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
regular public meeting but some people
 
01:56:48.550 --> 01:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
can participate remotely i'd be a lot
 
01:56:50.310 --> 01:56:50.320 align:start position:0%
happier to see that
 
01:56:53.350 --> 01:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
because it would be easier to do
 
01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
for everybody and when we start saying
 
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
things like you have to allow the public
 
01:56:59.830 --> 01:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
to participate we run into
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
money miller issues with broadband and
 
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
cost and ability of rsa 2088 on
 
01:57:11.109 --> 01:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates and things like that
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
so we're close
 
01:57:14.950 --> 01:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
to being able to do it for the boards
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm frankly very hopeful that we are
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
we have this done within the next year
 
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
but this bill was not that
 
01:57:25.669 --> 01:57:25.679 align:start position:0%
and the objections that i i believe i
 
01:57:27.189 --> 01:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
believe are valid and strong enough to
 
01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
vote against it
 
01:57:30.390 --> 01:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:31.830 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

01:57:31.830 --> 01:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:57:33.189 --> 01:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
representative macbeth
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
so i just have a question if this bill
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
is close are you is interim studies
 
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
something that you would
 
01:57:40.470 --> 01:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
if they're just a few changes would you
 
01:57:42.629 --> 01:57:42.639 align:start position:0%
consider doing that so that we could
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
work on it and get it done i mean
 
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
because i do sense this urgency as well
 
01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:47.270 align:start position:0%
because i do sense this urgency as well
amongst

01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
amongst
 
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
having having already committed to serve
 
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
on one interim study committee from this
 
01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
committee this year
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
i mean i would like to say yes to that
 
01:58:16.470 --> 01:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:18.070 --> 01:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
so is it your understanding though that
 
01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
if you were to support interim study
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
that you would have to be a member of
 
01:58:23.350 --> 01:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
that study committee
 
01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that i would not
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
support interim study any other way yes
 
01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
what if we had all the meetings
 
01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:50.390 align:start position:0%
what if we had all the meetings
virtually

01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:51.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
okay

recommendation of interim study i think
 
02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
if we just
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
took 15 minutes would be a good idea
 
02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:35.510 align:start position:0%
took 15 minutes would be a good idea
and

02:01:35.510 --> 02:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:01:37.510 --> 02:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
come back here at quarter past so we can
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:45.430 --> 02:01:45.440 align:start position:0%

02:17:02.469 --> 02:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
and would you like to address your
 
02:17:05.190 --> 02:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
motion um sure mr chair um so this bill
 
02:17:06.629 --> 02:17:06.639 align:start position:0%
um would ensure that charities are
 
02:17:09.190 --> 02:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
protected from burdensome or onerous
 
02:17:10.629 --> 02:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
filing requirements that are not
 
02:17:12.549 --> 02:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
authorized under existing state or
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
federal law so currently um some some
 
02:17:17.349 --> 02:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations are being
 
02:17:20.389 --> 02:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
required to file multiple duplicative um
 
02:17:22.790 --> 02:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
insensitive reports with local officials
 
02:17:24.790 --> 02:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
and it's often exceeding current federal
 
02:17:26.549 --> 02:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
and state requirements so
 
02:17:28.709 --> 02:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
this job this bill does a good job
 
02:17:30.230 --> 02:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
protecting the integrity of non-profits
 
02:17:32.950 --> 02:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire but safeguard but put
 
02:17:35.030 --> 02:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
safeguards in place that will provide
 
02:17:36.150 --> 02:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate balance between
 
02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:37.429 align:start position:0%
appropriate balance between
accountability

02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
02:17:39.990 --> 02:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
and reliability for all um charitable
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
organizations so i really hope that the
 
02:17:45.190 --> 02:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
committee would agree with me thank you
 
02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:50.469 align:start position:0%
committee would agree with me thank you

so
 
02:19:52.950 --> 02:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
the the point of this amendment what
 
02:19:55.030 --> 02:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
drove this amendment is the roman three
 
02:19:57.910 --> 02:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
that in romans 3 that you see
 
02:19:59.910 --> 02:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
are bolded at the bottom of it and it
 
02:20:01.590 --> 02:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
says to the insurance department which
 
02:20:03.030 --> 02:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
is what what the bill is about in
 
02:20:04.309 --> 02:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
connection with ongoing criminal
 
02:20:07.990 --> 02:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:11.110 --> 02:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
related to insurance fraud
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:18.630 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:20:18.630 --> 02:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:22.710 --> 02:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:24.870 --> 02:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's not isn't it no
 
02:20:27.190 --> 02:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
no this is the same as the original bill
 
02:20:28.830 --> 02:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
miss chairman
 
02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
yes uh this uh amendment doesn't seem to
 
02:20:34.389 --> 02:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
do what was discussed uh
 
02:20:35.910 --> 02:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
during our caucus
 
02:20:38.710 --> 02:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh is it possible does is there any
 
02:20:40.070 --> 02:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
deadline on this
 
02:20:41.830 --> 02:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
bill that is pressing
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
we do not have a pressing deadline
 
02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:47.349 align:start position:0%
we do not have a pressing deadline
i'm

02:20:47.349 --> 02:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
02:20:49.750 --> 02:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with the original bill as
 
02:20:52.630 --> 02:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
it was uh submitted here and
 
02:20:54.389 --> 02:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
if possible
 
02:20:56.230 --> 02:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
i would rather take this up in the
 
02:21:02.309 --> 02:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:02.319 --> 02:21:07.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:21:07.590 --> 02:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:07.600 --> 02:21:09.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:21:09.030 --> 02:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
yeah go go ahead representative open so
 
02:21:13.429 --> 02:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
just so everyone knows what's going on
 
02:21:13.439 --> 02:21:14.550 align:start position:0%
just so everyone knows what's going on
here

02:21:14.550 --> 02:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:21:17.590 --> 02:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
the intent of this amendment was and
 
02:21:17.600 --> 02:21:19.030 align:start position:0%
the intent of this amendment was and
remains

02:21:19.030 --> 02:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
remains
 
02:21:21.270 --> 02:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
to narrow
 
02:21:25.030 --> 02:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:28.309 --> 02:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
and the department actually said
 
02:21:30.870 --> 02:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
that they wanted information about the
 
02:21:35.190 --> 02:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
nature and time of calls
 
02:21:37.750 --> 02:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
and that's what we wanted i intended and
 
02:21:40.389 --> 02:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
what i sent to ols to add into that
 
02:21:42.790 --> 02:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
roman numeral three
 
02:21:45.750 --> 02:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
in the process of doing that
 
02:21:51.190 --> 02:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
well they didn't do it they didn't do
 
02:21:55.429 --> 02:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
any of it oh they did
 
02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
did they
 
02:21:58.230 --> 02:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
where's the one two three yeah okay on
 
02:22:03.270 --> 02:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:05.590 --> 02:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
on line six
 
02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
the current built law says rsa 91a
 
02:22:11.429 --> 02:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
regardless of the use of sus information
 
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
under paragraphs one or two
 
02:22:18.870 --> 02:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
or n2 yeah it must be one or two one two
 
02:22:21.750 --> 02:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
since we're adding three
 
02:22:25.349 --> 02:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:28.870 --> 02:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:31.429 --> 02:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
they did i guess so it says or three
 
02:22:31.439 --> 02:22:32.389 align:start position:0%
they did i guess so it says or three
right

02:22:32.389 --> 02:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:22:34.950 --> 02:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
so that part of it is good but but they
 
02:22:38.309 --> 02:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
did not include the narrowing of roman
 
02:22:39.990 --> 02:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
three under
 
02:22:42.710 --> 02:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:44.309 --> 02:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
and that's what the problem my problem
 
02:22:45.910 --> 02:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
with this is that
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
i think this language is too broad right
 
02:22:49.510 --> 02:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
now and especially since we're dealing
 
02:22:52.150 --> 02:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
with e-911 data
 
02:22:54.389 --> 02:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
it needs to be as narrow and
 
02:22:58.230 --> 02:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:00.309 --> 02:23:00.319 align:start position:0%
well i think we can um
 
02:23:03.349 --> 02:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
we we have some alt since this isn't
 
02:23:05.110 --> 02:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
what was intended
 
02:23:07.429 --> 02:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
unless somebody ultimately makes an
 
02:23:10.630 --> 02:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
alternative recommendation we could
 
02:23:12.950 --> 02:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
we could vote down
 
02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:14.389 align:start position:0%
we could vote down
your

02:23:14.389 --> 02:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh your motion today or you could
 
02:23:18.630 --> 02:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
withdraw your motion today
 
02:23:22.790 --> 02:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
and we could recess to a later date
 
02:23:25.030 --> 02:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
for executive session
 
02:23:28.389 --> 02:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
the other possibility is if there
 
02:23:30.389 --> 02:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
is an alternative motion one of the
 
02:23:33.190 --> 02:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
things that we could do is potentially
 
02:23:34.389 --> 02:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
have a
 
02:23:36.550 --> 02:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
been expedient to legislate or ought to
 
02:23:37.750 --> 02:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
pass if somebody felt that was
 
02:23:39.349 --> 02:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate or
 
02:23:41.830 --> 02:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
another motion of
 
02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
02:23:44.830 --> 02:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
which might be a
 
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
possibility i know that there were
 
02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
or have been a number of concerns
 
02:23:49.840 --> 02:23:51.190 align:start position:0%
or have been a number of concerns
expressed

02:23:51.190 --> 02:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
expressed
 
02:23:52.870 --> 02:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
which is what gave rise to your
 
02:23:54.710 --> 02:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
amendment to begin with representative
 
02:23:57.910 --> 02:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
alexander thank you mr chair um
 
02:24:00.950 --> 02:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
in in deferring with my friend i i want
 
02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
to throw it out there would a floor
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
amendment be okay yeah i'll agree on
 
02:24:06.230 --> 02:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
that and we vote ought to pass and offer
 
02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
a floor amendment and we
 
02:24:10.710 --> 02:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
do it on a bipartisan if i were to uh
 
02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:19.110 --> 02:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
that's right so so
 
02:24:23.429 --> 02:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
the what what's existing up on line six
 
02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
needs to happen
 
02:24:25.439 --> 02:24:26.870 align:start position:0%
needs to happen
otherwise

02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
the roman three won't have any real
 
02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:29.990 align:start position:0%
the roman three won't have any real
force

02:24:29.990 --> 02:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
force
 
02:24:31.910 --> 02:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
so we could adopt this amendment the way
 
02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:24:35.910 --> 02:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
and i can introduce a four amendment
 
02:24:39.990 --> 02:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:41.190 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:24:41.190 --> 02:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:24:43.510 --> 02:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative alexander alluded if we
 
02:24:46.070 --> 02:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
can do that in some kind of bipartisan
 
02:24:47.990 --> 02:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
manner that is we say
 
02:24:50.150 --> 02:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
myself and maybe the senior member or a
 
02:24:52.469 --> 02:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
couple of democrats sponsor the
 
02:24:53.910 --> 02:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
floor amendment
 
02:24:56.309 --> 02:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
we can talk to it in that way on the
 
02:24:56.319 --> 02:24:57.190 align:start position:0%
we can talk to it in that way on the
floor

02:24:57.190 --> 02:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
floor
 
02:25:01.830 --> 02:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:03.750 --> 02:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
rep representative woods uh
 
02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
another possibility we health and human
 
02:25:07.990 --> 02:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
services met on tuesday we stayed till
 
02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock
 
02:25:11.349 --> 02:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
we had several amendments and ols
 
02:25:14.070 --> 02:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
actually stayed until nine o'clock with
 
02:25:15.990 --> 02:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
just that in mind
 
02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh would there be a possibility that we
 
02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
could recess this and have the
 
02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:22.469 align:start position:0%
could recess this and have the
representative

02:25:22.469 --> 02:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
see if ols uh because it seemed like it
 
02:25:27.670 --> 02:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
would be a fairly quick redo and then do
 
02:25:30.150 --> 02:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
this at the end of this session here
 
02:25:32.309 --> 02:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
if if they're available uh they were
 
02:25:36.389 --> 02:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:39.830 --> 02:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i i would just um i would like it
 
02:25:41.270 --> 02:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
to come out of the committee the way
 
02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
instead of using the time in the house
 
02:25:43.439 --> 02:25:44.469 align:start position:0%
instead of using the time in the house
session

02:25:44.469 --> 02:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:25:46.710 --> 02:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
it would be i would prefer us either
 
02:25:48.389 --> 02:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
wait to have it done immediately today
 
02:25:50.389 --> 02:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
because i know some of us may have plans
 
02:25:52.070 --> 02:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
else you know until at nine o'clock i'm
 
02:25:54.230 --> 02:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
sorry i can't stay that late but or if
 
02:25:55.429 --> 02:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
there's since there's no time why don't
 
02:25:56.950 --> 02:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
we just wait until our next executive
 
02:25:56.960 --> 02:25:58.790 align:start position:0%
we just wait until our next executive
session

02:25:58.790 --> 02:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:26:01.030 --> 02:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
well we we were hoping to have this
 
02:26:03.190 --> 02:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
would be this is our last bill so we
 
02:26:04.389 --> 02:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
were hoping to have the executive
 
02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
session done today if we could
 
02:26:08.469 --> 02:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:14.230 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:26:14.230 --> 02:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:26:15.590 --> 02:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
02:26:17.830 --> 02:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
it is not uncommon
 
02:26:20.150 --> 02:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
that in
 
02:26:23.190 --> 02:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
using belt and suspenders that after a
 
02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:25.190 align:start position:0%
using belt and suspenders that after a
committee

02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:26:26.630 --> 02:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
considers a bill
 
02:26:30.070 --> 02:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
they realize that there's an additional
 
02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
change that has to be made
 
02:26:35.910 --> 02:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think it has to take up a lot of
 
02:26:39.429 --> 02:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
time on the floor and i would
 
02:26:39.439 --> 02:26:40.710 align:start position:0%
time on the floor and i would
if

02:26:40.710 --> 02:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:26:42.389 --> 02:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
my hand was up
 
02:26:44.950 --> 02:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
earlier to suggest that what we do is we
 
02:26:47.590 --> 02:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
vote on on this amendment
 
02:26:49.590 --> 02:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
we vote on the bill
 
02:26:52.950 --> 02:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
and we agree
 
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
with that taking a vote
 
02:26:58.070 --> 02:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
on a floor amendment
 
02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
that can come in as the committee floor
 
02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:04.070 align:start position:0%
that can come in as the committee floor
amendment

02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:06.870 --> 02:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
and then that makes it possible
 
02:27:09.349 --> 02:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
for us to finish our responsibilities
 
02:27:11.830 --> 02:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
here and it makes it possible
 
02:27:14.630 --> 02:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
for us to finish our response we have a
 
02:27:17.590 --> 02:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
lot of time for this because
 
02:27:20.950 --> 02:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
next thursday's session will only be the
 
02:27:22.950 --> 02:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
the first committee bills
 
02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
so it won't be till may 4th i guess
 
02:27:29.110 --> 02:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
that it will come up but um i think
 
02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
02:27:32.150 --> 02:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
generally that's the most efficient way
 
02:27:36.070 --> 02:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:41.110 --> 02:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:42.950 --> 02:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
02:27:45.349 --> 02:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
the issue is with regard to the
 
02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
amendment is that there was information
 
02:27:50.550 --> 02:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
requested but
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
the way the current language is written
 
02:27:54.630 --> 02:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
is just as representative wilbur said
 
02:27:56.710 --> 02:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
it's just too broad give it too much
 
02:27:58.389 --> 02:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
authority and it needed to be narrowed
 
02:27:58.399 --> 02:27:59.510 align:start position:0%
authority and it needed to be narrowed
down

02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
down
 
02:28:01.750 --> 02:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
because basically it gives them
 
02:28:03.990 --> 02:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
if you read it it gives them access to
 
02:28:06.950 --> 02:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
all of the information in 9-1-1 and when
 
02:28:09.270 --> 02:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
specifically what they said is we only
 
02:28:11.349 --> 02:28:11.359 align:start position:0%
want to know the nature and time of
 
02:28:13.670 --> 02:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
calls and it should be limited just to
 
02:28:15.590 --> 02:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
the nature and time of calls that they
 
02:28:15.600 --> 02:28:16.790 align:start position:0%
the nature and time of calls that they
have

02:28:16.790 --> 02:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:17.750 align:start position:0%
have
and

02:28:17.750 --> 02:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:28:20.070 --> 02:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
so i think that would be what was
 
02:28:21.990 --> 02:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
intended in the amendment and what we
 
02:28:23.670 --> 02:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
would have to do as a floor amendment if
 
02:28:26.950 --> 02:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
we all agree to that
 
02:28:29.590 --> 02:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
so if i mean and i would be happy to um
 
02:28:33.270 --> 02:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
have my name on the floor amendment um
 
02:28:35.830 --> 02:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
with the clerk if that's the appropriate
 
02:28:37.110 --> 02:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
way to do it
 
02:28:38.790 --> 02:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
when okay
 
02:28:40.710 --> 02:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
so would you want to
 
02:28:42.550 --> 02:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:28:44.309 --> 02:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so
 
02:28:46.469 --> 02:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
um i can forward all this to you so you
 
02:28:51.190 --> 02:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:53.750 --> 02:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
but the what what is lacking out of this
 
02:28:56.950 --> 02:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
is in roman 3 my roman 3 says
 
02:28:59.349 --> 02:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
to the insurance department
 
02:29:02.870 --> 02:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
information on the nature and time of
 
02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:04.550 align:start position:0%
information on the nature and time of
calls

02:29:04.550 --> 02:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
calls
 
02:29:07.349 --> 02:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
solely for the purpose of conducting an
 
02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
ongoing criminal investigation related
 
02:29:11.270 --> 02:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
to insurance fraud or other
 
02:29:14.070 --> 02:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
insurance-related criminal activity
 
02:29:15.830 --> 02:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
the insurance department shall not
 
02:29:19.270 --> 02:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
release such shared data under rsa 91a
 
02:29:21.510 --> 02:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
this is virtually the same language
 
02:29:23.110 --> 02:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
that's in roman
 
02:29:25.590 --> 02:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
two for the department of environmental
 
02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:26.870 align:start position:0%
two for the department of environmental
services

02:29:26.870 --> 02:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:29:26.880 --> 02:29:28.070 align:start position:0%
services
just

02:29:28.070 --> 02:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:29:29.910 --> 02:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored to the insurance
 
02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:33.270 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored to the insurance
department

02:29:33.270 --> 02:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:34.710 --> 02:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
okay and that was what that would be
 
02:29:36.150 --> 02:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
what would be included in the floor
 
02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that would be the fourth
 
02:29:39.670 --> 02:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
amendment to replace mormon 3 with that
 
02:29:39.680 --> 02:29:41.750 align:start position:0%
amendment to replace mormon 3 with that
language

02:29:41.750 --> 02:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:43.830 align:start position:0%
language
representative

02:29:43.830 --> 02:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:29:45.910 --> 02:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
mr chant thank you just a quick question
 
02:29:48.469 --> 02:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
on the information i know you mentioned
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
the time and the nature of the incident
 
02:29:52.870 --> 02:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
would that also
 
02:29:54.870 --> 02:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
include the caller's information because
 
02:29:55.830 --> 02:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
if they're doing a criminal
 
02:29:58.070 --> 02:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
investigation into
 
02:30:00.790 --> 02:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
fraud insurance fraud wouldn't they want
 
02:30:03.590 --> 02:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
to speak with the caller who could be a
 
02:30:03.600 --> 02:30:05.990 align:start position:0%
to speak with the caller who could be a
witness

02:30:05.990 --> 02:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:06.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:30:06.870 --> 02:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
it occurs to me
 
02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:10.870 align:start position:0%
it occurs to me
so

02:30:10.870 --> 02:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:30:11.730 --> 02:30:11.740 align:start position:0%
what they mean
 
02:30:11.740 --> 02:30:13.030 align:start position:0%
what they mean
[Music]

02:30:13.030 --> 02:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:30:15.270 --> 02:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
when they say the nature
 
02:30:16.790 --> 02:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
of the call
 
02:30:20.070 --> 02:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
is an interesting thing to parse
 
02:30:23.110 --> 02:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
so i can't speak explicitly to that but
 
02:30:24.150 --> 02:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
since they're doing a priority
 
02:30:24.160 --> 02:30:25.590 align:start position:0%
since they're doing a priority
investigation

02:30:25.590 --> 02:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
02:30:27.510 --> 02:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
and and i'll use the example of my house
 
02:30:29.349 --> 02:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
burned down when i was a child the fire
 
02:30:31.190 --> 02:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
was reported this is one of the things
 
02:30:33.270 --> 02:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
they talked about the fire was reported
 
02:30:36.870 --> 02:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
by a third party unknown to me for years
 
02:30:36.880 --> 02:30:38.630 align:start position:0%
by a third party unknown to me for years
right

02:30:38.630 --> 02:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:30:40.790 --> 02:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
but the insurance department wanted
 
02:30:42.469 --> 02:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
might want to know
 
02:30:44.469 --> 02:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
who that person was
 
02:30:46.230 --> 02:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
and if they have the nature of the call
 
02:30:48.070 --> 02:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
and they know the approximate
 
02:30:50.710 --> 02:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
i think they would be able to get that
 
02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
or they would have it because it's most
 
02:30:55.110 --> 02:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
often involved in fraud
 
02:30:56.389 --> 02:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
they would be looking for the same
 
02:30:57.750 --> 02:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
individual that's just committing the
 
02:30:57.760 --> 02:31:05.670 align:start position:0%
individual that's just committing the
fraud

02:31:05.670 --> 02:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:07.349 --> 02:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative chair thank you
 
02:31:09.030 --> 02:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question i remember that
 
02:31:11.349 --> 02:31:11.359 align:start position:0%
there was testimony the
 
02:31:13.190 --> 02:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
are we still going to be able to give
 
02:31:15.429 --> 02:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
them when they requested
 
02:31:17.990 --> 02:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
a copy of that call because or you
 
02:31:19.349 --> 02:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
saying they won't get a copy they'll
 
02:31:21.429 --> 02:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
just get the nature and the number
 
02:31:22.870 --> 02:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
because remember he said he was the
 
02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
background information and one of those
 
02:31:26.309 --> 02:31:26.319 align:start position:0%
calls is what tipped them off to that
 
02:31:28.870 --> 02:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
there was fraud
 
02:31:30.550 --> 02:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
i i would suggest that that's what they
 
02:31:31.990 --> 02:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
mean when they say the nature of the
 
02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:33.510 align:start position:0%
mean when they say the nature of the
call

02:31:33.510 --> 02:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
call
 
02:31:35.110 --> 02:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
every part of it
 
02:31:35.120 --> 02:31:35.990 align:start position:0%
every part of it
but

02:31:35.990 --> 02:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:31:37.990 --> 02:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
but so you're not releasing the actual
 
02:31:40.790 --> 02:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
transcripts you're just
 
02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:47.510 --> 02:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
i don't have a better answer than what
 
02:31:49.510 --> 02:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
they asked for
 
02:31:51.830 --> 02:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
and the nature and time is what they ask
 
02:31:51.840 --> 02:31:55.510 align:start position:0%
and the nature and time is what they ask
for

02:31:55.510 --> 02:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:57.110 --> 02:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
that was from testimony directly from
 
02:31:58.710 --> 02:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
the department this is what we're
 
02:32:00.150 --> 02:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
02:32:02.950 --> 02:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
they asked for the actual copy of the
 
02:32:02.960 --> 02:32:03.910 align:start position:0%
they asked for the actual copy of the
um

02:32:03.910 --> 02:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:05.830 --> 02:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
they asked for the recording is my
 
02:32:05.840 --> 02:32:07.990 align:start position:0%
they asked for the recording is my
understanding

02:32:07.990 --> 02:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:08.790 align:start position:0%
understanding
well

02:32:08.790 --> 02:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:32:11.429 --> 02:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
i think there was uh
 
02:32:12.710 --> 02:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
02:32:14.150 --> 02:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
it only applies to criminal
 
02:32:14.160 --> 02:32:15.670 align:start position:0%
it only applies to criminal
investigations

02:32:15.670 --> 02:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
02:32:15.680 --> 02:32:16.630 align:start position:0%
investigations
and

02:32:16.630 --> 02:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:32:19.190 --> 02:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
so when
 
02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
in those circumstances
 
02:32:24.710 --> 02:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
they are able to get warrants they have
 
02:32:27.590 --> 02:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
to go through the police to get warrants
 
02:32:29.590 --> 02:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
but they can get warrants to actually
 
02:32:31.510 --> 02:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
get the calls themselves if they need to
 
02:32:32.469 --> 02:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
do that
 
02:32:34.790 --> 02:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
but the question one of the questions is
 
02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
the timing of the call
 
02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
for example his example was
 
02:32:42.389 --> 02:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
that he used was somebody who called
 
02:32:44.710 --> 02:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
from the accident scene signing up for
 
02:32:54.070 --> 02:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:56.070 --> 02:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
thing is that it would be available just
 
02:32:58.469 --> 02:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
would be two steps they first have to
 
02:33:01.110 --> 02:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
get the nature and the time person and
 
02:33:03.110 --> 02:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
then if they thought that was what they
 
02:33:04.230 --> 02:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
wanted then they would go to law
 
02:33:07.349 --> 02:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement and get the subpoena or
 
02:33:09.030 --> 02:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
warrant if that's what it is for okay
 
02:33:11.110 --> 02:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
it's available one way or the other to
 
02:33:11.120 --> 02:33:16.389 align:start position:0%
it's available one way or the other to
them

02:33:16.389 --> 02:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:18.309 --> 02:33:18.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's available to law enforcement
 
02:33:18.319 --> 02:33:19.670 align:start position:0%
it's it's available to law enforcement
today

02:33:19.670 --> 02:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:33:22.150 --> 02:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
and the issue as i understood it is
 
02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
simply that
 
02:33:26.309 --> 02:33:26.319 align:start position:0%
this investigator for the insurance
 
02:33:29.030 --> 02:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
department is not a law enforcement
 
02:33:31.510 --> 02:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
officer a sworn law enforcement officer
 
02:33:34.469 --> 02:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
therefore he can't get a warrant to get
 
02:33:35.910 --> 02:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
that information
 
02:33:37.670 --> 02:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
and is not entitled the information
 
02:33:39.750 --> 02:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
under the current law but he wants to
 
02:33:41.429 --> 02:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
have access
 
02:33:44.630 --> 02:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
to the time and the nature of the calls
 
02:33:47.349 --> 02:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
probably to get probable cause
 
02:33:56.790 --> 02:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:57.990 --> 02:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
so from
 
02:33:59.990 --> 02:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
a mechanism perspective we're gonna
 
02:34:03.750 --> 02:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
octopass this but keep it off consent
 
02:34:04.790 --> 02:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:34:07.429 --> 02:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
yep you'd have to
 
02:34:08.870 --> 02:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
and then we'll bring the four amendment
 
02:34:12.070 --> 02:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
and if it doesn't meet our expectations
 
02:34:17.830 --> 02:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:19.510 --> 02:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
presuming that if
 
02:34:21.590 --> 02:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
the clerk and
 
02:34:24.150 --> 02:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
representative smith co-sponsor it i'm
 
02:34:27.270 --> 02:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
sure it'll meet our expectations
 
02:34:36.469 --> 02:34:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:41.590 --> 02:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:43.510 --> 02:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:34:45.510 --> 02:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
so i guess what we've decided to do is
 
02:34:48.389 --> 02:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
go forward with approving the current
 
02:34:51.270 --> 02:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
amendment and
 
02:34:52.550 --> 02:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
do we want to approve the current
 
02:34:56.790 --> 02:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:58.710 --> 02:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
to ought to pass
 
02:35:00.550 --> 02:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
do the bill out to pass
 
02:35:00.560 --> 02:35:01.429 align:start position:0%
do the bill out to pass
so

02:35:01.429 --> 02:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:03.750 --> 02:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
do you want to withdraw your motion with
 
02:35:06.469 --> 02:35:06.479 align:start position:0%
regard to ought to pass as amended
 
02:35:08.950 --> 02:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman i'm happy to withdraw my
 
02:35:11.670 --> 02:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
amendment and recreate the thing as a
 
02:35:13.510 --> 02:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
good four amendment
 
02:35:15.030 --> 02:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
okay so here we're drawing your motion
 
02:35:17.429 --> 02:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass is amended and joey are

that

02:35:28.790 --> 02:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:35:30.230 --> 02:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay this is on
 
02:35:33.270 --> 02:35:33.280 align:start position:0%

vote of 21 to nothing and this will not

it with the understanding that there
 
02:37:30.550 --> 02:37:30.560 align:start position:0%

seconded by representative mclean
 
02:38:00.630 --> 02:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
representative murder do you want to
 
02:38:02.790 --> 02:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
address your motion yes we heard
 
02:38:04.550 --> 02:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
testimony um
 
02:38:06.309 --> 02:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
there is
 
02:38:08.070 --> 02:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
stuff that needs to be done
 
02:38:10.150 --> 02:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
but the executive branch has already put
 
02:38:11.910 --> 02:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
together a working group
 
02:38:14.150 --> 02:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
and i don't think there's any uh need
 
02:38:15.750 --> 02:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
for the religious you know the
 
02:38:20.469 --> 02:38:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:20.479 --> 02:38:22.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:38:22.230 --> 02:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:38:26.150 --> 02:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:28.150 --> 02:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
yes representative otter or question
 
02:38:29.670 --> 02:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
rather are the
 
02:38:31.510 --> 02:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
the people that came to testify all the
 
02:38:33.030 --> 02:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
different department heads
 
02:38:34.950 --> 02:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
um are they aware of the executive
 
02:38:40.830 --> 02:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:40.840 --> 02:38:42.710 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:38:42.710 --> 02:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:38:46.469 --> 02:38:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:48.150 --> 02:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
it was brought forth in testimony that
 
02:38:49.349 --> 02:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
they had this and they would kind of
 
02:38:51.750 --> 02:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
like want us to file something to
 
02:38:54.309 --> 02:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
push them along to form a commission so
 
02:38:54.319 --> 02:38:55.030 align:start position:0%
push them along to form a commission so
but

02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:39:00.150 --> 02:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
can i just
 
02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:02.070 align:start position:0%
can i just
sure

02:39:02.070 --> 02:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:39:04.309 --> 02:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
i'm just questioning um because there
 
02:39:06.950 --> 02:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
was the i'm questioning the testimony so
 
02:39:09.270 --> 02:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
you all know about the executive council
 
02:39:10.790 --> 02:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
going to be doing something because of
 
02:39:12.469 --> 02:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
testimony that you heard in here or some
 
02:39:14.790 --> 02:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
other source
 
02:39:17.910 --> 02:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
executive because what what what i heard
 
02:39:19.990 --> 02:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
and what we have is the two amendments
 
02:39:21.429 --> 02:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
from i'm just want to make sure that
 
02:39:22.630 --> 02:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
we're not confused there were the two
 
02:39:24.469 --> 02:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
amendments from
 
02:39:26.150 --> 02:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
senator sherman that he offered that
 
02:39:27.750 --> 02:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
would have changed it from a legislative
 
02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:28.710 align:start position:0%
would have changed it from a legislative
committee

02:39:28.710 --> 02:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:39:31.030 --> 02:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
to an executive
 
02:39:33.670 --> 02:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
working group
 
02:39:36.150 --> 02:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
so we would have had there isn't
 
02:39:38.070 --> 02:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
to my understanding it was just these
 
02:39:40.230 --> 02:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
two amendments which would have changed
 
02:39:40.240 --> 02:39:42.070 align:start position:0%
two amendments which would have changed
um

02:39:42.070 --> 02:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:43.990 --> 02:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
he was offering those for our senator
 
02:39:45.429 --> 02:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
sherman was offering these for our
 
02:39:47.990 --> 02:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
consideration there is no executive
 
02:39:50.309 --> 02:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
study committee right now
 
02:39:52.870 --> 02:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative mclean
 
02:39:55.270 --> 02:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um yeah i think so what
 
02:39:58.469 --> 02:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
happened was the original bill was
 
02:40:00.710 --> 02:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
setting up the commission
 
02:40:03.030 --> 02:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
but they were sensitive to the fact that
 
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of commissions already and
 
02:40:07.270 --> 02:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of weight in that area
 
02:40:09.190 --> 02:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
so what they were saying is that the
 
02:40:11.830 --> 02:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
solution was to and the amendments
 
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
addressed that to convert the commission
 
02:40:15.510 --> 02:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
into a working group within the
 
02:40:17.670 --> 02:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
executive branch and i i think what
 
02:40:19.830 --> 02:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
representative verner was saying that if
 
02:40:21.510 --> 02:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
the executive branch feels that that's
 
02:40:23.190 --> 02:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
the best form
 
02:40:25.590 --> 02:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
then they should
 
02:40:27.990 --> 02:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
is it the place of the legislature to
 
02:40:30.309 --> 02:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
tell the executive branch
 
02:40:32.309 --> 02:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
how that working group should be
 
02:40:34.870 --> 02:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
constituted and i think that was was
 
02:40:36.389 --> 02:40:36.399 align:start position:0%
where we were going with it so you're
 
02:40:38.790 --> 02:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
right it doesn't exist at this point
 
02:40:41.190 --> 02:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
everybody agreed that there was definite
 
02:40:44.630 --> 02:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
value in going back and re-examining the
 
02:40:44.640 --> 02:40:45.990 align:start position:0%
value in going back and re-examining the
definitions

02:40:45.990 --> 02:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
02:40:48.469 --> 02:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
looking at how do we have an effective
 
02:40:50.790 --> 02:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
approach to restoring competency
 
02:40:52.630 --> 02:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
but who is the legislature to tell the
 
02:40:55.110 --> 02:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
executive branch what the
 
02:40:57.190 --> 02:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
constituency of that executive group
 
02:41:01.349 --> 02:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:04.070 --> 02:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
02:41:06.309 --> 02:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much mr chair i
 
02:41:08.150 --> 02:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
have a slightly different take on it
 
02:41:11.429 --> 02:41:11.439 align:start position:0%
there already exists
 
02:41:11.439 --> 02:41:12.230 align:start position:0%
there already exists
um

02:41:12.230 --> 02:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:13.910 --> 02:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
a working group
 
02:41:18.070 --> 02:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
um and the chair of the working group
 
02:41:21.190 --> 02:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
indicated to us that she had been having
 
02:41:23.510 --> 02:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
a great deal of difficulty
 
02:41:26.309 --> 02:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
getting people to show up
 
02:41:30.309 --> 02:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
getting people to participate um she
 
02:41:34.070 --> 02:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
joked about having to provide donuts
 
02:41:35.990 --> 02:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
her first mistake is that she should
 
02:41:38.469 --> 02:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
have provided rugola but that's that's a
 
02:41:41.510 --> 02:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
02:41:46.070 --> 02:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
what she felt was that she
 
02:41:48.309 --> 02:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
they needed the strong arm of the
 
02:41:48.319 --> 02:41:50.309 align:start position:0%
they needed the strong arm of the
legislature

02:41:50.309 --> 02:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
02:41:53.269 --> 02:41:53.279 align:start position:0%
to um
 
02:41:56.070 --> 02:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
encourage the members
 
02:41:59.510 --> 02:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
of her group to do what they in fact are
 
02:42:01.590 --> 02:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to do
 
02:42:05.030 --> 02:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
and um and that
 
02:42:08.070 --> 02:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
to me is is a basic
 
02:42:10.150 --> 02:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
is a basic problem
 
02:42:10.160 --> 02:42:11.030 align:start position:0%
is a basic problem
um

02:42:11.030 --> 02:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:14.389 --> 02:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
the idea that only when we tell the
 
02:42:17.030 --> 02:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
members of the executive branch what to
 
02:42:18.469 --> 02:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
do do they carry out their
 
02:42:20.790 --> 02:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
responsibilities i have problems with
 
02:42:22.150 --> 02:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
that idea
 
02:42:24.070 --> 02:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
i also um
 
02:42:24.080 --> 02:42:24.830 align:start position:0%
i also um
have

02:42:24.830 --> 02:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:42:28.550 --> 02:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh problems with the two issues being in
 
02:42:29.990 --> 02:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
the same bill
 
02:42:34.469 --> 02:42:34.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of the definition of insanity
 
02:42:37.429 --> 02:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
which i know the wheels grind slowly but
 
02:42:39.830 --> 02:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
i somehow think that we might want to
 
02:42:42.950 --> 02:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
get into the 21st century
 
02:42:45.990 --> 02:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
like the late 20th century even in terms
 
02:42:48.710 --> 02:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
of a definition of insanity and i find
 
02:42:52.230 --> 02:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
that very different and separate
 
02:42:54.630 --> 02:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
from the issue of competency
 
02:42:56.790 --> 02:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
which the group
 
02:42:56.800 --> 02:42:58.469 align:start position:0%
which the group
presented

02:42:58.469 --> 02:42:58.479 align:start position:0%
presented
 
02:43:01.990 --> 02:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of um
 
02:43:04.550 --> 02:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
the for
 
02:43:07.030 --> 02:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
the proposed um
 
02:43:07.040 --> 02:43:09.429 align:start position:0%
the proposed um
hospital

02:43:09.429 --> 02:43:09.439 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
02:43:14.230 --> 02:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
and so i have problems with all of that
 
02:43:17.750 --> 02:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
that having been said
 
02:43:20.710 --> 02:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
the issue itself
 
02:43:25.349 --> 02:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
is an important issue and barring um
 
02:43:27.349 --> 02:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
other means of getting people to do what
 
02:43:29.269 --> 02:43:29.279 align:start position:0%
they ought to be doing i would
 
02:43:29.279 --> 02:43:31.030 align:start position:0%
they ought to be doing i would
reluctantly

02:43:31.030 --> 02:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
reluctantly
 
02:43:34.070 --> 02:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
very reluctantly vote ought to pass on
 
02:43:36.870 --> 02:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:43:36.880 --> 02:43:40.389 align:start position:0%
the bill
comments

02:43:40.389 --> 02:43:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:42.790 --> 02:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
i think i'd echo a lot of what
 
02:43:44.870 --> 02:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative smith said only maybe
 
02:43:47.269 --> 02:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
come to a different conclusion but
 
02:43:47.279 --> 02:43:48.710 align:start position:0%
come to a different conclusion but
the

02:43:48.710 --> 02:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:43:50.389 --> 02:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
two different the bill first of all
 
02:43:53.030 --> 02:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
deals with two entirely different issues
 
02:43:54.950 --> 02:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
one is the definition of insanity the
 
02:43:58.630 --> 02:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
other one is a process for determining
 
02:44:02.150 --> 02:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
and addressing competency for people who
 
02:44:05.750 --> 02:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
are standing trial and so they're two
 
02:44:07.349 --> 02:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
separate issues but apparently one
 
02:44:09.269 --> 02:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
commission to deal with these two
 
02:44:11.429 --> 02:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
separate issues which i'm
 
02:44:12.710 --> 02:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
02:44:14.870 --> 02:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
why you need to have all those members
 
02:44:16.950 --> 02:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with both of those issues
 
02:44:20.309 --> 02:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
and and the person that impressed me was
 
02:44:23.429 --> 02:44:23.439 align:start position:0%
dr bader who was here and the who was
 
02:44:25.990 --> 02:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
the uh chief forensic officer for the
 
02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:26.950 align:start position:0%
the uh chief forensic officer for the
state

02:44:26.950 --> 02:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:44:30.070 --> 02:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
because what what she she was explaining
 
02:44:31.349 --> 02:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
the need
 
02:44:33.190 --> 02:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
for these things and clearly
 
02:44:35.349 --> 02:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
there's a need to redefine insanity but
 
02:44:38.230 --> 02:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh it seems to me that our
 
02:44:39.750 --> 02:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
that the people that should be doing
 
02:44:42.070 --> 02:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
that are within
 
02:44:44.070 --> 02:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
state government today and you don't
 
02:44:46.230 --> 02:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
need to get a group of 30 people
 
02:44:48.710 --> 02:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
together in order to do that it just
 
02:44:50.950 --> 02:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem reasonable to me
 
02:44:52.550 --> 02:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
and then the second part is the issue of
 
02:44:55.590 --> 02:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
competency and what
 
02:44:58.070 --> 02:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
dr bader was saying was
 
02:45:00.469 --> 02:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
we're the state i think we she
 
02:45:02.790 --> 02:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
described us as 50th among the states in
 
02:45:05.269 --> 02:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
terms of the way we address competency
 
02:45:06.230 --> 02:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:45:08.630 --> 02:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
somebody can't stand trial they're not
 
02:45:10.550 --> 02:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
competent to stand trial
 
02:45:12.710 --> 02:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
we don't have a process in order to make
 
02:45:14.309 --> 02:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
we have to make them competent within a
 
02:45:15.990 --> 02:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
year to stand trial and we don't really
 
02:45:17.990 --> 02:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
have any process to do that so basically
 
02:45:19.750 --> 02:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
we're just letting people go
 
02:45:19.760 --> 02:45:20.550 align:start position:0%
we're just letting people go
and

02:45:20.550 --> 02:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:45:23.110 --> 02:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
when they can't stand trial and which
 
02:45:25.030 --> 02:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense and other states
 
02:45:28.309 --> 02:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
have processes to do that because they
 
02:45:30.469 --> 02:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
provide the services to do that and in
 
02:45:32.870 --> 02:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
our state we don't provide services for
 
02:45:35.269 --> 02:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
people to do that we say you're on your
 
02:45:35.279 --> 02:45:36.070 align:start position:0%
people to do that we say you're on your
own

02:45:36.070 --> 02:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
own
 
02:45:38.710 --> 02:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
get yourself competent
 
02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:39.510 align:start position:0%
get yourself competent
but

02:45:39.510 --> 02:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:45:43.030 --> 02:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
my impression was dr bader already knows
 
02:45:44.790 --> 02:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
what needs to be done
 
02:45:46.790 --> 02:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
we don't need a 30-member study
 
02:45:46.800 --> 02:45:47.910 align:start position:0%
we don't need a 30-member study
committee

02:45:47.910 --> 02:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:45:49.910 --> 02:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
to figure that out i think she already
 
02:45:52.710 --> 02:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
knows what the state uh uh and there
 
02:45:54.150 --> 02:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
ought to be a recommendation and it
 
02:45:55.590 --> 02:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
seems to me that the whole purpose
 
02:45:57.429 --> 02:45:57.439 align:start position:0%
behind this
 
02:45:57.439 --> 02:45:58.469 align:start position:0%
behind this
committee

02:45:58.469 --> 02:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:46:02.389 --> 02:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
wasn't necessarily to
 
02:46:04.230 --> 02:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
address the problem and figure out the
 
02:46:05.990 --> 02:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
problem because i think she knows the
 
02:46:07.670 --> 02:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
answer to the problem that
 
02:46:09.910 --> 02:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
what it was is to provide the motivation
 
02:46:11.510 --> 02:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
and the direction to get the funding to
 
02:46:12.790 --> 02:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
do it
 
02:46:12.800 --> 02:46:14.230 align:start position:0%
do it
eventually

02:46:14.230 --> 02:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
02:46:14.240 --> 02:46:15.349 align:start position:0%
eventually
and

02:46:15.349 --> 02:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:46:17.190 --> 02:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
i just don't think we need to do that i
 
02:46:18.389 --> 02:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
think they
 
02:46:20.070 --> 02:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
should come forward and make that
 
02:46:21.670 --> 02:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation and tell us what we need
 
02:46:23.830 --> 02:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
to do as a state and and i think we
 
02:46:25.750 --> 02:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
probably should fund it but
 
02:46:27.269 --> 02:46:27.279 align:start position:0%
that's my thought but i'm going to vote
 
02:46:31.910 --> 02:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:33.750 --> 02:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:46:35.670 --> 02:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
i just want to explain why i am going to
 
02:46:38.389 --> 02:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
be joining you in your vote because i i
 
02:46:40.309 --> 02:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
really was moved by the testimony and i
 
02:46:41.670 --> 02:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
think that these are issues that are
 
02:46:44.469 --> 02:46:44.479 align:start position:0%
really important to the state and to
 
02:46:47.269 --> 02:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
our citizens and um
 
02:46:49.670 --> 02:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
i i wish it was bifurcated i wish there
 
02:46:53.110 --> 02:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
were two issues i wish that um i i do
 
02:46:55.349 --> 02:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
support study committees but i want to
 
02:46:57.670 --> 02:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
be sure that when we pull all of our you
 
02:46:59.590 --> 02:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
know these like these appointed people
 
02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
and our staff off of their work that
 
02:47:03.670 --> 02:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's going to be for a good reason and
 
02:47:05.429 --> 02:47:05.439 align:start position:0%
i'm not confident that this study
 
02:47:06.950 --> 02:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
committee the way it's structured with
 
02:47:09.030 --> 02:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
the charges is the way to go so
 
02:47:11.830 --> 02:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
um i i do support changing the
 
02:47:13.830 --> 02:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
definition i do support coming up with
 
02:47:15.429 --> 02:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
ways to restore competency and having
 
02:47:16.790 --> 02:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
programs and treatments for that but
 
02:47:18.309 --> 02:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
this this is i'm not going to be
 
02:47:22.389 --> 02:47:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:26.150 --> 02:47:26.160 align:start position:0%

the
 
02:53:12.070 --> 02:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
the remaining issues are
 
02:53:15.429 --> 02:53:15.439 align:start position:0%
fallen two groups one is assuming that

the house agrees to our
 
02:53:19.510 --> 02:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
02:53:21.269 --> 02:53:21.279 align:start position:0%
we would be forming into

02:55:05.910 --> 02:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
this time you
 
02:55:08.230 --> 02:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
you know i i hear all the time in terms
 
02:55:10.550 --> 02:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
of committees and committees that do
 
02:55:11.910 --> 02:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
their jobs that
 
02:55:13.990 --> 02:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
we seem to get along better than just
 
02:55:16.469 --> 02:55:16.479 align:start position:0%
about anybody out there and and it's
 
02:55:18.150 --> 02:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
just i think it's a credit to you but
 
02:55:20.389 --> 02:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
it's a credit to all of you for being
 
02:55:22.150 --> 02:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
cordial and
 
02:55:24.870 --> 02:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
being respectful of each other and you
 
02:55:25.990 --> 02:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
know it's just
 
02:55:27.510 --> 02:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
just an honor to be here really it's
 
02:55:30.469 --> 02:55:30.479 align:start position:0%
just a great committee
 
02:55:40.309 --> 02:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:42.389 --> 02:55:42.399 align:start position:0%
and i guess unless anybody else has
 
02:55:44.469 --> 02:55:44.479 align:start position:0%
anything else we're
 
02:55:46.710 --> 02:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
i guess research that the call of the
 
02:55:48.469 --> 02:55:48.479 align:start position:0%
chair hopefully we don't need to come
 
02:55:51.030 --> 02:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
back for another meeting like this
 
02:56:08.150 --> 02:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:08.160 --> 02:56:29.429 align:start position:0%

02:56:29.429 --> 02:56:29.439 align:start position:0%
