the um in the preliminary report there
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%

00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:29.079 align:start position:0%
preliminary report by November 1st which
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
which is in a couple of days um the
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
committee has been authorized to
 
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:37.160 align:start position:0%
continue into the next bium for another
 
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
year at which point the committee will
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
issue a a final
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
report um so um I put together some
 
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
thoughts and um I put them into a Word
 
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
document and printed it all up for you
 
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
and forgot them on my printer at home
 
00:14:59.710 --> 00:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
and realized that that when I was
 
00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:03.399 align:start position:0%
halfway here so um our researcher is in
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
the process of copying them and there
 
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
she is so you can you'll have something
 
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
to um you know to work off of as we are
 
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
report thank
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
you isn't there another member of the
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
committee yes that that um yes that
 
00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
representative Welsh is in theory on the
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
committee so I guess his name probably
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
should be on the report shouldn't it
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
no yeah that's why you know that's why
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
report I just did this from the second
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
page there is a cover page also that I
 
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
think we were emailed last week
 
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
um it says the names of the people to
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
okay so I I I had another thing that I
 
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
noticed um Kristen on the first page of
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
that report is that it lists the state
 
00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:25.759 align:start position:0%
Librarian Is Michael York and I believe
 
00:16:40.829 --> 00:16:40.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
I believe he has retired he's he's
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
city right or if there's an
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
interim okay all right thank you okay
 
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah before we go to the the finding
 
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
section of it
 
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
um um the committee charge and study
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
purpose um number two says that the
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
committee shall solicit information and
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
there's a long list of PE of
 
00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
organizations that we were supposed to
 
00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.029 align:start position:0%
organizations that we were supposed to
have

00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
um spoken with and we did speak with a
 
00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:40.919 align:start position:0%
lot of them but
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
um there there are some that we
 
00:17:48.909 --> 00:17:48.919 align:start position:0%
missed so the actual law as
 
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
written had a list of organizations that
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
we were supposed to meet with and um
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
receive testimony from and we got most
 
00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
of them but we did not get all of them
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
so I think one of the recommendations
 
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
should be that we follow up with um
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
individuals and organizations mentioned
 
00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
in the law that um were unable to
 
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
testify before us are you okay with that
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
um you not all of them it seemed to say
 
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
that you you you
 
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
were saying that not all of them came to
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
testify but in the law it just requires
 
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
that we solicit them so did we reach out
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
to all of
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
them and maybe some of them didn't
 
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
respond I believe that there were some
 
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
that I did not get to reach out to okay
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
because I was unable to find contact
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
information for them or I just was
 
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
um whatever the reason disorganized
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
there were you know like um like uh
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire Services I did
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
not reach out to them we did you know we
 
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
did hear from the community support
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
network which is you know an an an
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
umbrella Organization for
 
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.190 align:start position:0%
umbrella Organization for
the

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
providers um but I think you
 
00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
know that one of our recommendations can
 
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
be to make certain that we reach out to
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
individuals who were not
 
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
um contacted or who who were not able to
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
provide provide testimony during that
 
00:19:36.149 --> 00:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
so that's good it covers your the bases
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
of the report and the
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
law um did you happen to see the email
 
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
that I sent a little while ago to you
 
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
yes I did okay okay so and I think that
 
00:19:57.549 --> 00:19:57.559 align:start position:0%
on the first on the first recommendation
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
which is you know try to deal with the
 
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
distinct the distinction between
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
certification and lure
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
that's um your your thoughts seem to be
 
00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
related to figuring out how to get
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
around that threers thing so why don't
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
you go ahead and explain what you said
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
to me so what I was um so I sent kind of
 
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
like some draft thoughts to the the
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
chair earlier today um
 
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
and what I one of the things the first
 
00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:35.559 align:start position:0%
thing that was listed um on my draft
 
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
like one of the things that I was
 
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
thinking about was um the definition of
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
facility but um I looked at um
 
00:20:48.669 --> 00:20:48.679 align:start position:0%
e- m1001 certification standards for
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
development to services and Community
 
00:20:53.549 --> 00:20:53.559 align:start position:0%
residences and they didn't specifically
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
Define facility but they defined
 
00:20:55.799 --> 00:20:57.070 align:start position:0%
Define facility but they defined
Community

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
Community
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
residence which means either agency
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
residence or a family residence
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
exclusive of independent living
 
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
arrangements so family
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
resident um
 
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.549 align:start position:0%
resident um
is

00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:11.559 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
defined um in the same section saying
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
Family Residence means a community
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
residence essential uh
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
operated a a specific way and so those
 
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
are circular definitions one refers to
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
the other and I think that actually a
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
family res um a family
 
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.710 align:start position:0%
family res um a family
residence

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
residence
 
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
uh we could
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
potentially uh discuss with
 
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
DHHS changing
 
00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
that circular reference back to um say a
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
family residence means a residential
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
unit um instead of uh Community
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
residents and so residential units
 
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
generally like if you have an apartment
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
it has multiple residential units and so
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
you can have Apartment A and Apartment B
 
00:22:10.029 --> 00:22:10.039 align:start position:0%
and those would be two separate
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
facilities even though they're in the
 
00:22:15.549 --> 00:22:15.559 align:start position:0%
same building possibly and so you know
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
if if you have two children that are are
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh developmentally disabled or whatever
 
00:22:27.549 --> 00:22:27.559 align:start position:0%
and receiving services and then a person
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
in the same building that's not even
 
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
related to you you don't know them like
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
they also have two people that are also
 
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
receiving services that you're somehow
 
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
not required now to be licensed in some
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
way um and so maybe discussing that uh
 
00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
kind of language change might uh address
 
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
some of the the concerns that I have
 
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
especially for the low hanging fruit
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
like that um that I'm that I'm thinking
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
about maybe um we could Define
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
residential unit within this area like I
 
00:23:08.669 --> 00:23:08.679 align:start position:0%
just pulled off a uh something off
 
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
online that said housing unit is a
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
single unit within a larger structure
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
that can be used in individual household
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
to sleep eat and live and so if you know
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
if you have a lease or whatever for that
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
apartment then that's kind of could be
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
your your residential uh what is it
 
00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:30.919 align:start position:0%
called residential family residents and
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
I think that's what they were trying to
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
get at um and not um kind of classifying
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
the entire structure and so I think that
 
00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:43.799 align:start position:0%
working with them on that because it's
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
technically in a rules so it's not
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily a law
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
change um that would be required it
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
might just have to go to the rules
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
committee or something to get uh a
 
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
language change uh to see if that is
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
possible to be changed
 
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh I think that was is something that
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
that was the first thing that I
 
00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
thought um just so everyone on the on
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
the committee knows I I'll go down to
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
the second one I think that we should be
 
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
recommending legislation that allows
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
sorry that allows um I what I heard from
 
00:24:24.909 --> 00:24:24.919 align:start position:0%
the testimony is that people uh with
 
00:24:28.029 --> 00:24:28.039 align:start position:0%
disabilities often that may not even be
 
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
receiving Services May rely on The
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
Neighbor Next Door or the or the person
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
in the apartment across from them to be
 
00:24:39.149 --> 00:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
helping them with rare needs but with
 
00:24:41.789 --> 00:24:41.799 align:start position:0%
needs that they have that if they didn't
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
have that person that resource may not
 
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
be able to be independent and may have
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
to be in a more structured kind of like
 
00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
living environment so encouraging um
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
duplexes triplexes quadruplexes a and um
 
00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.590 align:start position:0%
duplexes triplexes quadruplexes a and um
and

00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
adus where the people are relatively
 
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
close together um should be something
 
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
that is seen as as uh helping those that
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
are not not disabled enough to need to
 
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
go to like round the-clock care but may
 
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
need you know help bringing out the
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
garbage or or bringing up um you know uh
 
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
groceries or something that is you know
 
00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
uh a rare occurrence but
 
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
but maybe need may be needed nonetheless
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
that can be seen as something that that
 
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
could be a barrier to them and then next
 
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
I thought that um we we heard that kind
 
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
of not not all of the people with
 
00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.630 align:start position:0%
of not not all of the people with
disabilities

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
drive and also spent find it expensive
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
or hard to come by the um
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
transportation and so having uh the
 
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.789 align:start position:0%
transportation and so having uh the
ability

00:26:05.789 --> 00:26:05.799 align:start position:0%
ability
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
to either have um within commercial
 
00:26:13.389 --> 00:26:13.399 align:start position:0%
districts mixed use uh buildings that
 
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
have residential and and businesses in
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
the same building so that they could you
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
know go downstairs to the grocery store
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
or to the coffee shop or whatever and
 
00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to travel for every single
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
thing in their life that might be a a
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
beneficial uh opportunity for some that
 
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
that need that and or walking walk being
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
able to walk or and or roll if necessary
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
to the uh to a business next door or
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
something like that so if they had a
 
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
sidewalk or something like that that may
 
00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:53.240 align:start position:0%
also help those people that are um not
 
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:55.720 align:start position:0%
able and you know not even just people
 
00:26:57.389 --> 00:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
that are disabled people that can't
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
drive um for whatever reason even if
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
they're not disabled um you know got in
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
trouble with the law or whatever too too
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
many DUIs like that's that that could be
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
some um a a situation that would be
 
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
helpful for those people not just the
 
00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
disabled communities so I think that um
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
is something that the state should kind
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
of encourage if not say like hey if you
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
you know you're you need to
 
00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:27.039 align:start position:0%
be not kind of forcing everyone into
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
just Manchester and NASA that but we
 
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
want people to be able to live in their
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
own communities and so you need to have
 
00:27:35.789 --> 00:27:35.799 align:start position:0%
some place in your community that can be
 
00:27:40.269 --> 00:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
able to meet these these guidelines um
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
the next thing I was talking about was
 
00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:44.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Housing Authority um may
 
00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
or may not be able to use its loans that
 
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
it provides um for the creation of
 
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.110 align:start position:0%
it provides um for the creation of
community

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:27:56.909 --> 00:27:56.919 align:start position:0%
resides under uh the
 
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
hm11 uh so I wanted to make sure that
 
00:28:04.509 --> 00:28:04.519 align:start position:0%
that if the legislature needs to say
 
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
like hey they can can get this loan if
 
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
they want to purchase this property and
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
and provide services there that that
 
00:28:13.509 --> 00:28:13.519 align:start position:0%
they would be able to take advantage of
 
00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
that because we are like one of the
 
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
thing that it is we are trying to do is
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to allow multif family
 
00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:25.519 align:start position:0%
housing or or or low uh or just uh
 
00:28:29.149 --> 00:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
affordable housing options and so
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
um if like just having more um
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
opportunities for these disabled people
 
00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
could bring the cost cost cost down um
 
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
for them and not just uh you know for
 
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
everyone else cons and then um then my
 
00:28:49.149 --> 00:28:49.159 align:start position:0%
last thing was kind of concern in
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
general that I that the testimony that
 
00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
that we are studying um how how the
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
impact of housing crisis
 
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:01.039 align:start position:0%
affected people with disabilities and a
 
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
lot of the testimony had to do with
 
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities and not so
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
much about physical disabilities and I
 
00:29:11.789 --> 00:29:11.799 align:start position:0%
had a little concern that that we may be
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
a want to be soliciting
 
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
some some testimony specifically from
 
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
people that um have physical disability
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
so that we make sure that we're kind of
 
00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.269 align:start position:0%
so that we make sure that we're kind of
being

00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
like addressing the entire
 
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
Community all right those are those are
 
00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
the things that I came up off top of my
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
head thank you so much for doing that
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
um okay all right so
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
um can let
 
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
um let me just um go through the
 
00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
findings that I put down and see if
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
there's anything that we want add um the
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
first finding that I had was the
 
00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
certification versus lure distinction is
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
a barrier to developing new housing for
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
people with developmental disabilities
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
it adds significant cost to construction
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
maintenance and management of these
 
00:30:15.389 --> 00:30:15.399 align:start position:0%
types of developments and I think that
 
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that um you
 
00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:21.799 align:start position:0%
were talking about with the um change in
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
that definition so um do we all agree
 
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
that that um
 
00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:31.039 align:start position:0%
is something that we uncovered during
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
this um um process and um are there
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
changes that you think we should make to
 
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
the wording there
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
um do you think it needs to be more
 
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
specific or is
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
that I agree with you we heard a lot
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
from um the people in the community that
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
there's too much confusion on these
 
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
definitions and there's no one place for
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
anyone to go and actually get help I
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
think we should take those suggestions
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
that were given to us um try to and work
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
with the department so that we can
 
00:31:10.509 --> 00:31:10.519 align:start position:0%
remove any objections and then we could
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
maybe make that change and that would be
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
a good stepping stone to um what what
 
00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:17.919 align:start position:0%
else we have to do
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
right right and we may uncover other in
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
the process we may uncover other things
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
that we might be able to do through Ru
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
making or legislation that will make it
 
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
easy easier for um individuals or groups
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
that want to build housing for people
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
with developmental
 
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
disabilities okay all right the the next
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
finding um and this was specifically
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
from Gia the grand State Independent
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
Living folks um there is a severe
 
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
shortage of units in the state to
 
00:31:51.789 --> 00:31:51.799 align:start position:0%
accommodate people with physical
 
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
disabilities less than 5% of housing
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
units are considered accessible and less
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
than 1% are wheelchair share accessible
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
and retrofitting existing buildings is
 
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
difficult and expensive so that was
 
00:32:06.909 --> 00:32:06.919 align:start position:0%
something that we heard from um Grand
 
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
living and you
 
00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:15.519 align:start position:0%
know is
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
that do we agree that that was a finding
 
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:25.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
differently go ahead yeah I I
 
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
didn't take away I maybe from from them
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
but other people um that I don't believe
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
a that that the state should be
 
00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:45.559 align:start position:0%
essentially saying that every house you
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
know needs to to have this certain kind
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
of structure like that you have to build
 
00:32:54.509 --> 00:32:54.519 align:start position:0%
the bedrooms on the first floor whatever
 
00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
the bathroom has to be curbless or
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
something like that like that feel like
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
those I think those are individual
 
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
design choices within you know family
 
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
residences um and it's good to know like
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
the being able to how the difficulty of
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
moving in between locations for a person
 
00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:18.919 align:start position:0%
with disability but I don't think that
 
00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
the uh the
 
00:33:25.789 --> 00:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
intention should necessarily be that
 
00:33:28.269 --> 00:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
that we have to do 100% you know
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
Universal Design on every building in
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
the state kind of a thing I don't think
 
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
that that is something
 
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
that it can be brought up as maybe like
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
encouragements um but I don't think that
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
it at least that's what a feeling I got
 
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
from the testimony that it shouldn't be
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
mandated that we that everyone do a
 
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
Universal Design or something like that
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
right okay representative lontine and
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
then represent and then uh senator
 
00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.430 align:start position:0%
then represent and then uh senator
richardi

00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
richardi
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I agree with some of that but I
 
00:34:03.629 --> 00:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
think what we wanted to do um was first
 
00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:05.919 align:start position:0%
identify the problems that we found and
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
then we say move on to recommendations
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
unless you want to deal with each of
 
00:34:12.669 --> 00:34:12.679 align:start position:0%
those finding and recommendations one at
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
a time what do you want it do you know
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
what I'm
 
00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
saying yeah okay like we were doing them
 
00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
or we just say for each we'll discuss
 
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
what we found and then discuss the
 
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation for each one one of a
 
00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
time okay all right well Senator Richard
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
yeah I was thinking the same thing we
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
have we probably should be identifying
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
first if there's something we can do
 
00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:41.079 align:start position:0%
this upcoming session legislatively like
 
00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
maybe fix the rules I think we should
 
00:34:46.349 --> 00:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
tackle that and and nudge things forward
 
00:34:49.069 --> 00:34:49.079 align:start position:0%
but identifying a lot of these problems
 
00:34:51.869 --> 00:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
the solution is not uh quick and we're
 
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
gonna have to try to find the these
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
Solutions right right well um it I I
 
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
think um uh representative lon's uh
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
point is well taken um one thing that I
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
did put in recommendations directly in
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
response to that was um to investigate
 
00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
whether existing Housing Programs such
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
as the New Hampshire Housing Trust or
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
the 79e program can be used to
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
incentivize Builders to include
 
00:35:20.349 --> 00:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
Universal Design in new construction
 
00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
projects because um you know and we were
 
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
we had asked the folks from New
 
00:35:29.069 --> 00:35:29.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing to give us some um um
 
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
some information on what the
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
differential and cost would be um
 
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
between just building a a unit and
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
building one that was um um built to be
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
accessible so that that was just you
 
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
know what what I something that I
 
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
thought we could look into as as an
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
mandate agree with that I mean did you
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
get get the response back because I'm I
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
I heard that there was there was um
 
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
concern that retrofitting existing
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
buildings is difficult and expensive
 
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
obviously um maybe to Universal Design
 
00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:11.720 align:start position:0%
that would be but maybe if
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
someone just needed you know a curb
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
shower or something it wouldn't
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily be
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
um prohibitively expensive you know if
 
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
you needed to widen the the the the
 
00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
hallways or something maybe that would
 
00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.190 align:start position:0%
hallways or something maybe that would
be

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
but um and so I didn't I don't remember
 
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
seeing uh the the answer of how how uh
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
expensive it was um in
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
general so I'm not sure that I
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
can L go ahead as someone that does um a
 
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
lot of bath remodeling work it would add
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of money I mean the cheapest
 
00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
bathroom you could build is just buy a a
 
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:00.839 align:start position:0%
curbed shower stall and installing it
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
and then doing anything custom to make
 
00:37:03.359 --> 00:37:04.270 align:start position:0%
and then doing anything custom to make
it

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
accessible is a lot more money like 50
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
to 100% more but that doesn't
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
mean um I mean my thoughts on this
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
subject is that
 
00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.470 align:start position:0%
subject is that
any

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
um new uh multifamily project needs to
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
make a certain percent of those units um
 
00:37:28.109 --> 00:37:28.119 align:start position:0%
with universal divine
 
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
design even if it's
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
retrofitting uh a 3un um apartment
 
00:37:37.309 --> 00:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
building do a whole remodel it make you
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
know one of them has to be accessible
 
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
but I I agree that mandating that every
 
00:37:47.069 --> 00:37:47.079 align:start position:0%
new unit be built to Universal Design
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
would put would increase the cost of
 
00:37:52.349 --> 00:37:52.359 align:start position:0%
housing tremendously and therefore we're
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
we're causing a lot of other problems
 
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
for people who need housing we we need
 
00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:58.349 align:start position:0%
for people who need housing we we need
more

00:37:58.349 --> 00:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:38:02.109 --> 00:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.119 --> 00:38:03.670 align:start position:0%
 
resources

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
Senator I'm just thinking out loud so
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
this may not be a good idea but um a
 
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
couple sessions ago I worked with the
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Housing Authority and Ben
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
Frost to do a p a pilot
 
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
program was for to make things
 
00:38:24.309 --> 00:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
affordable so the American dream is to
 
00:38:26.349 --> 00:38:26.359 align:start position:0%
own your own home and that really hasn't
 
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
changed it's just not affordable it's
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
not affordable for families with
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
disabilities it's not affordable for
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
single people young families but they
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
want that even if it's small and and
 
00:38:43.309 --> 00:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
Tiny and in a community and so I it took
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of traction and I got the bill
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
very far but then it ultimately uh died
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering to address the
 
00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:56.680 align:start position:0%
fact of choice where some families with
 
00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
disabilities want to live in in
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
communities with all people I'm
 
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
wondering if I reintroduce this pilot as
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
a good test see what if it passes what
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
kind of progress and it will include all
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
people but it's but a priority for
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
families with
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
disabilities and um these are actually
 
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:22.280 align:start position:0%
made I got the idea from Maine and
 
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
they're actually made out of
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
um like a concrete but they're beautiful
 
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
um with 3D printing and I it's really
 
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
amazing it would be affordable for the
 
00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
state dep partner in this because I
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
already got them to agree to do it as a
 
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
pilot in general it just didn't get all
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
the way through the process so again I'm
 
00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
thinking out loud but it would be a test
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
and it would fulfill uh AB broad
 
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
families with disabilities like this
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
committee has been tasked with but it'll
 
00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
also help with anyone else you'll have
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
to qualify there'll be a process um and
 
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
I just again I apologize I'm just
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
thinking out loud as something that we
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
could maybe try legislatively for now in
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
conjunction with making it easier with
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
the rule change and I've been talking to
 
00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
the um New Hampshire Builders
 
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:17.720 align:start position:0%
Association um in trying to work with me
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
and work with um the uh with Ben Frost
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
and so I'm going down the path of giving
 
00:40:26.349 --> 00:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
that a whirl I just want to know if
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
there's any support support for that
 
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
room let me I I think that's a cool idea
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
and I think that where you're looking at
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
um everything being 3D
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
printed then it would just be a matter
 
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
of the design being different um in
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
order to be accommodating because you
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
you know you're not you won't you
 
00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be dealing with wood or what
 
00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
you'd be dealing with a plastic sub
 
00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
substance that could be
 
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
include ramps wider doorways Etc but you
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
know I don't really know enough about uh
 
00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
I'm just speculating that that's how
 
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
that works because I haven't really done
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
it but um yeah that's that seems like an
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
interesting idea yeah I I would
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor that with you okay okay
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that I understood what
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
the the pilot program was exactly
 
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
because I mean I've seen the 3D printing
 
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
of houses before um are you are you
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the pilot program was so
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
that some 3D printed houses are done in
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or the pilot program was
 
00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
like subsidizing like the the uh the
 
00:41:52.829 --> 00:41:52.839 align:start position:0%
loan of of it or how how what was the
 
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
exact nature of the pil it needs to be
 
00:41:57.069 --> 00:41:57.079 align:start position:0%
worked out a little bit better but it
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
was was a a combination of all the above
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
the reason it didn't get through is in
 
00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
finance um we had the housing Champion
 
00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
Bill and it was just too much money so
 
00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
they mine got swept away but I think it
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
could be Revisited and the details
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
worked out um but this time we could
 
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
have the
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
focus on all affordable but making sure
 
00:42:22.829 --> 00:42:22.839 align:start position:0%
there's a priority for families with
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
disabilities I don't know how I'm going
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
to do that or if I should but I think
 
00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
there's potential
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
there I just have to work with the
 
00:42:39.549 --> 00:42:39.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
knowledge representative lonte you have
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
the most building experience of anyone
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
here do you know what do you know about
 
00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
3D printed
 
00:42:50.549 --> 00:42:50.559 align:start position:0%
houses I don't know anything about them
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
but my first thought is like where do
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
you get all the plastic to feed into
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
that printer I mean PL it's it's not
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
plastic it's concrete oh okay I I have
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
seen a little bit they have a big it's
 
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
like a nozzle that goes around and
 
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
prints the walls and then you can have
 
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
it like plastered or whatever so that
 
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
it's instead of having like The Ridges
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
it it's all looks like flat but it's
 
00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
it's totally awesome but there's there's
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
multiple ways that you can get I imagine
 
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
you would still need a lot of um finish
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
work and other surfaces that
 
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
involve labor and materials to make it
 
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
so you're not just living in a concrete
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
cell I mean you still need electrical
 
00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:43.240 align:start position:0%
wiring and plumbing I mean I don't know
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
that it would be a huge cost savings but
 
00:43:50.349 --> 00:43:50.359 align:start position:0%
it's yeah so it seems like it's quite a
 
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
few years down the road before that's
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
yeah well you know they are doing it in
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
Main and and I I the thing with the
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
plumbing and the um and the electrical
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
most of that would be the same for uh
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
whether you were building the house for
 
00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:12.280 align:start position:0%
able-bodied people or or or with um a
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
family that had someone with a
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
disability I think again the additional
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
expense would go toward you know things
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
like bathroom fixtures Etc that you're
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
not going to make out of poured concrete
 
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
yeah that be
 
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
scratchy senator they look nice I mean
 
00:44:29.309 --> 00:44:29.319 align:start position:0%
if you see how nice you'd never know
 
00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:31.640 align:start position:0%
they're just they're small but that's
 
00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.950 align:start position:0%
they're just they're small but that's
okay

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
yeah we have to think a little bit out
 
00:44:38.589 --> 00:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
of the box that all ideas may not be
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
good ones including my own but I want to
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
try to move the needle you know we have
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
to take bites of the Apple um there
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be any one solution I
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
mean maybe we can see if the state can
 
00:44:56.829 --> 00:44:56.839 align:start position:0%
put in something that would give us more
 
00:44:59.309 --> 00:44:59.319 align:start position:0%
f Federal matching dollars I you know
 
00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:02.559 align:start position:0%
that may be a possibility too but we we
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
have to discuss all the ideas to find
 
00:45:05.119 --> 00:45:06.349 align:start position:0%
have to discuss all the ideas to find
the

00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:06.359 --> 00:45:13.109 align:start position:0%
the
solutions

00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
yeah okay any other thoughts on uh
 
00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
Universal designs before we go to the
 
00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:22.589 align:start position:0%
Universal designs before we go to the
next

00:45:22.589 --> 00:45:22.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:26.549 --> 00:45:26.559 align:start position:0%
finding okay um the the next um finding
 
00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
was that um people who receive their
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
income from Social Security Disability
 
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
or supplemental security income do not
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
make enough money to rent market rate
 
00:45:36.549 --> 00:45:36.559 align:start position:0%
Apartments the waiting list for housing
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
Choice vouchers in New Hampshire is 6
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
to8 years currently 6,300 elderly or
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
disabled people in New Hampshire hold
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
vouchers and another 12,000 people are
 
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
on the waiting
 
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
list um so you know we did we did hear
 
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
from some people who were um
 
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
um develop disabilities later in life
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
who were unable to find apartments that
 
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
they could afford because they were no
 
00:46:06.549 --> 00:46:06.559 align:start position:0%
longer able to work and were on
 
00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:09.640 align:start position:0%
disability and had applied for housing
 
00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:12.200 align:start position:0%
Choice vouchers and were not able to
 
00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
secure them and we also heard from New
 
00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing um Finance Authority
 
00:46:17.599 --> 00:46:18.829 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing um Finance Authority
um

00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
that they there aren't enough of them to
 
00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:25.640 align:start position:0%
go around um so do we have any thoughts
 
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
on um what how we might be able to
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
um look into that I
 
00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:34.710 align:start position:0%
um look into that I
[Music]

00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
mean um one person s suggested that the
 
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
state would be able to put money into
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
the um into the voucher account and they
 
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
said in Massachusetts they were doing
 
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
some of that um or you know
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
creating creating you there two kinds of
 
00:46:59.470 --> 00:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
units there's the one that's transver
 
00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:01.640 align:start position:0%
that goes to the individ individual and
 
00:47:03.309 --> 00:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
then they have to find an apartment and
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
then there are the other ones that where
 
00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:07.640 align:start position:0%
the subsidy is tied to the individual
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
unit so you build an apartment building
 
00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
elderly housing or whatever and each one
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
of those units for the people who live
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
there they only need to pay onethird of
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
their income and then the rest of it is
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
paid by a federal um a voucher rent
 
00:47:27.309 --> 00:47:27.319 align:start position:0%
voucher I would say the the first
 
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
problem is that those Social Security
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
checks are not high enough and maybe we
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
make a strong recommendation to our
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
federal delegation that they work on
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
increasing that along with overhaul of
 
00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
the whole funding mechanism that the cap
 
00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.589 align:start position:0%
the whole funding mechanism that the cap
on

00:47:44.589 --> 00:47:44.599 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:47:47.069 --> 00:47:47.079 align:start position:0%
contributions to Social Security is
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
still capped at like 150
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
$130,000 a year and after that you don't
 
00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
contribute more of your income so that
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be lifted
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
so first of
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
all more money into Social
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
Security but I got the impression from
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
um who was it
 
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
um Alyssa that she thought trying to get
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
increases in vouchers for HUD is not
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
happen um and
 
00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
that um a
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
better thing would be increasing the um
 
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
state of um through the real estate
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
transfer tax increasing the funds that
 
00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
go into the state um affordable housing
 
00:48:38.109 --> 00:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
fund so that maybe the state can help
 
00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
directly Finance some new projects that
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities all right Senator I just I
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
want to bring up another um problem so
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
that we will be able to figure out
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
something um we heard a lot of testimony
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
from people who needed procedures in the
 
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.430 align:start position:0%
from people who needed procedures in the
hospital

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:07.190 align:start position:0%
hospital
and

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:10.559 align:start position:0%
they the hospital can't let them go home
 
00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
if they don't have a home to go to or
 
00:49:16.789 --> 00:49:16.799 align:start position:0%
they um are not able to be fit at home
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
and that's keeping beds from being from
 
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
other people who need to be in the
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
hospital so that is another problem that
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to look at they they
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
just can't release somebody when they
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
have nowhere to
 
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
go yeah some of them end up in shelters
 
00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.549 align:start position:0%
go yeah some of them end up in shelters
in

00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester with because they have no
 
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
home to go to so we have we have people
 
00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
that are brought directly from the
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:57.549 --> 00:49:57.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:59.470 --> 00:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
so yeah I
 
00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:03.400 align:start position:0%
I yeah I I agree that that that that is
 
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
um but as far as
 
00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
um specifically that you know that
 
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
people can't afford the market rate
 
00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:16.670 align:start position:0%
people can't afford the market rate
Apartments

00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
Apartments
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
um I mean one thing would be if there is
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
a large project going in anywhere that
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
um we can't really mandate
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
that it's the towns and cities that
 
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:32.200 align:start position:0%
approve those projects um but we could
 
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps recommend or may maybe it is a
 
00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:37.710 align:start position:0%
perhaps recommend or may maybe it is a
state

00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:37.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
um we we
 
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
could move toward requiring a certain
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
percent be set aside for
 
00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
um that are affordable I we're talking
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
there's so much money going into housing
 
00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
in this state the tremendous amount of
 
00:50:57.789 --> 00:50:57.799 align:start position:0%
money I I don't if we can't use some of
 
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
those resources we're really in trouble
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think man you know I like local
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
control I don't think you can mandate
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
but I think you can
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
incentivize um and I don't think that
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
works out too well when you start
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
mandating things I I think we have to
 
00:51:15.549 --> 00:51:15.559 align:start position:0%
find a better a better way to
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
incentivize um maybe in a in a tax
 
00:51:20.789 --> 00:51:20.799 align:start position:0%
credit or something like that rather
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
than more taxing um tax
 
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
credit if if I may I I I do think that
 
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
there are um you know like there are
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
programs where people get you know
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
Federal guaranteed loans or they get tax
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
credits from communities Etc and I don't
 
00:51:41.789 --> 00:51:41.799 align:start position:0%
think there's anything in law that would
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
allow a city or town to say yes we will
 
00:51:48.549 --> 00:51:48.559 align:start position:0%
give you this variance yes we will give
 
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
you this um you know this fiveyear tax
 
00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:53.720 align:start position:0%
abatement but only if you include some
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
affordable units in this you know know
 
00:51:59.309 --> 00:51:59.319 align:start position:0%
50 unit apartment building there's I
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
don't think that that that by law you
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
can can do that
 
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.870 align:start position:0%
can can do that
so

00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
they yeah they have there's some way
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
that it gets done in Manchester they
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
tell us it's impossible because it's it
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
illegal but in do they've been doing it
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
I agree that it's illegal whether or not
 
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
that Dober is doing it that's a question
 
00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:25.240 align:start position:0%
for the courts that
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
um I definitely am
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
not in favor of of suggesting changes to
 
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
to Social Security um however I do think
 
00:52:40.589 --> 00:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
um that the New Hampshire Housing
 
00:52:49.069 --> 00:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
Authority uh five I think it's only $5
 
00:52:51.789 --> 00:52:51.799 align:start position:0%
million that if we want to see more
 
00:52:56.589 --> 00:52:56.599 align:start position:0%
projects being done then
 
00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
then yeah
 
00:53:01.069 --> 00:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
increasing that amount of money from the
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax makes more
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
sense cuz more money means more projects
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
are going to be able to be
 
00:53:11.789 --> 00:53:11.799 align:start position:0%
um you know money is going to be able to
 
00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
be lent out for
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
that um and so I think that's definitely
 
00:53:21.549 --> 00:53:21.559 align:start position:0%
something that should look into um
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
definitely in the next budget budget
 
00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
yeah and and you know I think that that
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
that is really a good idea and I I think
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
um but I I I still
 
00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
feel like maybe providing some kind of a
 
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
bonus from that money to um developers
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
who are willing to put in a unit or two
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
of um Universal Design housing in in a
 
00:54:15.789 --> 00:54:15.799 align:start position:0%
large project you know as an incentive
 
00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:17.480 align:start position:0%
um not as a
 
00:54:21.309 --> 00:54:21.319 align:start position:0%
mandate I definitely liked like yes that
 
00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
idea as far as
 
00:54:27.549 --> 00:54:27.559 align:start position:0%
the if there was some
 
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
if we had some number of like you know
 
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
it's 10% or 15% more um added to the
 
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
project if the state wanted to earmark
 
00:54:39.309 --> 00:54:39.319 align:start position:0%
some some you know money and say like
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
hey we want you to do a program or a
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
pilot program for a couple of years
 
00:54:46.109 --> 00:54:46.119 align:start position:0%
where we're going to you know give you
 
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
25% or whatever if you do a certain
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
amount of the units or maybe we we put
 
00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
you higher up on the list or whatever
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
like you more points as far as you're
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
you know they're trying to get points or
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
whatever to get get higher in the
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
funding that maybe one of those
 
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
categories for points could be the
 
00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
number of units with Universal Design or
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
something like that that's great that's
 
00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:13.480 align:start position:0%
a great idea yeah because um because
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
when we heard from New Hampshire Housing
 
00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
Finance they did say that um all of
 
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
their um they they have a competitive
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
process and it is based on points so you
 
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
know adding
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
um you know for for projects that you
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
know come out of the affordable housing
 
00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:33.990 align:start position:0%
know come out of the affordable housing
um

00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
fund you
 
00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:39.160 align:start position:0%
know I and I I don't even
 
00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
know I'm so so sad you're not going to
 
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
be here um I I wouldn't even know like
 
00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
how to where where would that lever be
 
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
would it be would it be legislative to
 
00:55:57.309 --> 00:55:57.319 align:start position:0%
say that do do we get to say how how the
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
points are awarded in the um affordable
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
housing trust uh
 
00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
process or is that something we would
 
00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
need to do more research on are you
 
00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:09.160 align:start position:0%
saying is that mandated at the federal
 
00:56:11.069 --> 00:56:11.079 align:start position:0%
level and we can't control it because
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
it's t funding it's definit no the New
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Authority is is
 
00:56:16.799 --> 00:56:18.630 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Authority is is
funded

00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
um through the real estate well the the
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
$5 million that we're talking about
 
00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:27.160 align:start position:0%
loaning out um and
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
is comes from our New Hampshire real
 
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax a certain amount of
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
money of that goes to that fund and then
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
the rest goes to our general fund and so
 
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
that's New Hampshire's money and so
 
00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
there the strings are our strings that
 
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
we put on um so I think that it that
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
those rules for New Hampshire housing
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
are probably in rules and would are
 
00:56:53.789 --> 00:56:53.799 align:start position:0%
impact of them can be legislative but
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
generally it's going to be through the
 
00:56:58.270 --> 00:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
rule set setting committee okay um and
 
00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
so I think that working with New
 
00:57:04.029 --> 00:57:04.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing to say like hey we
 
00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
were thinking that this would be
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
good gauge their interests gauge their
 
00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
like is there some hurdles towards that
 
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
and then reaching out to the people on
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
the uh uh the uh rule setting committee
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
and say hey we want we want to implement
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
this how to how do we achieve that I
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
think is the next steps for that yeah
 
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
but I mean I think most of the money
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Housing Authority
 
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
comes from federal funds that $5 million
 
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
is hardly going to build one apartment
 
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
building um that's correct but if if it
 
00:57:40.829 --> 00:57:40.839 align:start position:0%
was a yeah so if there you know if there
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
is a project that's getting money from a
 
00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:46.039 align:start position:0%
a you know a bunch of different
 
00:57:50.589 --> 00:57:50.599 align:start position:0%
buckets um as an incentive you
 
00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
know to get the get some of the money
 
00:57:55.789 --> 00:57:55.799 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Housing Trust
 
00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
because it you know that $5 million as
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
you said would not go very far for one
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
project but as a um you know as were
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
able to get more money put into that
 
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
fund then
 
00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
um then we would have you know more that
 
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
we could uh put toward
 
00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.349 align:start position:0%
we could uh put toward
building

00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
yeah housing for people with
 
00:58:22.319 --> 00:58:24.349 align:start position:0%
yeah housing for people with
disabilities

00:58:24.349 --> 00:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
so I I think another concern that I
 
00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
heard um in our hearings is that there
 
00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
are a lot of buildings that were built
 
00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
um for 30-year plans to provide so many
 
00:58:40.349 --> 00:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
units that are affordable or accept that
 
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
accept vouchers and those are about to
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
expire like a lot of them so there going
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
to be in even more shortage so but
 
00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:51.880 align:start position:0%
probably these buildings after 30 years
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
are going to need major Renovations and
 
00:58:57.029 --> 00:58:57.039 align:start position:0%
they'll be looking for new
 
00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
Capital to do that and if we
 
00:59:00.079 --> 00:59:03.150 align:start position:0%
Capital to do that and if we
can

00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
um also incentivize that they continue
 
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
to to accept vouchers if they want any
 
00:59:10.349 --> 00:59:10.359 align:start position:0%
funding to do
 
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
that um rather than have them all
 
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:37.799 align:start position:0%
and you know I I I still think it would
 
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
be a good idea to reach out to the
 
00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
members of the federal um delegation I
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
mean there
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
um you know increasing the amounts we
 
00:59:56.029 --> 00:59:56.039 align:start position:0%
you know we but but also specific
 
00:59:58.510 --> 00:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
specifically related to housing and
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of things like the the
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
fair claw Amendment which forbids
 
01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
construction of new like housing
 
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
projects um that are owned by the local
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
Housing Authority
 
01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
like when in you know in Manchester we
 
01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
have things like the uh Elmwood Gardens
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
and the rock rimen project Etc and um
 
01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.150 align:start position:0%
and the rock rimen project Etc and um
they're

01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
um they're not allowed to build that
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
kind of project anymore because of the
 
01:00:37.029 --> 01:00:37.039 align:start position:0%
fair claw Amendment because they moved
 
01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
away from doing that specifically in
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
building uh affordable housing to the
 
01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
voucher system where they could um put
 
01:00:49.870 --> 01:00:49.880 align:start position:0%
th those funds into the private
 
01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
sector so I you know I I still think
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
that it would be worth talking to them
 
01:00:57.309 --> 01:00:57.319 align:start position:0%
and uh seeing if there's because there
 
01:00:59.549 --> 01:00:59.559 align:start position:0%
you know and the other thing is that we
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
think we can change the rules here in um
 
01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so that we can allow for
 
01:01:09.309 --> 01:01:09.319 align:start position:0%
more flexibility in housing people with
 
01:01:13.390 --> 01:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
disabilities but HUD may think otherwise
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
and I think having the federal
 
01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:19.960 align:start position:0%
delegation on our side um to maybe
 
01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
um advocate for um our people um in New
 
01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um might be worth doing
 
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
um just because it's it's a it's a
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
potential barrier to doing what we're
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
hoping to do go ahead if we if you were
 
01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
to say something like we recommend to
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
the federal delegation that they work
 
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839 align:start position:0%
with HUD to allow more flexibility in
 
01:01:51.269 --> 01:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
the administration of the
 
01:01:55.029 --> 01:01:55.039 align:start position:0%
um from our local housing authority to
 
01:01:58.190 --> 01:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
suit the needs of our state more
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
particularly then I think
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's that
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
um is definitely you know and and also
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
doing um just
 
01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:13.240 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever that they can do at
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
the federal level obviously they're
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
they're working at a different you know
 
01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
different projects but anything that
 
01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
that could possibly bring more
 
01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
options um for housing to people in
 
01:02:30.269 --> 01:02:30.279 align:start position:0%
general and people specifically with
 
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities than that that would be a
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
help because it's not it's not something
 
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
that the the the state is going to be
 
01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:44.839 align:start position:0%
completely uh you know solve on its own
 
01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:47.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to need you know individuals
 
01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:49.190 align:start position:0%
we're going to need you know individuals
Building

01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
Building
 
01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
Homes municipalities getting out of the
 
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
way so that they can build homes um you
 
01:02:57.870 --> 01:02:57.880 align:start position:0%
know people at the H you know the
 
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
federal issue also but it's it's at all
 
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
levels and and um the biggest impact
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
that we have is obviously on the state
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
level but we need those other people to
 
01:03:12.269 --> 01:03:12.279 align:start position:0%
partner with us I guess in solving the
 
01:03:12.279 --> 01:03:13.870 align:start position:0%
partner with us I guess in solving the
the

01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
issue well in and I put down additional
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
housing vouchers which doesn't seem to
 
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
be like we have an appetite for that but
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
how about just additional resources
 
01:03:26.589 --> 01:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
because that could be
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
a variety of
 
01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:35.710 align:start position:0%
a variety of
things

01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
right okay all right
 
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:49.240 align:start position:0%
um the the last thing that we heard
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
about last week was um a New Hampshire
 
01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid housing benefit um program
 
01:03:59.789 --> 01:03:59.799 align:start position:0%
that was signed into law in 2022 and has
 
01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
yet to be
 
01:04:03.269 --> 01:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
implemented that was what Alyssa was
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
talking about that um there had been um
 
01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
a law that was passed in the budget and
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
um and and it has hasn't been
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
implemented yet so it was signed in 2022
 
01:04:20.269 --> 01:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
so I want to look into that I think
 
01:04:22.109 --> 01:04:22.119 align:start position:0%
that's a recommendation to look into
 
01:04:25.269 --> 01:04:25.279 align:start position:0%
that um law and why um what what's a
 
01:04:27.269 --> 01:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
hold up
 
01:04:30.269 --> 01:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
Y is everyone because you know that that
 
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
that's for um Supportive Housing and um
 
01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
that would be that would be a huge
 
01:04:42.269 --> 01:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
um a huge Boon to the people who are you
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
know trying to provide Supportive
 
01:04:54.029 --> 01:04:54.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
people okay the last thing that I have
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
on here that we learned about was the
 
01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
state's stable savings program that
 
01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
allows people who receive benefits to
 
01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
save money without losing benefits and
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
that this is a resource that can be used
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
to pay for housing whether rented or
 
01:05:09.359 --> 01:05:11.309 align:start position:0%
to pay for housing whether rented or
purchased

01:05:11.309 --> 01:05:11.319 align:start position:0%
purchased
 
01:05:14.589 --> 01:05:14.599 align:start position:0%
um does anyone have any recommendations
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
about what we can do with that knowledge
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
to help move
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
the move the process of finding safe
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
affordable and appropriate housing for
 
01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
people with disabil
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
abilities I for me um I've been thinking
 
01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:34.839 align:start position:0%
that about that a little bit um like my
 
01:05:34.839 --> 01:05:35.789 align:start position:0%
that about that a little bit um like my
my

01:05:35.789 --> 01:05:35.799 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
stepdaughter who has Down
 
01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:41.720 align:start position:0%
syndrome um and has been in a very
 
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
stable um Home Care providership
 
01:05:49.549 --> 01:05:49.559 align:start position:0%
administered um by one of the area
 
01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
agencies and you know has um Medicare so
 
01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
her housing and her health care are
 
01:05:58.589 --> 01:05:58.599 align:start position:0%
taken care of and also the housing
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
includes most of her
 
01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:03.640 align:start position:0%
food since um the pandemic she has been
 
01:06:05.789 --> 01:06:05.799 align:start position:0%
making more money in her part-time job
 
01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
and she is actually saving
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
money which is
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
great though um as a family we sort of
 
01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
save that money for her okay could be in
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
a sable account but there are a lot of
 
01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.029 align:start position:0%
a sable account but there are a lot of
people

01:06:22.029 --> 01:06:22.039 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
who on are on disability that became
 
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
disabled later they weren't born with
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
the disability they became disabled that
 
01:06:34.269 --> 01:06:34.279 align:start position:0%
aren't eligible for that and also as we
 
01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
heard from several
 
01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:39.640 align:start position:0%
people they just barely make ends eat
 
01:06:42.109 --> 01:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
it's not possible meat it's not possible
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
for them to save money period when they
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
can barely pay for their housing and
 
01:06:46.559 --> 01:06:47.269 align:start position:0%
can barely pay for their housing and
their

01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
food as it is there's nothing left over
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
so I don't know
 
01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
how expanding this prr program would
 
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
help that population who are the ones Mo
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
really struggling right
 
01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:07.480 align:start position:0%
now yeah well one of the things that um
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
that um they did say was that the
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
um you know people who have set up
 
01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
trusts for um their disabled children um
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
can transfer that money from the trust
 
01:07:26.349 --> 01:07:26.359 align:start position:0%
to this stable account and then have it
 
01:07:30.910 --> 01:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
and use it for use it for
 
01:07:33.789 --> 01:07:33.799 align:start position:0%
housing so it's you know kind of a stop
 
01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
Gap in between and I you know but if if
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
like in in Eliza's case she doesn't need
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
the money for housing the money for
 
01:07:48.829 --> 01:07:48.839 align:start position:0%
housing comes from um you know all over
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
social security goes to the state
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
agency and they have they use other
 
01:07:54.799 --> 01:07:57.789 align:start position:0%
agency and they have they use other
resources

01:07:57.789 --> 01:07:57.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:59.910 --> 01:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
um and I don't fully understand it I you
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
know I don't think it's a Medicare
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
waiver Medicaid waiver but
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
possibly so and what I'm saying is she
 
01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't need a stable account to pay for
 
01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
her housing that's taken care of it can
 
01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.870 align:start position:0%
her housing that's taken care of it can
so

01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
um it's not benefiting a certain
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
population that needs the money to pay
 
01:08:28.030 --> 01:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
for rent like many of the people um that
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
about that were struggling to pay rent
 
01:08:36.510 --> 01:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
with their fairly recent onset
 
01:08:38.829 --> 01:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
disability would not be eligible for
 
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
this anyway and they wouldn't have any
 
01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
extra money to put into it well I I
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
think if I may one of the um one of the
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
concerns that we've heard an awful lot
 
01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
from parents of adults with disability
 
01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
is what happens to their children after
 
01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
after they're gone you know they're
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
living at home with their parents so um
 
01:09:03.550 --> 01:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
in that case there wouldn't be anybody
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
to manage that money for them I mean you
 
01:09:10.749 --> 01:09:10.759 align:start position:0%
the family if the family was no longer
 
01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
there to manage the money and hold the
 
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
account for that person like when I hate
 
01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
to say this but when you and your
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
husband are gone you know who who's
 
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
going to manage Eliza's account will she
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
be able to have a savings account with
 
01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
any more than $2,000 in it if she wants
 
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
to you know buy stuff well you set it up
 
01:09:36.789 --> 01:09:36.799 align:start position:0%
and you know a like like with Social
 
01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
Security you have a rep pay that manages
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
account and then she would have someone
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
else like her sister but the idea of
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
having Eliza in a St stable home care
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
providership you hope that the area
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
agency will continue to look out for her
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
interest she will continue to have an
 
01:09:57.870 --> 01:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
independent case manager looking out for
 
01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:58.669 align:start position:0%
independent case manager looking out for
her

01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
her
 
01:10:02.189 --> 01:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
interest but like the stable program can
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
have the advantage of other family
 
01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
members contributing to it if As Long As
 
01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
I understood that
 
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
correctly um but again there will be a
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
lot of people that don't have the family
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
support that are going to contribute
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
independently to their stable account to
 
01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
out all right so well
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
there was one other suggestion I heard a
 
01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
few times um is that there needs to be
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
someone at the
 
01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
state either in um The Bureau Bureau of
 
01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
Developmental Disabilities or somewhere
 
01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
else at
 
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
DHHS whose specific job it is to help
 
01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:49.960 align:start position:0%
these families that are trying to set up
 
01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
new housing
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
um facilities
 
01:10:57.149 --> 01:10:57.159 align:start position:0%
that they these families have felt
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
they're all on their own trying to
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
figure it out they don't know who to
 
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
call and you know to sort of set up one
 
01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
person and and hopefully you could do it
 
01:11:09.149 --> 01:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
without having to create a new
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
position but say to um Health and Human
 
01:11:17.229 --> 01:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
Services or
 
01:11:20.189 --> 01:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
BDS let's appoint someone whose job it
 
01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
is that's going to help um families that
 
01:11:26.189 --> 01:11:26.199 align:start position:0%
are trying to create new housing Sy
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
situations to redefine the job
 
01:11:32.189 --> 01:11:32.199 align:start position:0%
definition and then make that clearly
 
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
known across the community that they're
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:41.629 --> 01:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
help Senator I think in the uh you've
 
01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:43.400 align:start position:0%
covered this very well by the way thank
 
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
you for doing that for the preliminary
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
report and I just think we should also
 
01:11:51.790 --> 01:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
put in there that we need to sit down um
 
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
not individually but we have to have the
 
01:11:56.189 --> 01:11:56.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire builders
 
01:11:56.199 --> 01:11:56.950 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire builders
the

01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
developers the uh invest New Hampshire
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
um the medical uh Hospital Association
 
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
director and we should have them all at
 
01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
once and oh and the real estate people
 
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
because all this impacts everybody and
 
01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
try to get everybody coming together for
 
01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
a solution where everybody's on
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
board um so that we're not trying to do
 
01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:25.719 align:start position:0%
one thing and then then you get this
 
01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
other entity that objects and then we
 
01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
spin our Wheels I think if we can give
 
01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
everybody a seat at the table that we
 
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
could probably come up with something
 
01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:36.990 align:start position:0%
could probably come up with something
that's

01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
doable and that might be a good addition
 
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
to the report because it shows what
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do going
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
forward all right so so are you looking
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
at possibly creating a commission
 
01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
commiss that sounds like a commission it
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
does I
 
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
just I'm just trying to think about the
 
01:13:00.189 --> 01:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
best way to move
 
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
forward yeah I well I'm I'm I'm open to
 
01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
making the recommendation that you know
 
01:13:10.629 --> 01:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
we appoint a commission um I don't know
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
how to move forward without having all
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
these people have a seat at the table
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
but maybe someone else has an idea but
 
01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
they all need to be part of this process
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
yeah is there a a commission to look at
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
generally other than the special
 
01:13:32.350 --> 01:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
committee that we
 
01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
have the
 
01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
legislature I don't believe so he
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative yella is on that study
 
01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
committee or that committee
 
01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
no I don't believe that there is a
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
commission specifically about
 
01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.470 align:start position:0%
commission specifically about
housing

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:13:55.229 --> 01:13:55.239 align:start position:0%
um as far as I know I don't think I
 
01:13:58.990 --> 01:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
don't know that there is I I I wonder if
 
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
like in
 
01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:04.280 align:start position:0%
the maybe in
 
01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:09.590 align:start position:0%
the maybe in
the

01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
um you know resource business and
 
01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
resources or Department that the state
 
01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
has if they've got people that are
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the housing situation because
 
01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
that the lack of housing has had such a
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
significant impact on the ability to
 
01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
attract and r workers and and build
 
01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
businesses so I'm wondering if there's
 
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
something in there but again you know
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
um the agenda you know would be
 
01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
different than it would be um where
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
you're looking at people with
 
01:14:56.629 --> 01:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
disabilities ities and significant you
 
01:14:58.350 --> 01:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
know health issues
 
01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
and needs that are um you know um needs
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
for support that they they probably
 
01:15:11.950 --> 01:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even think about so I you know
 
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm open to putting that
 
01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation in there no you know
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
there's no saying
 
01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
that just because we put it in our
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations it doesn't mean it's
 
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
going to happen right that's right but
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
if we don't have all those people on
 
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
board to come to the table I don't know
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
how we can have the most impactful
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
solution yeah I I agree I think it seems
 
01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
like a good idea um
 
01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
does I mean I think that in some sense
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know a special committee on housing
 
01:15:49.830 --> 01:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
creates a a study committee that then
 
01:15:52.350 --> 01:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
creates a commission like I feel like
 
01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:55.719 align:start position:0%
that some point there's there we're kind
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
of like chasing our tail but yes I get
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not opposed to it I just I just
 
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
think that it's
 
01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
um it could have been like you know
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
those Representatives could have been on
 
01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:12.280 align:start position:0%
on the study committee right it it could
 
01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
have been um like would they have to
 
01:16:19.229 --> 01:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
start all over again and listen to all
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
of the same testimony all over again to
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
just to to get back up to speed of where
 
01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
or are you saying like here's a
 
01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
commission on a specific Focus that we
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
have identified based on listening to
 
01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
all of the testimony we want to you know
 
01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
fix uh a commission on on the you know a
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
two-year commission or a four-year
 
01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
Commission on on fixing the the the
 
01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
impact of uh The Lure and certification
 
01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
process and get those stakeholders that
 
01:16:55.470 --> 01:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
are trying to create them and DHHS and
 
01:16:57.390 --> 01:16:57.400 align:start position:0%
and legislatur is all in the same room
 
01:16:59.110 --> 01:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
and say we're going to fix this problem
 
01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
and make it easier for you to create
 
01:17:04.669 --> 01:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
housing for these people right or um or
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
are you just going to be like okay I
 
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
want I want you guys all in a room and I
 
01:17:09.310 --> 01:17:09.320 align:start position:0%
want you to fix housing for disabled
 
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
people and that that's essentially the
 
01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
same as this committee right well my
 
01:17:17.070 --> 01:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
thought was that we we have subsequent
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
meetings that we invite them and ask
 
01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
them to come so that we can pick their
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
brains and
 
01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
get them on board with suggestions that
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't that the real estate people or
 
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
the new Hing Hampshire Authority or the
 
01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
developers don't object when we actually
 
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
make legislation that they got a seat at
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
the table I wasn't thinking of another
 
01:17:42.149 --> 01:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
committee but inviting them where they
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
can come multiple times to be a part of
 
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
this so that they're not negatively
 
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
impacted but want to find Solutions over
 
01:17:52.629 --> 01:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
the next year what what about a a a bill
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
to uh add them to this committee
 
01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I yeah I think like I think that
 
01:18:01.709 --> 01:18:01.719 align:start position:0%
that might be the a good idea well I
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
think it's a good idea but I think the
 
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
reason that you know we're um you know
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
as as as a rookie legislator and as
 
01:18:13.470 --> 01:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
someone who um has never done this
 
01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
before um the the rules and the
 
01:18:19.870 --> 01:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
requirements for a legislatively
 
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
appointed study committee limit the you
 
01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
know the level of of uh conversation
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
that can take place and and I recall a
 
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks ago when um they were
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
here from the New Hampshire Housing
 
01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority that they um sought
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
out the opportunity to have offline
 
01:18:43.229 --> 01:18:43.239 align:start position:0%
conversations about some of the issues
 
01:18:47.709 --> 01:18:47.719 align:start position:0%
that we brought up with them so I'm um I
 
01:18:51.070 --> 01:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
I don't think that I don't know that in
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
this structure that we can have that
 
01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
kind of back and forth that um you would
 
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
like to um that you think well and and I
 
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
believe are are necessary in order to
 
01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
move the process forward so you know I
 
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
think going forward what I was looking
 
01:19:11.550 --> 01:19:11.560 align:start position:0%
at is having the conversations you know
 
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
going to DH HS or BDS and sitting down
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
with them and saying okay what do you
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
think and then maybe talking to somebody
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
in HUD and you know just trying to focus
 
01:19:27.149 --> 01:19:27.159 align:start position:0%
in on these uh little things but um you
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
know these individual issues and
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
problems but yeah I agree with you that
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know this the
 
01:19:37.870 --> 01:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
whole it's it's a it's a big problem
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
with a lot of moving parts
 
01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
that not including people could create
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences and I think
 
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
that's what we need to avoid that's what
 
01:19:53.709 --> 01:19:53.719 align:start position:0%
I was yes trying to get at is that so
 
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
and and I don't know commissions operate
 
01:19:59.229 --> 01:19:59.239 align:start position:0%
I've never been on one oh I was on one
 
01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
before I was even in in the legislature
 
01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
I was appointed by the governor um
 
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
so uh and it there's people from all
 
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
different backgrounds that come and then
 
01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
you meet it was during covid so we were
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
zooming but um and then same thing you
 
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
do your reports and recommendations are
 
01:20:23.189 --> 01:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
made and then legislation came out of
 
01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
it and it was year long yeah but I just
 
01:20:30.189 --> 01:20:30.199 align:start position:0%
feel we need more of those
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
experts and we want them to all be on
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
board and on the same
 
01:20:37.709 --> 01:20:37.719 align:start position:0%
page I'm just thinking out loud because
 
01:20:39.870 --> 01:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
this is the time that we can you know
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
well you know one thing that we can do
 
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
and putting forward our recommendation
 
01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
is to say that we need to hear from more
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
of the stakeholders and then you know
 
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
list the ones that you have mentioned
 
01:20:59.870 --> 01:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
about um how you know we want to um we
 
01:21:03.709 --> 01:21:03.719 align:start position:0%
want to engage with them and not
 
01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily figure out um you know it
 
01:21:09.229 --> 01:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
might not be in this environment it
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
might be some I and and I you know
 
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
Freedom of Information laws and all that
 
01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff I don't know if more than
 
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
more than two of us from this committee
 
01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
are allowed to go talk to um somebody
 
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
from the hospital Association um and
 
01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
have and have a private conversation I
 
01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
mean cuz then we would we would have a
 
01:21:33.149 --> 01:21:33.159 align:start position:0%
quarum and then you know then everything
 
01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
would have to be
 
01:21:37.870 --> 01:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
public I just and you know and you know
 
01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
basically we we want to get the
 
01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
information and get the and build the
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
relationships um but you know I and and
 
01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
I I don't you know
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
I I'm not 100% sure that this setup is
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
is the best way to do that what about if
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
we sent an email to all of those I
 
01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
listed tell them we're we're inviting
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
your input to have a seat at the table
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
we are tasked with finding solutions to
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
these things you are an important part
 
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
of this process please give input okay
 
01:22:16.270 --> 01:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
maybe that would be a way to get it at
 
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
least on paper um and see what they say
 
01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
and and it can kind of get everybody all
 
01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
at once one email to all the whole list
 
01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
of of all of them Real Estate
 
01:22:29.070 --> 01:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
Association the New Hampshire Builders
 
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
Association the hospital Association the
 
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
developers um and New Hampshire Housing
 
01:22:36.669 --> 01:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
Authority and say this is what we're
 
01:22:39.790 --> 01:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
tasked with this impacts you we want
 
01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:41.149 align:start position:0%
tasked with this impacts you we want
your

01:22:41.149 --> 01:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
input that's I wonder um if we could set
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
up like a
 
01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
longer Workshop to that effect um
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
working group I think a working group
 
01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
but even to have um
 
01:22:56.830 --> 01:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
you know if there's any
 
01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:58.790 align:start position:0%
you know if there's any
funding

01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
um available to like hire up someone to
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
help facilitate this I mean it's a lot
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
for us volunteer
 
01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:12.470 align:start position:0%
for us volunteer
legislators

01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
to um to organize an event that could be
 
01:23:18.430 --> 01:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
really productive and bring everyone
 
01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
together rather than you know just
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
having these meetings at this in the
 
01:23:25.629 --> 01:23:25.639 align:start position:0%
lob um
 
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
um as an
 
01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
idea um I'm I'm also wondering if there
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
would be a potential to set up some sort
 
01:23:38.189 --> 01:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
of um well I'm going to call it a public
 
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
private partnership where um that we're
 
01:23:47.149 --> 01:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
we're at the table but we're not
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily the
 
01:23:51.629 --> 01:23:51.639 align:start position:0%
conveners yes that's sort of what I was
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
saying so is that possible so I think
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
um some housing related um conferences
 
01:24:10.990 --> 01:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that that are especially
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
done by The Institute for politics or
 
01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
something at St anom like they have
 
01:24:21.950 --> 01:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
stuff um as far as like people from kind
 
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
of that all kind of come together on
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
specific day and talk about like what's
 
01:24:29.310 --> 01:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
going on maybe they might be interested
 
01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:30.669 align:start position:0%
going on maybe they might be interested
in

01:24:30.669 --> 01:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:24:34.830 --> 01:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
doing something like that for on this
 
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
topic as far as that where they bring
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
all the people together and see like hey
 
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
the these are our problems these are our
 
01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
Solutions what are your thoughts kind of
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
a thing um and then if we just
 
01:24:52.229 --> 01:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
attended as and and hear their thoughts
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
then then that would be way that you
 
01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.310 align:start position:0%
then then that would be way that you
could

01:24:57.310 --> 01:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
achieve that what you're think yeah yeah
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
the I believe the program that you're
 
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
talking about is the housing we need
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
project at the business and ethics
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
Institute which I think they've changed
 
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
their name but I've actually attended a
 
01:25:19.149 --> 01:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
couple of those um yes me too yeah I but
 
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I was also when I looked up um the
 
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
woman who came from The Institute for
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
Disabilities at
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
UNH I looked I looked her up on their
 
01:25:37.629 --> 01:25:37.639 align:start position:0%
website and they have a huge staff of
 
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
people um I mean that's a tremendous
 
01:25:43.109 --> 01:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
amount of resources that we could
 
01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:46.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully put to work on this problem
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
that you know that's there was that's
 
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
what they're paid to do could we not you
 
01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
know bring them to the table to help
 
01:25:58.350 --> 01:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
organize a symposium or maybe even the
 
01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Builders Association
 
01:26:03.149 --> 01:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
they're always hosting things y I think
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
there's potential but we do need all
 
01:26:09.390 --> 01:26:09.400 align:start position:0%
that input right that to we we just do I
 
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
mean on hindsight I do wish we had
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
appointed uh people with those
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
qualifications onto this
 
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
too y right but then it wouldn't be a
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
study committee it would be a
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
yeah but all right well you know well
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
just this we're imaginative and we are
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
we're talking we're thinking out loud
 
01:26:35.310 --> 01:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that all of that sounds
 
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
like a a good idea um again you know we
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm trying to figure out how
 
01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
because the institute on disabilities is
 
01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
you know part of the I think they're
 
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
part of the University system
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
so can we um again you know would it be
 
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
a mandate if we put in our our
 
01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations I I don't know well we
 
01:27:03.669 --> 01:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
can't force people to I wouldn't yeah I
 
01:27:05.310 --> 01:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to and I wouldn't want you
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
know if they want to I wouldn't want to
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
try to force them to to take this on if
 
01:27:11.709 --> 01:27:11.719 align:start position:0%
it's not something they want to do but I
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
think we need to investigate the
 
01:27:15.510 --> 01:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
possibility of
 
01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
having some organization that you know
 
01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
is specific to um um helping people with
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
disabil ities to
 
01:27:30.229 --> 01:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
um possibly be the convenor and help
 
01:27:32.830 --> 01:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
bring everyone together in an
 
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
environment where um there is um is
 
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
parity between the people who are who
 
01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
are interacting because I mean this is
 
01:27:45.310 --> 01:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
a a convivial kind of setup here I I
 
01:27:53.590 --> 01:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
also think that if you explain to these
 
01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:54.910 align:start position:0%
also think that if you explain to these
entities

01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:27:57.390 --> 01:27:57.400 align:start position:0%
that we're going to do some legislation
 
01:27:59.310 --> 01:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
and it's going to impact you and your
 
01:28:01.149 --> 01:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
business we're offering you a seat at
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
the table to help with these Solutions I
 
01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
think if they realize that that they're
 
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
going to be a willing
 
01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
partner I think that's a great
 
01:28:16.270 --> 01:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
idea okay all right so I um have been
 
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
writing furiously I probably should have
 
01:28:20.189 --> 01:28:20.199 align:start position:0%
been typing this into the notes that I
 
01:28:22.149 --> 01:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
had in there but I've been typing a lot
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
so yeah thank you so much
 
01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
um so okay
 
01:28:31.470 --> 01:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
so all right that that all okay is is
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
there anything else that um we would
 
01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
like to
 
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
um like to include either as um findings
 
01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:43.400 align:start position:0%
or recommendations I will be hoping I
 
01:28:46.590 --> 01:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
will be this is due on the 1 of November
 
01:28:49.109 --> 01:28:49.119 align:start position:0%
so I would think I've been thinking a
 
01:28:49.119 --> 01:28:50.669 align:start position:0%
so I would think I've been thinking a
lot

01:28:50.669 --> 01:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
lot
 
01:28:50.679 --> 01:28:52.430 align:start position:0%
lot
about

01:28:52.430 --> 01:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:28:56.990 --> 01:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
um the situation again with people who
 
01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.030 align:start position:0%
um the situation again with people who
become

01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
become
 
01:29:03.709 --> 01:29:03.719 align:start position:0%
disabled um and they are in some of the
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
toughest situations
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
because in order to get help for their
 
01:29:12.189 --> 01:29:12.199 align:start position:0%
serious medical
 
01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
condition they're best off uh if and
 
01:29:17.229 --> 01:29:17.239 align:start position:0%
they they can't work like they used to
 
01:29:20.510 --> 01:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
work so they don't have Private health
 
01:29:22.510 --> 01:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
insurance from their
 
01:29:25.390 --> 01:29:25.400 align:start position:0%
job um if just on
 
01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:27.719 align:start position:0%
Medicaid they can't go to just any
 
01:29:30.830 --> 01:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
doctor because most private practices
 
01:29:33.189 --> 01:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
don't take Medicaid they can go to the
 
01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
ER and maybe a community health center
 
01:29:38.229 --> 01:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
and that's about it so their best bet is
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
to get
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
on apply for disability then they get on
 
01:29:47.709 --> 01:29:47.719 align:start position:0%
Medicare but it takes on average seven
 
01:29:51.709 --> 01:29:51.719 align:start position:0%
years to get that disability approved so
 
01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
you're stuck for seven years and but
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
then when you get it you can't
 
01:30:01.390 --> 01:30:01.400 align:start position:0%
work so because most
 
01:30:04.109 --> 01:30:04.119 align:start position:0%
people would probably prefer to work and
 
01:30:06.430 --> 01:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
they make a little more money without
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
losing that health insurance which in
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
for people with
 
01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities it's
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
Medicare um so they're they're really
 
01:30:19.109 --> 01:30:19.119 align:start position:0%
stuck so it you know I don't think we
 
01:30:23.310 --> 01:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
can ignore some of these big S systemic
 
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
problems that come from the way Social
 
01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
Security and
 
01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
Medicare um is mandated at the federal
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
level it has a tremendous impact on
 
01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:36.310 align:start position:0%
level it has a tremendous impact on
people's

01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
people's
 
01:30:38.590 --> 01:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
resources and you know and I think we've
 
01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
heard so many situations
 
01:30:43.390 --> 01:30:43.400 align:start position:0%
where if they have a disability and
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
they're lucky enough to get on Medicare
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
then they're sort of stuck in poverty
 
01:30:50.109 --> 01:30:50.119 align:start position:0%
and they don't have enough money to pay
 
01:30:53.070 --> 01:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
rent yes Senator I hear what you're
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
saying and concur by what we've heard in
 
01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
this room but we have to remember one
 
01:30:59.950 --> 01:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
thing as much as we would love to fix
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
all these problems this committee is
 
01:31:05.310 --> 01:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
tasked with to study the impact of
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
housing crisis on people with
 
01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities so we have to stay focused
 
01:31:12.109 --> 01:31:12.119 align:start position:0%
on that even though we it'd be great to
 
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
fix everything because then we may not
 
01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
get this fixed like I think we have to
 
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
really focus on exactly what we're task
 
01:31:20.830 --> 01:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
with right but I think that could be
 
01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
included as a
 
01:31:25.149 --> 01:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
finding that contributes to why people
 
01:31:27.109 --> 01:31:27.119 align:start position:0%
are in the situation they're in yeah as
 
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
a they they they have a disability and
 
01:31:33.109 --> 01:31:33.119 align:start position:0%
they can't work or they lose their
 
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
health insurance and that is a
 
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
significant reason why they're in they
 
01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
don't have enough money to pay market
 
01:31:41.639 --> 01:31:42.790 align:start position:0%
