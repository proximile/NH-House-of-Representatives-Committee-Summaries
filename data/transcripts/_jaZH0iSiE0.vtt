division three work session on what is
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 239 the title is an act
 
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
relative to the use of harm reduction
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
services to treat alcohol and other
 
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:35.700 align:start position:0%
substance misuse
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
representative Jess Edwards the chair of
 
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
this division is unexpectedly able to be
 
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
here today however I will chair this
 
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
work session and information session my
 
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
name is representative Maureen Mooney
 
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
from the town of Merrimack Vice chair of
 
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
this division
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
so we have with us today members of
 
00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
division three as well as those who have
 
00:08:59.329 --> 00:08:59.339 align:start position:0%
worked as I understand it very
 
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
thoroughly on House Bill 239 and the
 
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
hope today is to maybe have a maximum of
 
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
a 90-minute or so discussion and
 
00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:12.140 align:start position:0%
information sharing related to the bill
 
00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:14.700 align:start position:0%
and then we'll pick it up again in
 
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
September for some decisions to be made
 
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
so with that I understand with us today
 
00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
is Senator Waters as well as
 
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel representative
 
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.130 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel representative
Shapiro

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:28.140 align:start position:0%
Shapiro
 
00:09:30.889 --> 00:09:30.899 align:start position:0%
former representative Solway former
 
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry
 
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.009 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry
Hannon

00:09:34.009 --> 00:09:34.019 align:start position:0%
Hannon
 
00:09:34.019 --> 00:09:35.509 align:start position:0%
Hannon
Hannon

00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
Hannon
 
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:39.180 align:start position:0%
today who have worked extensively on
 
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:44.540 align:start position:0%
and so with that why don't we start by
 
00:09:47.329 --> 00:09:47.339 align:start position:0%
walking through it if the committee
 
00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
members are amenable to that and either
 
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters or representative Nagel I
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
think could probably take that on if
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
you're amenable to starting at that
 
00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
point thank you well thanks so much
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney and uh nice to see
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
all the fellow colleagues and we're
 
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
almost done aren't we you know Thursday
 
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
and I tell you what a session it's been
 
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
but um it's nice to have a chance to to
 
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:14.220 align:start position:0%
revisit this before we take our summer
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
break and I I'm sorry uh the
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards is not here and
 
00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:22.519 align:start position:0%
wish him uh well and we had had a zoom
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
webinar or conference or call together a
 
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
few days ago to go over a lot of the
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
issues that emerged during the finance
 
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
three uh hearing on the bill and the
 
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
questions as an excellent session
 
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
um with some of the harm reduction
 
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
Coalition folks and um from that I think
 
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
we've developed some approaches and some
 
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
some thoughts and also
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
um I believe that representative Edwards
 
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
and I will visit one of the syringe
 
00:10:52.009 --> 00:10:52.019 align:start position:0%
exchange sites in Manchester together so
 
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
have a have a chance to look a little
 
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
bit more about what we're talking about
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
when we talk about harm reduction and I
 
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
um would like to say that the folks
 
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
would be happy for any other
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative who wants to you know
 
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
just go out in the field and see how how
 
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
harm reduction actually works you'd be
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
more than welcome and that can be set up
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
and then um very timely really kind of
 
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
hot off the press uh the project that
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
Carrie Nolte and others have been doing
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
to try to provide some educational
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
materials and and guide particularly for
 
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
policy makers and uh you have before you
 
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
drafted that report which they were
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
willing to share a little a little early
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
um and uh they uh really some are here
 
00:11:35.449 --> 00:11:35.459 align:start position:0%
today but they're just done
 
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
extraordinary working trying to lay out
 
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
uh information on this topic and I think
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
particularly for finance three you know
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
you're not HHS and uh you know how it is
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
on legislators such as myself who I've
 
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
done a Governor's commission and I've
 
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519 align:start position:0%
been involved with these things for for
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
decades and you know how we all focus
 
00:11:55.009 --> 00:11:55.019 align:start position:0%
and it's like oh yeah maybe other people
 
00:11:56.569 --> 00:11:56.579 align:start position:0%
in the world don't understand what I'm
 
00:11:58.490 --> 00:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
talking what we're talking about and so
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
I I hope you will find that information
 
00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:03.180 align:start position:0%
helpful and um so Madam Vice chair
 
00:12:05.329 --> 00:12:05.339 align:start position:0%
without kind of going into too much
 
00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:06.779 align:start position:0%
detail because I've been before you
 
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
before let me just very briefly go over
 
00:12:12.009 --> 00:12:12.019 align:start position:0%
the the sections of the bill and perhaps
 
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
towards the end it would be better if
 
00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel came forward
 
00:12:17.569 --> 00:12:17.579 align:start position:0%
because he worked on a definitional
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
materials at the at the end um and then
 
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
I really would just like to see what
 
00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:24.779 align:start position:0%
kind of questions that you may have
 
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
um to set up whatever kind of work will
 
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
continue in September so thank you I
 
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
will do that if that's okay Senator
 
00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:32.519 align:start position:0%
would you like the questions as you
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
speak or at the end anything you want to
 
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
do anytime at all great for anyone here
 
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
at the table thank you
 
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
so I will kind of Go part by part
 
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
um and let me just by way of background
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
say that I am on the governor's
 
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
commission and Alcohol and Other Drugs
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
worked with Senator Forester in
 
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
particular about a decade ago in
 
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
revising that commission and its Mission
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
and um over the last uh two years the
 
00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
commission has developed a new strategic
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
plan and you can find that online at on
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
the HHS website for the commission and
 
00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:05.700 align:start position:0%
really a very thorough process and
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
see what the evolving area was and you
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
know the the governor set up the
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
doorways program Federal money has come
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
in a lot has gone on and the Strategic
 
00:13:17.569 --> 00:13:17.579 align:start position:0%
plan reflected that and in particular it
 
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
identified a new task force area
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
on harm reduction
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
and recognizing that that was becoming a
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
kind of a catch-all term for the things
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
that you try to do to prevent disease uh
 
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
and to deal with the health impacts of
 
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:38.060 align:start position:0%
folks who have substance misuse disorder
 
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
this can you know the prevention here on
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
harm reduction you know let's continue
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
to reduce HIV infection
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
let's see if we can you know try to
 
00:13:50.569 --> 00:13:50.579 align:start position:0%
reduce hep C
 
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
um let's see if we can try to reduce
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
infections that you know kind of mean
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
heart heart valve Replacements
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
um all the other kinds of of health
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
effects wound treatment
 
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
um now a lot of this has circled around
 
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
um needle exchange which uh working with
 
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
Senator gray and representative Hanner
 
00:14:12.889 --> 00:14:12.899 align:start position:0%
who got that one of the people got that
 
00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519 align:start position:0%
started a number of years ago that's
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
what you know a 10 cent syringe needle
 
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
can mean you're not spending a half
 
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
million dollars on a heart valve
 
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
replacement or on HIV treatment so
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
um harm reduction
 
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
um is is a wide area
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
um but I thought that it was essential
 
00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
since that's what the commission is
 
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
taking on that harm reduction as a
 
00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
phrase ought to be in the governing
 
00:14:38.769 --> 00:14:38.779 align:start position:0%
language for the commission
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
HHS also wanted us in this first part to
 
00:14:45.769 --> 00:14:45.779 align:start position:0%
use the term substance misuse rather
 
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
than substance abuse that's their kind
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
of where they are in terms of the
 
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
language that's used so that's why you
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
see that here too
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
um related to the commission as well
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
you'll see I think very importantly that
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
we're adding
 
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
um the president of the New Hampshire
 
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
Association of chiefs of police I think
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
that's an important seat to add to the
 
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
commission so that we can better
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
coordinate as you'll see later on in the
 
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
bill on harm reduction and syringe
 
00:15:14.689 --> 00:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
exchange services with
 
00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:17.459 align:start position:0%
um local public safety officials because
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's that coordination has been an
 
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
issue so that's the first part
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
um of it and you'll just see a few pages
 
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
really of
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
throwing in the term harm reduction and
 
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
um misuse prevention
 
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:35.220 align:start position:0%
then um
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
if you'll go to uh page three
 
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.610 align:start position:0%
if you'll go to uh page three
um

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
you'll see the opioid abatement advisory
 
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
commission and this section of the bill
 
00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:49.100 align:start position:0%
tries to bring together
 
00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
the work of the opioid abatement
 
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
advisory commission and the governor's
 
00:15:56.889 --> 00:15:56.899 align:start position:0%
Commission on
 
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
Alcohol and Other Drugs that Commission
 
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
on the opioid abatement was set up you
 
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
know rather quickly when we got the
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
settlement funds and and I think wisely
 
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
the governor decided that there ought to
 
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:11.220 align:start position:0%
be a separate commission that dealt with
 
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
those funds it's kind of like what we do
 
00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:14.339 align:start position:0%
with the water settlement and the other
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
other ones it's a good it's a good way
 
00:16:19.129 --> 00:16:19.139 align:start position:0%
to go but what was left undone at that
 
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
time uh was the coordination with the
 
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on alcohol their
 
00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:26.459 align:start position:0%
drugs which provides the advice on how
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
we spend a lot of federal funding on the
 
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
same area so there ought to be
 
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
coordination there I worked with Senator
 
00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:35.579 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald who's on the commission and
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
others on the commission to say here's
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
the kind of language and it was in
 
00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:41.579 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 32 it's in here years as
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
well for do to do that and then at the
 
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
bottom of page three something else that
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
I I think is very important about the
 
00:16:52.129 --> 00:16:52.139 align:start position:0%
bill is the doorways program now we
 
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:53.940 align:start position:0%
don't name it that because that's just a
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
kind of Grant terminology but you'll see
 
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder access points
 
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.970 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder access points
established

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
established
 
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
what I what I thought we needed to do
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
legislatively is that the governor
 
00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:08.579 align:start position:0%
established the doorways program by
 
00:17:11.689 --> 00:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
order because we got Federal grant
 
00:17:11.699 --> 00:17:12.669 align:start position:0%
order because we got Federal grant
funding

00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:15.140 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
opioid response Project funding many
 
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
many millions of dollars going out to
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
the states New Hampshire got enhanced
 
00:17:24.409 --> 00:17:24.419 align:start position:0%
funding because we were in a top ten for
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths and uh the governor
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
um put forward a plan to establish these
 
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
doorways which are access points for all
 
00:17:35.409 --> 00:17:35.419 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
programs and services somebody can come
 
00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
in and get immediately referred to the
 
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.419 align:start position:0%
emergency room if that's what that's
 
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
what they're looking for they can also
 
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
be put in touch with um
 
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
you know all kinds of services
 
00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
uh related
 
00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
to recovery and and other things and
 
00:17:57.169 --> 00:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
health care and other things as well and
 
00:17:59.090 --> 00:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
I think that the doors program has
 
00:18:00.409 --> 00:18:00.419 align:start position:0%
proven the wisdom of the governor's
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
decision to do it this way there are
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
associated with the hospitals they are
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
separate entities
 
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
um that have really served an awfully
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
important role uh and I thought that you
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
know it seemed to me very important
 
00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:15.299 align:start position:0%
having approved itself that we ought to
 
00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
have it in statute and I think also too
 
00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:21.299 align:start position:0%
this kind of sets us in a good place
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
to have state authority over what this
 
00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:27.179 align:start position:0%
does you know Federal grant funded but
 
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure we're doing it in a
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire way and having it in
 
00:18:33.169 --> 00:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
statute is important there are going to
 
00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:36.059 align:start position:0%
be considerations about the stability
 
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
and con
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
continuity of this Sor the federal
 
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
funding if we have this in statute we
 
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
will be able to
 
00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:48.299 align:start position:0%
address if there are any needs and the
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
state needs to consider how do we run
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
this program in conjunction with with
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
Federal funding whether I think this is
 
00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:57.179 align:start position:0%
an important move for uh us to have have
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
done that
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
the next part of the bill on page four
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
gets a little more into the heart of the
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
matters that were of concern uh in this
 
00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:06.590 align:start position:0%
matters that were of concern uh in this
division

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
um in in approaching well okay what do
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
we mean by harm reduction and what are
 
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
we doing you know what does that term
 
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
comprehend and what kind of activities
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
and so on
 
00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:17.299 align:start position:0%
um the bill
 
00:19:21.409 --> 00:19:21.419 align:start position:0%
focuses on the syringe service programs
 
00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:24.539 align:start position:0%
and it tries to do
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
um certain things you'll see
 
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh there on blind seven
 
00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:32.220 align:start position:0%
um I mentioned earlier the chiefs of
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
police Manchester in particular has had
 
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
great concerns about coordination
 
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
um with harm reduction activity and
 
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
syringe Services Program so after a
 
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
great deal of work with the chiefs of
 
00:19:48.289 --> 00:19:48.299 align:start position:0%
police and uh with members of house in
 
00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
the Senate and others came up with this
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
section here to say that there would be
 
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
coordinating collaboration and I think
 
00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
that will set a much better foundation
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement and other folks if
 
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
we have certain service programs do that
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
in that consultation
 
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
um and then um in starting online uh 17
 
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
with uh section 13.
 
00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
um syringe service programs and uh
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
one thing here is you'll see that the
 
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
bill crosses out that sentence about
 
00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:27.299 align:start position:0%
General funds having I think
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
representative Hannah can certainly
 
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
speak to the this and this is an
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
important part of the work that was done
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
with Senator gray to finally get the
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
syringe service program set up to have
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
some assurance that state funds would
 
00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:42.419 align:start position:0%
would not be used for it
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
um made sense politically at the time I
 
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
think that the program has proved such a
 
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
value that having a Prohibition here
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
maybe isn't really functional or
 
00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
appropriate anymore if you talk to the
 
00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
folks who run these programs they say
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
that they really scramble to sustain
 
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
funding federal grants
 
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
the good graces of the hospitals which
 
00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
accept the needles that they receive
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
and will put them in our Disposal system
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
which is expensive rather than having
 
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
that be a charge to the programs I mean
 
00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
a lot of informal relationships cobbled
 
00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
together to make these work a lot of
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
volunteer efforts and so on
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
um right now that that that's the system
 
00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:25.980 align:start position:0%
but they're worried about it how do we
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
sustain the funding because this is the
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
front lines in in preventing a serious
 
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
illness death and and so forth so that's
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
why that's stricken
 
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
um it occurred to me in conversation
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
with representative Edwards and others
 
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
that if that creates uh anxiety to take
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
it out
 
00:21:45.169 --> 00:21:45.179 align:start position:0%
um then maybe don't take it out
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
because frankly if the legislature
 
00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:50.820 align:start position:0%
decides that it would want to put some
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
money into these programs it at that
 
00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
point could repeal this you know and
 
00:21:58.370 --> 00:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
changes anyway so I I thought why not do
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
it now but if that's an issue for the
 
00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
then that's that's why that's there very
 
00:22:06.049 --> 00:22:06.059 align:start position:0%
good representative Shapiro for a
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
question so so if we leave that in and
 
00:22:12.049 --> 00:22:12.059 align:start position:0%
do away with the prohibition on General
 
00:22:12.059 --> 00:22:13.669 align:start position:0%
do away with the prohibition on General
funds

00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
um funding is that in effect saying that
 
00:22:18.049 --> 00:22:18.059 align:start position:0%
we are going to fund them with General
 
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
funds it gets us back thanks for the
 
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:22.980 align:start position:0%
question it gets us back to being silent
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
on the question that's what I thought
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
right and um you know you're you know
 
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
well you're you're division three right
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
that if any money is going to be put in
 
00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
the budget the next budget this this uh
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
any any reminds me of putting the next
 
00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
budget um I suppose there's a situation
 
00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
where somebody now could come to join
 
00:22:42.169 --> 00:22:42.179 align:start position:0%
physical and say we you know we really
 
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:44.220 align:start position:0%
need some funding for for X we've got
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
some in some general you know in some of
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
our other funding in HHS or whatever I
 
00:22:50.029 --> 00:22:50.039 align:start position:0%
don't anticipate that but it would make
 
00:22:51.289 --> 00:22:51.299 align:start position:0%
it would get us back to soccer it would
 
00:22:53.149 --> 00:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
take other action for it actually for
 
00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
the funds to come from the general funds
 
00:22:57.289 --> 00:22:57.299 align:start position:0%
um but you know if that CR if that if
 
00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:00.260 align:start position:0%
that in itself is an issue right now
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
legislatures can do what they want
 
00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:06.059 align:start position:0%
representative Weber for a question
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:07.559 --> 00:23:08.750 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:10.980 align:start position:0%
it's partly a question and partly a
 
00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:13.559 align:start position:0%
statement if that's acceptable
 
00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:14.330 align:start position:0%
statement if that's acceptable
um

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
as I read the language that
 
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:19.740 align:start position:0%
you are proposing to strike through it
 
00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
it says the use of state general funds
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
shall be prohibited unless otherwise
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
appropriated by the general court so am
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
I not correct in Reading what is in
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
existence now as saying G General Court
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
any time you want to through the budget
 
00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:39.740 align:start position:0%
process or in another appropriation
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate money for this program it's
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
fine all that I read that as prohibiting
 
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
is the use of funds that were
 
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
appropriated for some other purpose and
 
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
unspent being lateral to this program am
 
00:23:58.610 --> 00:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
I correct about that thank you and I
 
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
think so and uh
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
you know and one could argue that maybe
 
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
it would make sense to strike it that's
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
why I put I did this because that
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
circumstance might come up in between
 
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
budgets and joint physical would then
 
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
um you know have that that opportunity
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
because if it be you know if it looks
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
like a needle exchange program is going
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
to shut down or or something
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
um oh my gosh you know we wouldn't want
 
00:24:23.159 --> 00:24:23.930 align:start position:0%
um oh my gosh you know we wouldn't want
that

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:23.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:25.559 align:start position:0%
um and it's sometimes it's easier than
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
that you know if it is it's silent so
 
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
that there's that flexibility but as I
 
00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.210 align:start position:0%
that there's that flexibility but as I
said

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know if that's something that's of
 
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
if striking has a concern fine you know
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
then I think that that makes the
 
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
committee more comfortable with that
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
section of the bill there because really
 
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
the heart of this is um the way that
 
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
I've handled starting in section 14. the
 
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
issue about paraphernalia
 
00:24:51.049 --> 00:24:51.059 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of bills about
 
00:24:51.059 --> 00:24:52.010 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of bills about
this

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
we have passed a very narrow bill on
 
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips that says that they
 
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
can be used but it's a larger issue
 
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
um because there's lots of supplies
 
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
which might be construed as
 
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.310 align:start position:0%
which might be construed as
paraphernalia

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia
 
00:25:09.649 --> 00:25:09.659 align:start position:0%
the approach that I took in the bill
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
was not to say that possession of those
 
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
is legal I I think that that is
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
something that may be a step too far
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
right now for law enforcement and I I
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:24.179 align:start position:0%
what I didn't want to see is a situation
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
where the folks who are licensed are an
 
00:25:30.289 --> 00:25:30.299 align:start position:0%
organizations licensed by HHS to go out
 
00:25:33.409 --> 00:25:33.419 align:start position:0%
and deliver harm reduction supplies
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
might be subject to arrest
 
00:25:39.649 --> 00:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
I I just think we can't ask people who
 
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
are are there to do that so what it
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
tries to do is to set up
 
00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
um drug checking and then also you look
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
on to
 
00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:51.059 align:start position:0%
page five
 
00:25:54.529 --> 00:25:54.539 align:start position:0%
um drug checking equipment drug supplies
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
eligible activities and so on
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
um all of this looks a whole lot like
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:06.409 --> 00:26:06.419 align:start position:0%
um and so this is the approach the bill
 
00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
takes I do think that this will help
 
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
save lives
 
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
I think it'll offer clarity
 
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:16.740 align:start position:0%
and I also think that it's very
 
00:26:18.529 --> 00:26:18.539 align:start position:0%
significant that this is a version and
 
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
approach that
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
um I won't and I won't you know Beth is
 
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
here but after a lot of work with the
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
Chiefs and uh and other law enforcement
 
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
folks that this this seemed comfortable
 
00:26:33.769 --> 00:26:33.779 align:start position:0%
they seemed okay with this approach to
 
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
it so that's why that's why it looks
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:42.409 --> 00:26:42.419 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Senator
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
um a couple of thoughts here one of
 
00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
which is for example a glossary type
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
section I think may put some members
 
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:55.740 align:start position:0%
more at ease and you you have one more
 
00:26:58.370 --> 00:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
or less at the end of page four but
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
other terms such as access points or
 
00:27:03.769 --> 00:27:03.779 align:start position:0%
things of that nature that may need more
 
00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
fleshing out
 
00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:08.039 align:start position:0%
would you be opposed to that and can you
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
see the
 
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
the uh the concern there
 
00:27:15.049 --> 00:27:15.059 align:start position:0%
uh that that would make some sense I I
 
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
think you know access point I I think of
 
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
the doorways I think of um the uh harm
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
reduction services that are being
 
00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
offered and it's a variety of them uh
 
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
you know SOS recovery does it one way
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
the folks in Nashua do it another way
 
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
the folks in Manchester do it another
 
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
way so
 
00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:33.539 align:start position:0%
um I just I think the definition would
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
need to uh in a sense take a snapshot of
 
00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:37.860 align:start position:0%
what we're doing now
 
00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
okay so yes thank you understood and
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
another thought here uh on page five
 
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
under drug supplies a whole list of
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
items here
 
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.970 align:start position:0%
items here
um

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:49.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
yet on the page before it only addresses
 
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.990 align:start position:0%
yet on the page before it only addresses
syringes

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
syringes
 
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
so in the instance of pipes or
 
00:27:59.149 --> 00:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia things of that nature is
 
00:28:00.289 --> 00:28:00.299 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:28:03.169 --> 00:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
being exchanged now or is that
 
00:28:06.529 --> 00:28:06.539 align:start position:0%
definition section on page five
 
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
just all-inclusive
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh what I'm specifically referring to is
 
00:28:15.409 --> 00:28:15.419 align:start position:0%
page five lines nine through eleven
 
00:28:15.419 --> 00:28:16.610 align:start position:0%
page five lines nine through eleven
right

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question now
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see what this what this does is
 
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.330 align:start position:0%
you'll see what this what this does is
refers

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
refers
 
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
um back more particularly to on to lines
 
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.730 align:start position:0%
um back more particularly to on to lines

32.
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
um about this
 
00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me a little bit a little bit
 
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
further up
 
00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.049 align:start position:0%
further up
um

00:28:36.049 --> 00:28:36.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me line 26.
 
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.149 align:start position:0%
excuse me line 26.
that

00:28:41.149 --> 00:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
this notwithstanding of the law of the
 
00:28:45.549 --> 00:28:45.559 align:start position:0%
contrary that is kind of referencing the
 
00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia laws okay so what it's
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
saying that okay paraphernalia laws
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes are explicit sometimes they're
 
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
not so much vocal no statutes about what
 
00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
is considered paraphernalia so the
 
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
attempt here is to clarify for the
 
00:29:03.649 --> 00:29:03.659 align:start position:0%
practitioners practitioners of the
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
exchange programs and for law
 
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
enforcement here's the list
 
00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
and um the drug supplies
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
um these are things that are being
 
00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.630 align:start position:0%
um these are things that are being
distributed

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
and there some of them could be in a
 
00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:17.820 align:start position:0%
kind of a gray area
 
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
each one is being distributed because of
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
demonstrable Public Health need
 
00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
that that you know the wounds
 
00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.289 align:start position:0%
that that you know the wounds
um

00:29:30.289 --> 00:29:30.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
clean straws I mean there's some things
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
I mean I I know there's discomfort about
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
this but these are some of the ways that
 
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:37.740 align:start position:0%
the drugs are consumed and if they're
 
00:29:39.889 --> 00:29:39.899 align:start position:0%
not clean
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
it's a public health problem for HIV for
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
hep C you name it so that's these are
 
00:29:48.409 --> 00:29:48.419 align:start position:0%
the things that you will find in the
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
at this at the syringe exchange sites
 
00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
um you know programs so that that's why
 
00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:57.769 align:start position:0%
um you know programs so that that's why
um

00:29:57.769 --> 00:29:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
that's why and then on the drug checking
 
00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:01.909 align:start position:0%
that's why and then on the drug checking
um

00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
things too you don't want somebody who's
 
00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.470 align:start position:0%
things too you don't want somebody who's
transporting

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
transporting
 
00:30:09.649 --> 00:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
uh some Supply or some syringe or
 
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
whatever for checking to be then caught
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
for possession
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
so that's why you have
 
00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
um that section in in there
 
00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
so uh I think that it's one of those
 
00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
ones where if you read the document that
 
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
was provided today you'll get a little
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
clearer sense of just how these harm
 
00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:30.059 align:start position:0%
reduction supplies are used what what
 
00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:34.140 align:start position:0%
the reason for them are and um I'm the
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
bill as I said want is taking the
 
00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:37.740 align:start position:0%
approach not to say that it's legal for
 
00:30:39.289 --> 00:30:39.299 align:start position:0%
anybody who has anything to possess them
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
that's good that's it's kind of that's
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
in a law enforcement decision for the
 
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.970 align:start position:0%
in a law enforcement decision for the
individual

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:43.980 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
but for the service provider
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
I don't think they should be subject to
 
00:30:51.769 --> 00:30:51.779 align:start position:0%
arrest for paraphernalia law violations
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
because they are Distributing these harm
 
00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
reduction supplies so that's that's why
 
00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
the bill takes the shape it does
 
00:31:00.169 --> 00:31:00.179 align:start position:0%
but thank you for that because to see
 
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
you know pipes and snorting straws pipe
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
covers in the same list as you know
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
water saline and a tourniquet it raises
 
00:31:12.049 --> 00:31:12.059 align:start position:0%
some thoughts yeah representative
 
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:13.980 align:start position:0%
Shapiro please for question
 
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to comment or ask
 
00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
about the overlap between House Bill 287
 
00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
which I believe was concurred
 
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
um with I don't know that it's been
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor or not but that
 
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
refers to
 
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
um drug paraphernalia and it includes
 
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
xylazine as well as fentanyl with
 
00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
um as one of the permitted drug checking
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
tools that are that that would not be
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
included would not be
 
00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
subject people to penalties so I'm
 
00:31:51.889 --> 00:31:51.899 align:start position:0%
wondering if that should
 
00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:53.820 align:start position:0%
if that's taking care of the situation
 
00:31:58.850 --> 00:31:58.860 align:start position:0%
or if xylazine should be listed in these
 
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
um drug testing in in 239 along with
 
00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:04.740 align:start position:0%
fentanyl strips thanks for the thank you
 
00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:07.740 align:start position:0%
for the question and um
 
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
you know the Senate decided to do some
 
00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
things about xylodine we've had some
 
00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
thorough presentations about it on the
 
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
governor's commission
 
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:15.889 align:start position:0%
governor's commission
um

00:32:15.889 --> 00:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:17.820 align:start position:0%
the wound issue
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
um let alone the fact that Narcan
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't work on it
 
00:32:24.649 --> 00:32:24.659 align:start position:0%
um it's it's it's terrible and gonna be
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
a complicated issue
 
00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:27.889 align:start position:0%
a complicated issue
um

00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
two things about this bill
 
00:32:33.289 --> 00:32:33.299 align:start position:0%
right now I do not believe there are any
 
00:32:36.169 --> 00:32:36.179 align:start position:0%
commercially available xylodine tests
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
maybe folks I think they're being
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
developed but I'm not sure that they're
 
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:40.980 align:start position:0%
there yet so but the Senate was
 
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
concerned about being ready for that
 
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
um I did ask
 
00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
some research to be done on
 
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
if there are issues of overlap with the
 
00:32:54.169 --> 00:32:54.179 align:start position:0%
bill the federal test stripped and the
 
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
xylodine bill and that that one and it
 
00:32:58.269 --> 00:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
seems that
 
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
the sections of law and the approach
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
takes particular different so I think
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
they're complementary
 
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
um but I think there could be some
 
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
further look
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
at as whether any of this actually needs
 
00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:13.940 align:start position:0%
to change my feeling is that it doesn't
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
but that's something that you know by
 
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
the Fall may become clearer
 
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative Weber for a question
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh my question is
 
00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
kind of the coming at the same thing
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
issue that I think
 
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
Madam chair was coming at from a
 
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
different direction when I look at the
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
list of drug supplies
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
I Wonder Part of Me wonders why include
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
cotton filters alcohol wipes water
 
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
saline and tourniquets and probably the
 
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
disposal containers as well in wound
 
00:33:58.850 --> 00:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
care items because those are all none of
 
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
those are are illegal items they're
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
items that are used commonly in all
 
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
kinds of different practices is the
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
purpose for including those in this list
 
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
simply one that means that they would
 
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
then be eligible for funding if if
 
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
funding were available or
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
is would there be
 
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:26.220 align:start position:0%
some use to recognizing that some of
 
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
these things are not like the others and
 
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
some of them are already perfectly legal
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
to have and to use for whatever purpose
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question and um you know
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
I I'm not an attorney and it might be
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
the Chiefs the police can give you some
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
clarity on this but you know a cotton
 
00:34:44.879 --> 00:34:45.770 align:start position:0%
clarity on this but you know a cotton
ball

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
ball
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
or a tourniquet
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
um in one circumstance maybe just seen
 
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
as some medical supply in those
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances it might be seen as
 
00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.970 align:start position:0%
circumstances it might be seen as
paraphernalia

00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia
 
00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:58.140 align:start position:0%
and that's that's that's the clarity
 
00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
that I wanted that for these folks who
 
00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
have have this the the boxes of these
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
materials in their van or wherever and
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
they're out doing a new exchange
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
programs and if people say I need some
 
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
of that or need some of that this that
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
the folks running the programs might
 
00:35:17.569 --> 00:35:17.579 align:start position:0%
would not be subject to any ambiguity
 
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
over whether or not they are
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
Distributing illegal paraphernalia with
 
00:35:23.569 --> 00:35:23.579 align:start position:0%
these things so the list is it's kind of
 
00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
comprehensive but you know this is
 
00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.589 align:start position:0%
comprehensive but you know this is
recognizing

00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
recognizing
 
00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:28.250 align:start position:0%
recognizing
um

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
so um Madam chair you know I've already
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
I'm already rambled on but let me just
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
be I'll try to be a little briefer and
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
then maybe um representative Nagel could
 
00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:45.800 align:start position:0%
actually talk more about the uh
 
00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
definitions issue
 
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
so another thing here uh you know and
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
again worked for a number of years on
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
this kind of issues of um training so
 
00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
bottom of page five
 
00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:00.300 align:start position:0%
um continuing medical education
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
requirement uh heard from a lot of
 
00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
of uh medical personnel that the the
 
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
concerns about the so-called X waiver
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
which has since been repealed but that
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
very much limited how many patients you
 
00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
could treat under what circumstances and
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
what kind of Licensing you needed to do
 
00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:23.060 align:start position:0%
medically assisted treatment for
 
00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:25.220 align:start position:0%
substance misuse
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
and so originally the bill
 
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
looked at finding ways uh to make it
 
00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
easier to obtain the X waiver and have
 
00:36:37.849 --> 00:36:37.859 align:start position:0%
some requirements around getting it so
 
00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
that we could have more potentially more
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
practitioners serve more
 
00:36:42.359 --> 00:36:44.210 align:start position:0%
practitioners serve more
patients

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:44.220 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
um our federal delegation members got
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
the X waiver removed federally
 
00:36:52.609 --> 00:36:52.619 align:start position:0%
so what this then Tran then what I did
 
00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
is I rewrote this to say okay the other
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
issue here
 
00:36:59.450 --> 00:36:59.460 align:start position:0%
is that folks may or may not be getting
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
any substantive harm reduction education
 
00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
in their medical programs
 
00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
some of it's generationally
 
00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:10.740 align:start position:0%
some of it just might be the the school
 
00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:13.140 align:start position:0%
that you happen to go to
 
00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
um and uh representative Nagel worked on
 
00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
on this language as well but this seemed
 
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
to be an appropriate way saying when you
 
00:37:23.329 --> 00:37:23.339 align:start position:0%
go up for re-licensing that you would
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
have gone online and uh taken up you
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
know this kind of standard three-hour
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
course this we do this with a lot of of
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
that continuing education
 
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
and um this will I think also address
 
00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:38.220 align:start position:0%
some of the stigma issues there are some
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
practitioners and some practices who are
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
not you know what have some anxieties
 
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
about are we really going to be dealing
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
with this medical issue and I think that
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
the education will help with that so
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
that's why that's there
 
00:37:53.089 --> 00:37:53.099 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:37:53.099 --> 00:37:54.410 align:start position:0%
and then
um

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:58.310 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
um get down to the the definitional side
 
00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.349 align:start position:0%
um get down to the the definitional side
that

00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
um starts the middle of page six and uh
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
I as I said I think maybe best of
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
Representative Nagel comes up and talks
 
00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
about how we got to this point with it
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
but it really gets to the heart of some
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
of the issues that representative
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
Edwards had and others that um if we're
 
00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
going to be putting harm reduction and
 
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
recognizing it as a major
 
00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
activity undertaking that the governor's
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
commission every and eight all the other
 
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
folks are doing and we're gonna you know
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
if we're undertaking that then the
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
legislature and if the legislature some
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
potentially you know might have to deal
 
00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:40.140 align:start position:0%
with funding issues around it we ought
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
to have a definition that people feel
 
00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:43.740 align:start position:0%
comfortable with
 
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
um and as you know from the last hearing
 
00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
here there was great anxiety that this
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
somehow opened the door to Safe
 
00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:52.380 align:start position:0%
injection sites
 
00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
um I think actually this definition was
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
written to ensure that it did not but
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
um I this is an important issue that we
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
have to have some clarity on as I
 
00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
mentioned the last time I was before you
 
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
I was the chair of our study committee
 
00:39:11.329 --> 00:39:11.339 align:start position:0%
on harm reduction last summer and as a
 
00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
result of that study committee we
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
explicitly said in our report that we do
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
not recommend say safe injection sites
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
that was an important you know our work
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
with the Mayors with the law enforcement
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
others that that was an important place
 
00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:29.099 align:start position:0%
to land in that study
 
00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
um so a harm reduction definition here
 
00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:34.380 align:start position:0%
said here's what here's what you can do
 
00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
and that was the approach that indicated
 
00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:41.099 align:start position:0%
that it did not include that but if the
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
house would be more comfortable with an
 
00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
explicit statement that nothing in this
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
definition shall include the
 
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
establishment of safe injection sites we
 
00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
do that kind of thing
 
00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
um but I I think it's awfully important
 
00:39:56.089 --> 00:39:56.099 align:start position:0%
and this is why the build was retained
 
00:39:58.849 --> 00:39:58.859 align:start position:0%
by Revenue Edwards to have there be
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
comfort with this I don't think there's
 
00:40:02.089 --> 00:40:02.099 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of disagreement over the
 
00:40:04.569 --> 00:40:04.579 align:start position:0%
other parts of the bill but
 
00:40:07.609 --> 00:40:07.619 align:start position:0%
this is where we need the comfort so I I
 
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
you know representative Nagel I really
 
00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
appreciate his work and you know and
 
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
then harking back you know resident
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
Solway uh um representative foreign reps
 
00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
hand and it's always you know then
 
00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:21.260 align:start position:0%
Karen no there's a lot of people caring
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot of folks who can
 
00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
can help you with this and I just soon
 
00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.230 align:start position:0%
can help you with this and I just soon
stop

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:28.859 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you so much and
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
considering um you know the
 
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
circumstances today are rather unique
 
00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
but I appreciate it just very quickly
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
though before you go unless you have to
 
00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:36.060 align:start position:0%
run uh just quickly so the lines you're
 
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
referring to specifically with regards
 
00:40:40.849 --> 00:40:40.859 align:start position:0%
to Safe injection sites page six What
 
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
specifically lines
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh you said you said if we were to uh
 
00:40:48.589 --> 00:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
amend it and place it in there where
 
00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
I would actually I think what you might
 
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
want to do and again representative
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
Nagel might be the best guy I don't know
 
00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
this is just add another
 
00:41:00.119 --> 00:41:00.770 align:start position:0%
this is just add another
um

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
another letter here in a year or
 
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
something that says nothing in this
 
00:41:06.829 --> 00:41:06.839 align:start position:0%
definition shall include
 
00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:09.300 align:start position:0%
um safe injection sites or something
 
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
like that so at the end of page six or
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
the top of page seven you say
 
00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:16.140 align:start position:0%
somewhere there okay
 
00:41:18.849 --> 00:41:18.859 align:start position:0%
yeah representative is that that might
 
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
if that's what's desired that might
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
um provide a nice uh closure of the
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
brackets because that section starts
 
00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
this shall be limited to the following
 
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
and you could then end if it makes you
 
00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
feel more comfortable with the second
 
00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
bracket which is nothing is intended to
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
authorize yeah whatever you're not
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
intending to authorize and you can wrap
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
that up sorry if I may Madam chair you
 
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
could wrap that up real tight uh and say
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
that but also say and that nose funding
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
shall be you know no no funding shall be
 
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
provided for I mean you could you if if
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
that's important and I think it probably
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
it probably is you could wrap that up
 
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
real tight and you and you won't know
 
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
how to do that with legislative language
 
00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:07.740 align:start position:0%
but uh I think that um it reflects the
 
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
sentiment of the report and I think it
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
reflects where the governor is is to
 
00:42:14.329 --> 00:42:14.339 align:start position:0%
have that prohibition and it would be
 
00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
useful I think in the language here real
 
00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:18.839 align:start position:0%
good and then one more thing uh in
 
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
debriefing for today's session it was
 
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
brought up that uh Manchester and I'm
 
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
not familiar with the facts had a policy
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
issue or something to that effect with
 
00:42:32.569 --> 00:42:32.579 align:start position:0%
regards to new needle exchange programs
 
00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
there was a conflict in terms of a
 
00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
policy that somebody had that conflicted
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
with the program do you know anything
 
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
about that or maybe others do and could
 
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
expand on that I can just speak briefly
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
because I had a lot of conversation with
 
00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
mayor Craig and with the chief of police
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
and and others there and I will say
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
Manchester has is really
 
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
um the city of Manchester has has really
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
tried is trying very very hard through
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
its EMTs through the program it's even
 
00:43:02.569 --> 00:43:02.579 align:start position:0%
offering to provide services surrounding
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
towns on harm reduction it's the
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
epicenter of a lot of our issues a lot a
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
lot of lives lost and so forth the
 
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
concern arose when the initiation of a
 
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
syringe exchange site was not done with
 
00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.530 align:start position:0%
syringe exchange site was not done with
coordination

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
coordination
 
00:43:20.329 --> 00:43:20.339 align:start position:0%
um with local officials I think
 
00:43:23.569 --> 00:43:23.579 align:start position:0%
sufficiently and therefore where it was
 
00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
set up how it was run
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
um created real real real real anxieties
 
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:33.180 align:start position:0%
and um and we heard a lot about it in
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
the study committee you can look at the
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
people who came to testify about it
 
00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:40.140 align:start position:0%
um and I know that hope for New
 
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:41.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire recovery and other groups have
 
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
since that time really kind of stepped
 
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
in to try to make sure that the program
 
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
has restored regained the trust and so
 
00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.470 align:start position:0%
has restored regained the trust and so
forth

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
forth
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
um but it's it suggests to me that's why
 
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:51.660 align:start position:0%
it was important to include that
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
language about Constitution uh there are
 
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
there you know Portsmouth doesn't have a
 
00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
program right there's some other cities
 
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
that don't have them and um if they're
 
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:01.380 align:start position:0%
going to set up a syringe exchange then
 
00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
they ought the the you know I think we
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
can we can help by making sure that they
 
00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.030 align:start position:0%
can we can help by making sure that they
know

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:11.220 align:start position:0%
um that these programs at HHS you know
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
is authorizing are going to be done in
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
ways that they can feel comfortable with
 
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:16.740 align:start position:0%
locally so
 
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
that's that's a little more background
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
there but I'll just tell you more about
 
00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.650 align:start position:0%
there but I'll just tell you more about
Manchester

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
real good since we're on that topic a
 
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
former representative Han and you had a
 
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
were you did you have something to add
 
00:44:29.089 --> 00:44:29.099 align:start position:0%
to this particular issue before we move
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
to the next
 
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
okay you'll wait anyone else want to
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
contribute to the Manchester policy
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
conflict issue okay thank you very much
 
00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
any other questions for Senator Waters
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
really appreciate your time thank you so
 
00:44:43.089 --> 00:44:43.099 align:start position:0%
much I'm going to stick around very good
 
00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:47.750 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
okay

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
any thoughts at this juncture from the
 
00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:52.380 align:start position:0%
members all right
 
00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple at this point uh there was a
 
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
handout I know that representative
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
Edwards gave to you to give to us do we
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
have that already
 
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
I think you you should have it there are
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
actually two separate handouts as
 
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
everybody should have and if anybody on
 
00:45:08.329 --> 00:45:08.339 align:start position:0%
that side doesn't have one or I might
 
00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
okay excellent so we all have what we're
 
00:45:34.609 --> 00:45:34.619 align:start position:0%
supposed to per chairman edwards's
 
00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
request from Mr Ripple
 
00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:38.329 align:start position:0%
request from Mr Ripple
okay

00:45:38.329 --> 00:45:38.339 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:41.329 --> 00:45:41.339 align:start position:0%
at this point I know we have some
 
00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
members here who are interested in
 
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
talking uh however order you'd like to
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
go is fine with me but I know it was
 
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
asked representative Nagel I know you
 
00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
have a lot of experience not only in
 
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
this bill but in other areas and perhaps
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
you could give your take and prior to
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
that if you could just go through your
 
00:46:02.809 --> 00:46:02.819 align:start position:0%
credentials for the members of the
 
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
committee I think that would be very
 
00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:07.740 align:start position:0%
helpful anywhere you'd like
 
00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mrs Madam chairman and if you
 
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
were chairwoman thank you and if just
 
00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
shutting off that mic I think it might
 
00:46:32.329 --> 00:46:32.339 align:start position:0%
lessen the perfect whenever you're ready
 
00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
um thank you for this opportunity
 
00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:35.089 align:start position:0%
um thank you for this opportunity
um

00:46:35.089 --> 00:46:35.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
yeah a couple minutes ago I was actually
 
00:46:38.569 --> 00:46:38.579 align:start position:0%
taking care of the people we're talking
 
00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:41.220 align:start position:0%
about right now so and I I really The
 
00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:43.380 align:start position:0%
more I've talked with Senator Waters The
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
more I've been impressed with how
 
00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.309 align:start position:0%
more I've been impressed with how
thorough

00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
thorough
 
00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:49.380 align:start position:0%
this process has been and how important
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
this issue is
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
um just I'm gonna go a little bass
 
00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
backwards here if that's all right but
 
00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
he addressed the issue of continuing
 
00:46:58.849 --> 00:46:58.859 align:start position:0%
education requirements and and the
 
00:47:01.849 --> 00:47:01.859 align:start position:0%
health care force and before I forget I
 
00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
really wanted to throw out there that in
 
00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
in the average medical school there is
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
virtually no education on addiction
 
00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:08.510 align:start position:0%
virtually no education on addiction
there's

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
the average doctor will get seven hours
 
00:47:13.609 --> 00:47:13.619 align:start position:0%
of treatment uh teaching in his entire
 
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
his or her entire medical education how
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
to manage pain
 
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
um that's an average some schools don't
 
00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
do it at all
 
00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
um I just personally funded a program at
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
the University of Rochester to make sure
 
00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
um issue was addressed so it's not
 
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
happening so um that's why this issue is
 
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
even more important as the health care
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
providers really aren't well educated on
 
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
these issues
 
00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
so you want to know about me
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm a physician I practice in Concord
 
00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
for over 30 years I was actually
 
00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
recruited to New Hampshire I'm a
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
physical medicine and rehabilitation
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
specialist we deal with people with
 
00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
complex disabilities
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
I was recruited here actually to work
 
00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
with Easter Seals on the kinds of things
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
that you see on the ads and Easter Seals
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
and I also was recruited to start a
 
00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
program and head injury which
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately never happened
 
00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I was never
 
00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
taught really in education and that
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
became quite apparent is I started
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
managing these complex issues including
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
end of Life Care was how important pain
 
00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
was part of all that
 
00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
and I was struck with how little we were
 
00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
taught how what we were taught was
 
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
inaccurate and how there had to be a
 
00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
better way so the last 35 years of my
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
life has been a journey on trying to
 
00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.170 align:start position:0%
life has been a journey on trying to
learn

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:27.180 align:start position:0%
learn
 
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
more on how to do that one of the things
 
00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
I got from Medical School the University
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
of Rochester was to understand that the
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
doctor's office is not the patient's
 
00:48:37.609 --> 00:48:37.619 align:start position:0%
home the patient's home is in the world
 
00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
and that if I wanted to influence what
 
00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
goes on in the world in their lives then
 
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
I needed to get involved with
 
00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
policy advocacy things like that so for
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
the last 30 years I've been involved
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
first advocating for the rights of um
 
00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
women that have lost a child we moved on
 
00:48:56.809 --> 00:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
to post-concussive syndrome and then
 
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
later on pain I've been involved in
 
00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
most of the legislation and Rule mate
 
00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
writing in this state on on Pain Care
 
00:49:07.849 --> 00:49:07.859 align:start position:0%
policy over the last 33 years I
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
initiated and wrote all the opioid
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
policies we updated them
 
00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
recently I became struck that when we
 
00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
have these beautiful models that you
 
00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
handed out here that they always talk
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
about patient-centered care but we kind
 
00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
of forget that the patients in the
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
center and that we neglect to listen to
 
00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.030 align:start position:0%
center and that we neglect to listen to
them

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
so as a result of that I um I did three
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
things number one is um be out of anger
 
00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
more than anything I wrote a book called
 
00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:34.859 align:start position:0%
needless suffering which is a book on
 
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
Pain Care policy in the United States
 
00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
it's actually sold worldwide and and
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
what started out as an angry catharsis
 
00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
turned into a message that I was really
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
shocked how well this translated to
 
00:49:49.089 --> 00:49:49.099 align:start position:0%
multiple groups
 
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
I also got involved with the NFL in
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
terms of creating Pain Care policy for
 
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
them thinking that naively perhaps that
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
if they could change the way we look at
 
00:49:59.450 --> 00:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
head injury perhaps the way they could
 
00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
change the way you look at pain and then
 
00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
I started a couple of non-profits that
 
00:50:07.069 --> 00:50:07.079 align:start position:0%
basically spoke for the patient so their
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
patient run patient directed and they
 
00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:10.500 align:start position:0%
just happen to have a doctor stuck in
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
the middle of all that
 
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that bothered me a
 
00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
lot was that I believe and I will
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
believe till the day I die that opioids
 
00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
have a role in terms of managing pain
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
um and that denying patients access to
 
00:50:29.329 --> 00:50:29.339 align:start position:0%
this can be dangerous and and a bad and
 
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
bad policy whether it's for chronic pain
 
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
acute pain end of life pain
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
um whatever we also understand that it's
 
00:50:38.329 --> 00:50:38.339 align:start position:0%
not for everybody
 
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
um I think that we crafted legislation
 
00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
very well to try to prevent what
 
00:50:44.569 --> 00:50:44.579 align:start position:0%
happened with an opioid crisis we could
 
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
be very if you want we could talk for
 
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
hours about the Genesis of that crisis
 
00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:50.170 align:start position:0%
hours about the Genesis of that crisis
but

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:50.180 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
I've always believed that for every
 
00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
complex social problem there's a
 
00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
solution that's neat simple and wrong
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
and I think the way we've addressed the
 
00:51:00.049 --> 00:51:00.059 align:start position:0%
opioid crisis has been neat simple and
 
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
wrong and I think what we've ended up
 
00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
doing is harming people that we're
 
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:07.140 align:start position:0%
benefiting from opioid therapy
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
um because of that
 
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
um I got I I started getting involved in
 
00:51:14.809 --> 00:51:14.819 align:start position:0%
a number of legislative areas that I
 
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
felt that these people need to be stood
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
up for and that's functionally why I ran
 
00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
for the office I wanted to get involved
 
00:51:22.609 --> 00:51:22.619 align:start position:0%
in all these committees that I'm
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
creating I wanted to be on the opioid
 
00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:26.700 align:start position:0%
abatement commission to make sure that
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
we directed those funds to where they
 
00:51:30.829 --> 00:51:30.839 align:start position:0%
needed to go and not exclude a group
 
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
that we call opioid refugees
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
what opioid refugees are are patients
 
00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:38.460 align:start position:0%
that were doing just fine and long-term
 
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:40.740 align:start position:0%
opioid therapy that now can't get access
 
00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:42.839 align:start position:0%
to care and so frequently what they do
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
is one of three things they either
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
suffer needlessly they go to the streets
 
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
to buy their drugs which we call drug
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
misuse or they commit suicide and
 
00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we do have a suicide watch
 
00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
that we're keeping
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
um and we've counted over a thousand
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
suicides who are basically patients that
 
00:52:04.849 --> 00:52:04.859 align:start position:0%
just don't have access to care and just
 
00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
can't live with their pain anymore and
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
that's a bare minimum number we know the
 
00:52:12.109 --> 00:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
number is substantially higher than that
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
so my motivation in getting involved in
 
00:52:16.609 --> 00:52:16.619 align:start position:0%
this whole harm reduction thing and this
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
bill in particular and also Senate Bill
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
32 and the opioid abatement commission
 
00:52:23.329 --> 00:52:23.339 align:start position:0%
which I'm the vice chair of
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
is is that I really felt that um
 
00:52:30.349 --> 00:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
these this money that's pouring in
 
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
um for opioid abatement and for other
 
00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:35.460 align:start position:0%
things really needed to address a
 
00:52:37.609 --> 00:52:37.619 align:start position:0%
broader group of people
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
um we've for 30 years we've been
 
00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
championing championing integrative care
 
00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
and balanced public policy between the
 
00:52:47.089 --> 00:52:47.099 align:start position:0%
people that suffer from paying the
 
00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
people that suffer from the drugs that
 
00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
we use from Pain and trying to achieve
 
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
this balance that we keep missing
 
00:52:56.329 --> 00:52:56.339 align:start position:0%
that was my motivation so when this bill
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
came to us I was I was pretty excited at
 
00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:00.170 align:start position:0%
came to us I was I was pretty excited at
first

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:00.180 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:01.430 align:start position:0%
first
um

00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
primarily because if you look at the
 
00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
statute that creates the opioid
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
abatement commission it has no there's
 
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
nothing in it that will pertain to my
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
people so for example if I'm on pain
 
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
medicine and my doctor suddenly out of
 
00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
fear of DEA reprisal or on Medical Board
 
00:53:20.329 --> 00:53:20.339 align:start position:0%
reprisal refuses to write opioid for me
 
00:53:23.089 --> 00:53:23.099 align:start position:0%
anymore and I go to the street those
 
00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
patients aren't included there's no
 
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
protection there's no harm reduction
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
measure for them and that was a problem
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
for me that I felt needed to be solved I
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
think Senate Bill 32 actually did solve
 
00:53:35.569 --> 00:53:35.579 align:start position:0%
some of those issues but if you look at
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
that bill the term harm reduction is in
 
00:53:40.609 --> 00:53:40.619 align:start position:0%
that bill but it is not defined when
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
these two bills came before our
 
00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:44.220 align:start position:0%
committee the questions that we were
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
asking is what do you mean by harm
 
00:53:49.069 --> 00:53:49.079 align:start position:0%
reduction what do you mean by substance
 
00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
misuse why are you using these terms and
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
that became really important to me to
 
00:53:57.049 --> 00:53:57.059 align:start position:0%
have those terms defined so number one
 
00:53:59.569 --> 00:53:59.579 align:start position:0%
is that we're doing what we need to do
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
not doing what we shouldn't be doing and
 
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
including all the people that should be
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
included so like for example when we get
 
00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement funds we have that term
 
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
harm reduction in the bill my people can
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
be included in that bill because I think
 
00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
that that's important
 
00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:14.569 align:start position:0%
that that's important
um

00:54:14.569 --> 00:54:14.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
the misuse issue is important to me for
 
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
a couple reasons
 
00:54:18.599 --> 00:54:19.190 align:start position:0%
a couple reasons
um

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:21.049 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:21.059 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
the word abuse is bait this is the way
 
00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:25.140 align:start position:0%
we look at this in terms of addiction
 
00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
and Pain Care policy
 
00:54:30.049 --> 00:54:30.059 align:start position:0%
um abuse misuse is kind of a generic
 
00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
term that includes multiple other things
 
00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
so for example abuse is taking a
 
00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
substance for a me uh for purpose other
 
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
than what's medically indicated so for
 
00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
example if I take
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
um an opioid to get high you know that
 
00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
that's that's not a medical indication
 
00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
we don't prescribe opioids to make
 
00:54:49.849 --> 00:54:49.859 align:start position:0%
people high
 
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
um diverting a drug to a source other
 
00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
than what was intended that would be
 
00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
considered abuse
 
00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
um but there's also this other thing
 
00:54:59.569 --> 00:54:59.579 align:start position:0%
that we know as epidemic in our
 
00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
population and that's self-management
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
where patients are not getting the care
 
00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:05.700 align:start position:0%
they need and that's another long
 
00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
discussion we can have but they're not
 
00:55:08.809 --> 00:55:08.819 align:start position:0%
getting the care that we need so they
 
00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
just take it to themselves and they go
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
to the streets they go wherever to take
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
care of it the CDC guidelines on opioid
 
00:55:18.049 --> 00:55:18.059 align:start position:0%
prescribing just documented last two
 
00:55:20.569 --> 00:55:20.579 align:start position:0%
years ago that 70 percent of misuse in
 
00:55:22.609 --> 00:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
this country is actually done for to
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
treat a medical symptom not to get high
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
not to get a manage an addiction but to
 
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
actually treat a problem that's not
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
being treated otherwise
 
00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
um the reason why it was important to me
 
00:55:36.109 --> 00:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
number one that we Define misuse but use
 
00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:38.460 align:start position:0%
that term was that when you use the term
 
00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:42.020 align:start position:0%
abuse you're not including those who are
 
00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:44.220 align:start position:0%
self-medicating and I thought that those
 
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
people really needed to be included in
 
00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:47.940 align:start position:0%
both of these bills
 
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
um and then that brings us to harm
 
00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:50.450 align:start position:0%
um and then that brings us to harm
reduction

00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
um this was a very entertaining Journey
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
I've taken over the last couple of
 
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
months on this I've learned more in the
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
last couple months than I've learned
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
ever and in the end it's kind of like
 
00:56:01.849 --> 00:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
you Circle back right to where you were
 
00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
when you started I mean as a physiatrist
 
00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
we treat people with complex
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities we have complex disability
 
00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:09.829 align:start position:0%
disabilities we have complex disability
models

00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
models
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
and that involves a group of
 
00:56:13.609 --> 00:56:13.619 align:start position:0%
professionals working together as a team
 
00:56:16.609 --> 00:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
to help somebody achieve a goal
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
um that's functionally to me what harm
 
00:56:20.329 --> 00:56:20.339 align:start position:0%
reduction is it's prevention with a
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
group of people working together
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
integrative fashion to try to achieve a
 
00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
goal with using multiple modalities so a
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
prevention may be a single modality
 
00:56:30.589 --> 00:56:30.599 align:start position:0%
whereas harm reduction is using multiple
 
00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
modalities together so for example we
 
00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
have a statute on syringe exchange
 
00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
programs here they don't just exchange
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
needles they have to do all sorts of
 
00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
other things they have to provide
 
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
infectious disease counseling they have
 
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
to provide drug counseling they need to
 
00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:46.140 align:start position:0%
provide access to other services so
 
00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
they're doing a lot of things together
 
00:56:49.849 --> 00:56:49.859 align:start position:0%
and that in fact would be considered
 
00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:51.740 align:start position:0%
harm reduction
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
however the word was not defined and so
 
00:56:58.010 --> 00:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
I felt that it needed to be defined one
 
00:56:59.630 --> 00:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
of the thoughts that I had that I think
 
00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
is going to happen anyways that I think
 
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
should happen is that we sit down as a
 
00:57:04.849 --> 00:57:04.859 align:start position:0%
group and figure out how that should be
 
00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
defined the terms that we use on Page
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
Six in this the amended bill
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
that's taken directly from the samsa
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
website substance abuse mental health
 
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
Services Agency or Administration
 
00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
we took that directly from there and
 
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
I've I've done some symposia nationally
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
with people from samhsa before I have a
 
00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
lot of faith in them
 
00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:30.839 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of thought that went
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
into that definition and that's where we
 
00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
took that from it's like verbatim from
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
their website
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
um I think that perhaps that it would be
 
00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
a good idea after the discussion we just
 
00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:42.839 align:start position:0%
had and that I've talked with
 
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards and others that
 
00:57:48.109 --> 00:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
I think a further discussion and
 
00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
clarification would be helpful
 
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.069 align:start position:0%
clarification would be helpful
um

00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
um but it's a start and and maybe not a
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
finish but I think it's important that
 
00:57:58.790 --> 00:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
by January we have a finish
 
00:58:00.829 --> 00:58:00.839 align:start position:0%
because this is really important not
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
just for people that suffer from
 
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
addiction disorders but also from people
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
in pain that are not getting the
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
treatment they need
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
and I think the only other thing I will
 
00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
say is on the CME requirement that's in
 
00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
this bill I think it's page five
 
00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
um I I actually amended that and the
 
00:58:22.609 --> 00:58:22.619 align:start position:0%
reason uh maybe it's page six
 
00:58:24.589 --> 00:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
page five yeah
 
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
so the reason why we amended it is that
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
it already exists both in statute and um
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
in rules
 
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:32.990 align:start position:0%
in rules
um

00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
but there is a new requirement that all
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh anybody that has a DEA license has to
 
00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
have an eight-hour course on addiction
 
00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:42.200 align:start position:0%
and pain
 
00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
so that part is really
 
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
probably unnecessary
 
00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
um I would leave that to others who are
 
00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
more knowledgeable about legislative
 
00:58:54.289 --> 00:58:54.299 align:start position:0%
processes than I am to decide that but
 
00:58:58.730 --> 00:58:58.740 align:start position:0%
at this point I think that's unnecessary
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
um I think I'm done thank you
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative all very informative I do
 
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
have just one question to kick this off
 
00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
um when you say pain are you talking
 
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
physical mental emotional or are there
 
00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
other categories I'm missing could you I
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
guess break down the word pain for us so
 
00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:18.780 align:start position:0%
um that is it absolutely a great
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
question so we just started a committee
 
00:59:23.569 --> 00:59:23.579 align:start position:0%
on integrative care in New Hampshire and
 
00:59:25.789 --> 00:59:25.799 align:start position:0%
we decided to spend our first two work
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
group sessions on defining pain the
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
International Association for the study
 
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
of pain brought together experts from
 
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
all over the world to answer that
 
00:59:37.809 --> 00:59:37.819 align:start position:0%
question what we're taught I mean
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
we look at pain from a lot of different
 
00:59:40.079 --> 00:59:41.630 align:start position:0%
we look at pain from a lot of different
perspectives

00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
perspectives
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
um nociception is a is like I pinch my
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
skin that sends a signal to my brain
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
that something hurts that's no
 
00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.390 align:start position:0%
that something hurts that's no
susception

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
susception
 
00:59:52.609 --> 00:59:52.619 align:start position:0%
what that means to me at the brain level
 
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:55.140 align:start position:0%
can be something very different like for
 
00:59:57.530 --> 00:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
example I treated a patient years ago
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
that had a ruptured Achilles tendon
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
which hurts but it's very treatable
 
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
in his culture severing an Achilles
 
01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.230 align:start position:0%
in his culture severing an Achilles
tendon

01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
tendon
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
um was a punishment by God in his
 
01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
religion and so he was devast it was his
 
01:00:15.049 --> 01:00:15.059 align:start position:0%
faith and he was devastated by this
 
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
injury Way Beyond what you would expect
 
01:00:20.329 --> 01:00:20.339 align:start position:0%
that's suffering to separate those two
 
01:00:23.329 --> 01:00:23.339 align:start position:0%
every what we've understood for over 70
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
years is every symptom has has an
 
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
emotional element to it too so it's not
 
01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:30.780 align:start position:0%
really a good idea to separate the two
 
01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
so everything has a nociceptive element
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
every pain element has a suffering
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
element and it's important that we
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
recognize that and a spiritual element
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that I think that
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
we're focusing on is we also look at
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
pain from a time element so there's like
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
an acute pain like I pinched my arm here
 
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
I'm wearing sneakers because I got
 
01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:52.859 align:start position:0%
plantar fasciitis and I got lucky enough
 
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
didn't have to run Mount Washington two
 
01:00:56.650 --> 01:00:56.660 align:start position:0%
weeks ago which I was supposed to do
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's more of an acute pain nociceptive
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
thing I I hope otherwise I'm really
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
really suffering now because I didn't
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
get to do the race but anyway
 
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:07.380 align:start position:0%
um but that would be an acute pain
 
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
element we talk about perioperative care
 
01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
post-operative care we talk about a
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
thing called acute pain chronically that
 
01:01:16.849 --> 01:01:16.859 align:start position:0%
we use in talking with NFL players where
 
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
you're just constantly injuring yourself
 
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
over and over again but it's all
 
01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
nociceptive and then we talk about
 
01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
chronic pain which is pain that's kind
 
01:01:27.049 --> 01:01:27.059 align:start position:0%
of a time element more that we Define
 
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
that as greater than three months but
 
01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.049 align:start position:0%
that as greater than three months but
that

01:01:30.049 --> 01:01:30.059 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
that basically will include a central
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
component that's both suffering
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
emotional and peripheral we're not
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
including I'm a Buffalo Bills fan we've
 
01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
had season tickets for 60 years the
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
suffering that I deal with and not
 
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
watching them when a Super Bowl every
 
01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
year is not what we're talking about so
 
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:50.460 align:start position:0%
this opioid abatement money and the
 
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
governor's commission money would not
 
01:01:53.809 --> 01:01:53.819 align:start position:0%
include me
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
um and then we talk about the term
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
serious pain which I really don't like
 
01:02:00.410 --> 01:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
but that's the term that's used it's
 
01:02:03.289 --> 01:02:03.299 align:start position:0%
like palliative care hospice care what
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
we're struggling with is do we include
 
01:02:07.789 --> 01:02:07.799 align:start position:0%
them and what we're talking about here
 
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
and there's reasons to do it and there's
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
reasons not to do it but that that would
 
01:02:14.809 --> 01:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
be another discussion if you want
 
01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
very good thank you we're going to go
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative Weber for a question and
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:23.569 --> 01:02:23.579 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman was very narrow
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
and it went back to the bottom of page
 
01:02:28.569 --> 01:02:28.579 align:start position:0%
five with the uh licensing requirement
 
01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh you said that perhaps not needed
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
because now eight hours on pain
 
01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
management is is required
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
um is it helpful or not helpful to have
 
01:02:42.349 --> 01:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
the specific requirement of three hours
 
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
of harm reduction
 
01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:47.700 align:start position:0%
that's included in that because they're
 
01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
they're one is a subset of the other but
 
01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:53.220 align:start position:0%
could be left out
 
01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
um because we don't really have any
 
01:02:57.049 --> 01:02:57.059 align:start position:0%
statute that addresses education and
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
addiction that I'm aware of
 
01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
um it may be a good idea to do that
 
01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
and refer to addiction medicine harm
 
01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
reduction whatever the way the statutes
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
um written now it could be either or but
 
01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
the eight hour requirement does include
 
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
addiction I I don't really know the
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
details of what they're requiring that
 
01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
you teach I don't I don't think harm
 
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
reduction by itself is in that okay
 
01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:25.609 align:start position:0%
reduction by itself is in that okay
clarification

01:03:25.609 --> 01:03:25.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Nagel I might
 
01:03:27.599 --> 01:03:28.630 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Nagel I might
have

01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:30.839 align:start position:0%
misunderstood something here so please
 
01:03:32.289 --> 01:03:32.299 align:start position:0%
indulge me
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
I know that um this has been incredibly
 
01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
controversial we've voted on
 
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know two three four iterations
 
01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
of a definition of harm reduction
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
already and we're still not there
 
01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
somehow so we're trying to make it
 
01:03:52.450 --> 01:03:52.460 align:start position:0%
as narrow and tight as possible
 
01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
to make it less controversial to
 
01:03:55.079 --> 01:03:56.150 align:start position:0%
to make it less controversial to
actually

01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:03:59.030 --> 01:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
um have broader consensus and acceptance
 
01:04:02.349 --> 01:04:02.359 align:start position:0%
but I heard you talk about
 
01:04:06.370 --> 01:04:06.380 align:start position:0%
opioid refugees and people who ended up
 
01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
essentially purchasing
 
01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
illegal medications or medications that
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
are legal but purchasing them on the
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
street because they can't get them and I
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
thought I heard you say that these this
 
01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
activity should be included in in the
 
01:04:27.370 --> 01:04:27.380 align:start position:0%
definition of harm reduction as well
 
01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:30.740 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if that's the case
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
number one how that would be worded and
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
number two how that would ever pass
 
01:04:40.849 --> 01:04:40.859 align:start position:0%
muster and get consensus to be passed as
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
a part of a bill like this you know what
 
01:04:45.770 --> 01:04:45.780 align:start position:0%
I found really fascinating is that when
 
01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
I brought that issue up the people that
 
01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
were opposed to this bill started
 
01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:52.740 align:start position:0%
thinking this bill was a good idea
 
01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:04:59.690 --> 01:04:59.700 align:start position:0%
66 million people have chronic pain in
 
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
the United States
 
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
um about 50 25 million people
 
01:05:07.609 --> 01:05:07.619 align:start position:0%
have um what we call high impact chronic
 
01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
pain meaning that their quality of life
 
01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
is significantly deteriorated because of
 
01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
their pain
 
01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
um fewer than two million people have
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
opioid use disorder and and about 10 of
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
the population has a substance use
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
disorder of some sort so we're talking
 
01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
about numbers that are a lot bigger than
 
01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
other numbers are
 
01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
and and the money that we've taken
 
01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
from from Pain we've taken to substance
 
01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
use and we've kind of
 
01:05:35.089 --> 01:05:35.099 align:start position:0%
trying to think of a plate were to use
 
01:05:36.589 --> 01:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
but I just don't think it's really
 
01:05:38.329 --> 01:05:38.339 align:start position:0%
appropriate to adversely affect one
 
01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:40.140 align:start position:0%
group to help another group
 
01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
so that's why I think that that is what
 
01:05:45.049 --> 01:05:45.059 align:start position:0%
policy has done and that's why what I
 
01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:47.579 align:start position:0%
think we need to do is shift us back to
 
01:05:49.130 --> 01:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
the middle and we really need to find
 
01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
that middle ground so to answer your
 
01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:52.549 align:start position:0%
that middle ground so to answer your
question

01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:05:54.410 --> 01:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
um just a representative Edwards and I
 
01:05:57.049 --> 01:05:57.059 align:start position:0%
had this discussion and and he's of the
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
belief that that a provision of some
 
01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
sort should be added to the definition
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
of harm reduction but it glossary as you
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
suggested earlier but we use a separate
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
term for that group of people and not
 
01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
call it harm reduction
 
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
he he I can't remember the term he used
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
I I didn't like it but um
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
um I think we can do better but but his
 
01:06:20.569 --> 01:06:20.579 align:start position:0%
point was good and his point was the
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
same as yours yep to follow up I just
 
01:06:24.529 --> 01:06:24.539 align:start position:0%
think that to add that into the
 
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
definition of harm reduction would make
 
01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:30.059 align:start position:0%
this to a lot of people seem more Broad
 
01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:31.980 align:start position:0%
and more controversial and more
 
01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
difficult to actually get achieve
 
01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
consensus to get the bill passed and I
 
01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
really like your idea of a glossary
 
01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
because we've done that with every Bill
 
01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
I've ever written we had a glossary of
 
01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
all these terms in there and um and I do
 
01:06:47.569 --> 01:06:47.579 align:start position:0%
like the idea of what I'm proposing be
 
01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
in this bill but as a separate entity do
 
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
I I guess I would I would have to
 
01:06:59.329 --> 01:06:59.339 align:start position:0%
see what language was used and what it
 
01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
was you know how how it was incorporated
 
01:07:05.329 --> 01:07:05.339 align:start position:0%
I certainly think it would I'm not
 
01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
saying I disagree with you in any way
 
01:07:09.049 --> 01:07:09.059 align:start position:0%
I'm just thinking that if it was
 
01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
included in this definition of harm
 
01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:12.470 align:start position:0%
included in this definition of harm
reduction

01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
um it would just
 
01:07:13.799 --> 01:07:14.930 align:start position:0%
um it would just
um

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
make it more controversial rather than
 
01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:18.839 align:start position:0%
less controversial
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
um so I would you know if you have ideas
 
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
about language that would put it into a
 
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
different section of the bill
 
01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:28.370 align:start position:0%
different section of the bill
um

01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:30.289 --> 01:07:30.299 align:start position:0%
or if I could work on that with you I'd
 
01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
be glad to do that I think that will
 
01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
require some work and I'd be yeah this
 
01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:37.140 align:start position:0%
issue just came up like two days ago and
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
I thought at first I was kind of opposed
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
to it because I do think that it is harm
 
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.430 align:start position:0%
to it because I do think that it is harm
reduction

01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:47.700 align:start position:0%
but um I've talked to people to muddy
 
01:07:49.609 --> 01:07:49.619 align:start position:0%
the waters a lot I've talked to people
 
01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
from all over the country about this
 
01:07:53.930 --> 01:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
concept and there's like varying ideas
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
of what the topic even means and um
 
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
um I think you know the things that were
 
01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
handed out to us today were a great
 
01:08:04.849 --> 01:08:04.859 align:start position:0%
overview of and I think that's a general
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
consensus but you know when I talk to
 
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
some people that's not it at all and
 
01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro for a follow-up
 
01:08:15.289 --> 01:08:15.299 align:start position:0%
and then representative Weber yep I
 
01:08:17.689 --> 01:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
would just like to say you know as I
 
01:08:19.209 --> 01:08:19.219 align:start position:0%
mentioned before there have been many
 
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
iterations of this language that have
 
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
been discussed in our committee in
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
health and human services and um and
 
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
been voted on and been voted on in front
 
01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
of the house and I voted for all of them
 
01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
um because
 
01:08:34.329 --> 01:08:34.339 align:start position:0%
um in my mind
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
no matter how we no matter how tight we
 
01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
make the definition of harm reduction
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
number one we can't um predict what's
 
01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:44.339 align:start position:0%
going to come in the future so we can't
 
01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
it I don't understand how we can
 
01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
legislate a Prohibition prohibition of
 
01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
things we don't even know about yet and
 
01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
also I think there are many many other
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
guard rails besides this definition
 
01:08:58.729 --> 01:08:58.739 align:start position:0%
which will determine whether other
 
01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
activities are
 
01:09:04.930 --> 01:09:04.940 align:start position:0%
promoted allowed licensed in the future
 
01:09:07.849 --> 01:09:07.859 align:start position:0%
you have to get funding for things you'd
 
01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
have to get approval you'd have to get
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
them through regulations the legislature
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
could act on those new ideas when they
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
came up so I think there are other guard
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
rails aside from just this definition of
 
01:09:21.169 --> 01:09:21.179 align:start position:0%
harm reduction
 
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't disagree and I I we've
 
01:09:26.329 --> 01:09:26.339 align:start position:0%
this has prompted a lot of discussion
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
and one of the members of the governor's
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
commission and I hope she and I've been
 
01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
friends and dealt done this policy work
 
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
for a long time she said that it's
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
almost a non-definable term it's a
 
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.130 align:start position:0%
almost a non-definable term it's a
concept

01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
concept
 
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
and trying to define something that's
 
01:09:42.169 --> 01:09:42.179 align:start position:0%
non-definable will always create
 
01:09:42.179 --> 01:09:43.550 align:start position:0%
non-definable will always create
problems

01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
problems
 
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
um so I I do think that putting Minds
 
01:09:48.890 --> 01:09:48.900 align:start position:0%
together to really think this throughout
 
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
has a lot of value and we did suggest
 
01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
that I think as you recall in our
 
01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
committee right from the very beginning
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
that it was suggested that we actually
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
do what we looks like we're gonna end up
 
01:10:03.850 --> 01:10:03.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to explore a little bit
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the joys of serving on
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services this year has
 
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
been access to you and your knowledge of
 
01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
uh program of problems that
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
I have seen small pieces of in my life
 
01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:27.780 align:start position:0%
um as as somebody who who had a a spouse
 
01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
die of cancer and all the pain
 
01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
management issues that come with that uh
 
01:10:36.189 --> 01:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
and then as an issue of public policy
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that I love is
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
exploring the global
 
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
view that you're talking about here
 
01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:51.780 align:start position:0%
because one of the frustrations of
 
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
uh passing legislation that I have is
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
that we do tend to
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
look at small bites
 
01:11:00.719 --> 01:11:01.430 align:start position:0%
look at small bites
um

01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:05.209 --> 01:11:05.219 align:start position:0%
that having been said I do think that
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
one of the things that the committee as
 
01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
it deliberates further needs to do is to
 
01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
decide whether a bill that started out
 
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
as looking at a specific program
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
for one specific issue and therefore had
 
01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:27.030 align:start position:0%
a specific definition
 
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:31.030 align:start position:0%
a specific definition
[Music]

01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
tailored for that particular purpose
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
is the appropriate vehicle for a global
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
view of how we ought to be dealing with
 
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
an issue that we certainly are not
 
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:11:53.050 --> 01:11:53.060 align:start position:0%
enough in a global fashion so I I just
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh bringing the attorney mind to it
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
this actually is One Piece
 
01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
of a much larger puzzle and I'm not sure
 
01:12:08.689 --> 01:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
that trying to come up with a definition
 
01:12:10.930 --> 01:12:10.940 align:start position:0%
that encompasses
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
all of the different kinds
 
01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
of situations that don't relate to this
 
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
program is is necessarily going to be a
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
useful way of dealing with it and I just
 
01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to highlight that tension
 
01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:31.910 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to highlight that tension
and

01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.530 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:12:33.530 --> 01:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
welcome welcome your comments on it but
 
01:12:39.530 --> 01:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm concerned that we're trying
 
01:12:42.970 --> 01:12:42.980 align:start position:0%
possibly to
 
01:12:45.770 --> 01:12:45.780 align:start position:0%
in trying to be inclusive we're
 
01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
including things that don't actually
 
01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:50.090 align:start position:0%
including things that don't actually
um

01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:52.729 --> 01:12:52.739 align:start position:0%
belong in this statute because this
 
01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
statute was intended to be much narrower
 
01:12:58.729 --> 01:12:58.739 align:start position:0%
so any any comments you yeah
 
01:13:00.770 --> 01:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
this is why this whole thing was really
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
important to me
 
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
um 330 million dollars in opioid
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
abatement money I have a series of
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
programs that we would like to create
 
01:13:11.870 --> 01:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
that would help number one help people
 
01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:13.550 align:start position:0%
that would help number one help people
avoid

01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
avoid
 
01:13:15.649 --> 01:13:15.659 align:start position:0%
um people in pain avoid being on
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
long-term opioid therapy but you know
 
01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
integrative care things like that the
 
01:13:20.330 --> 01:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
things that nobody in this country is
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
doing well
 
01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
and and then secondly how do we deal
 
01:13:25.729 --> 01:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
with patients that once they're on
 
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
opioid therapy
 
01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
um how do we help them if they've if
 
01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
they've been abandoned how do we help
 
01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:34.010 align:start position:0%
they've been abandoned how do we help
them

01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
I want them to have access to that 330
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
that's why it was important to me that
 
01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
they get included in this legislation
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
because that is what this legislation is
 
01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:45.780 align:start position:0%
about it's about the governor's
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
commission and the opioid abatement
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
commission I share your concerned
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
because the definition I believe is
 
01:13:52.490 --> 01:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
going to go in the control Drug Act if
 
01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
I'm not mistaken and then all of a
 
01:13:56.209 --> 01:13:56.219 align:start position:0%
sudden you've taken a definition that's
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
going to go
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
you know viral to use a
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
colloquial term that that concerned me
 
01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
you know misuse I think should be in the
 
01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
controlled Drug Act I I'm not sure if
 
01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
harm reduction should be
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
um I think that is more germane to this
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
that help
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Waters you wanna
 
01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:26.510 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
and I just this is as much for Dave or
 
01:14:30.410 --> 01:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel um it seemed to me
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
on Page Six
 
01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
line 13 and 14. that the definition that
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
you developed here
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
that this is an important line drug
 
01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
misuse refers to the substance
 
01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:44.340 align:start position:0%
here's a substance for a purpose that's
 
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
not consistent with legal or medical
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines and I I think that's awfully
 
01:14:50.330 --> 01:14:50.340 align:start position:0%
important because it does recognize what
 
01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
has been said about
 
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
we need we need to be able to prescribe
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
to folks
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's important there
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
but I think the bifurcation in the bill
 
01:15:01.490 --> 01:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
is that that that's a good placeholder
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
for things you're talking about and I do
 
01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
think the governor's commission you know
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
has actually some programs right now
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
that are funded about education on on on
 
01:15:12.649 --> 01:15:12.659 align:start position:0%
on on you know what the consequences for
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
folks who are using opioids for pain
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
reduction and then problems develop oh
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
good this the student High School the
 
01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
highest the student athlete program we
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
fund all through our schools is exactly
 
01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
on that so I think I think that's an
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
important thing I think actually it
 
01:15:32.209 --> 01:15:32.219 align:start position:0%
really is a placeholder for you there
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
I think that it's important because of
 
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
the question of Representative Shapiro
 
01:15:39.290 --> 01:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
raised that we're not that harm
 
01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
reduction is not going to mean that
 
01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
somebody who can't get a Percocet
 
01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:44.689 align:start position:0%
somebody who can't get a Percocet
um

01:15:44.689 --> 01:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:47.149 --> 01:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
subscription anymore from their doctor
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
can go to a syringe exchange site and
 
01:15:53.209 --> 01:15:53.219 align:start position:0%
get percocet no you know harm reduction
 
01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
are the things here and I think you
 
01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
agree with that but I I just I think
 
01:15:58.850 --> 01:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
that's why because of the question that
 
01:16:00.649 --> 01:16:00.659 align:start position:0%
came up that I think the clarity here
 
01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
and what representative Weber was saying
 
01:16:04.370 --> 01:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
too is that we have a lot more to do
 
01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:07.140 align:start position:0%
about opioids about prescription about
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
all these other things but about harm
 
01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:10.550 align:start position:0%
all these other things but about harm
reduction

01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
we know we can save some lives if we
 
01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
recognize and and do what we need
 
01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
legislatively around the programs that
 
01:16:21.649 --> 01:16:21.659 align:start position:0%
we're we're working on so I didn't mean
 
01:16:23.450 --> 01:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
to interrupt but I just think that that
 
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
was a Clarity that you actually had put
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
something in here that really your your
 
01:16:29.689 --> 01:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
primary concern there and read his book
 
01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
you know it's a good book um but uh
 
01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
title written down you know but that's
 
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
why I want to point that out Madam chair
 
01:16:38.770 --> 01:16:38.780 align:start position:0%
and thank you
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
that was perfect no that was awesome and
 
01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
I think you you also raised that same
 
01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
issue that maybe we should be defining
 
01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
this separately you know and I think
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's perfect for this bill what you
 
01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
have in there is is good thanks
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you both thanks for the plug
 
01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
anything further for uh representative
 
01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
Nagel all right thank you very much for
 
01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
uh being here and letting your knowledge
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
with us also today uh representative
 
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
soloway representative Hannon if you
 
01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
would both um like to say some words or
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
comments on this bill now would be the
 
01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:15.590 align:start position:0%
comments on this bill now would be the
time

01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
um for the record

um I am Jeffrey salloway a former
 
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
representative from the town of Lee
 
01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
um and uh sat on a committee on Health
 
01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:31.860 align:start position:0%
and Human Services uh LED at various
 
01:17:34.490 --> 01:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
times by representative Weber and I'm
 
01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
going to speak uh briefly
 
01:17:43.010 --> 01:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
um to uh uh s wage uh representative
 
01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
Nagel's feelings about medical education
 
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
I am the author of uh two volume set
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
when I was teaching in medical schools
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
one of which was epidemiology of drug
 
01:17:56.530 --> 01:17:56.540 align:start position:0%
and alcohol abuse and the second was
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
epidemiology of treatment of drug and
 
01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
alcohol abuse those are available on
 
01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
Amazon under the antiquarian no
 
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
collectible value section
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
um I I want just to speak briefly to the
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
bill I am basically in favor of the bill
 
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
however I want to speak about paradigm
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
shift this bill is I think the first
 
01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
step in a paradigm shift in the way that
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
we deal with substance misuse I do not
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
believe that it goes nearly far enough I
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
believe completely with representative
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
Weber that there is much more to be done
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
there are major pieces that are missing
 
01:18:40.970 --> 01:18:40.980 align:start position:0%
you are aware that we do not attend to
 
01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:41.890 align:start position:0%
you are aware that we do not attend to
alcohol

01:18:41.890 --> 01:18:41.900 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
misuse and
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
70 percent of the substance misuse in
 
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
this country is based in alcohol uh one
 
01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
in 10 Americans are alcoholic and we
 
01:18:58.490 --> 01:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
simply move on without attending to that
 
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
so it's necessary that we take a look at
 
01:19:05.689 --> 01:19:05.699 align:start position:0%
the whole issue of substance misuse and
 
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
change our paradigms some of you may be
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
familiar with the work of the historian
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
Barbara touchman she wrote a book called
 
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
the march of folly and in that book she
 
01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
talks about campaigns social military
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
political that have been launched
 
01:19:25.130 --> 01:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
through history when the perpetrators of
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
those campaigns knew full well that they
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
risked abject failure and forged ahead
 
01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
anyway into abject failure we sent a
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
copy of that to Vladimir Putin I don't
 
01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
believe that he read the book
 
01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
um we need to take a look at the work of
 
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
Edwin sure
 
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
s-c-h-e-r uh who wrote on drug abuse in
 
01:19:52.610 --> 01:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
Britain and America
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
that book was published over 50 years
 
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
ago in which he said if America is to
 
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
deal with substance misuse problems it
 
01:20:04.729 --> 01:20:04.739 align:start position:0%
has to decriminalize the use of those
 
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
substances in the way that the British
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
have decriminalized decriminalized it
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we do not do is
 
01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:15.719 align:start position:0%
to destroy the market for illicit
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
substances by making them available
 
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
under prescription and with supervision
 
01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:23.450 align:start position:0%
under prescription and with supervision
um

01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's necessary to change our entire
 
01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
approach to decriminalize to understand
 
01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
that in the words of our Stratford
 
01:20:34.490 --> 01:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
County sheriff and our Stratford County
 
01:20:36.770 --> 01:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
attorney you cannot deal with this
 
01:20:40.010 --> 01:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
problem by arresting it out of existence
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
we have to change the Paradigm I'm
 
01:20:46.850 --> 01:20:46.860 align:start position:0%
privileged today to have uh to my right
 
01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative a former representative
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
Joe Hannon I must say it is to my far
 
01:20:54.410 --> 01:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
right that uh representative Heenan is
 
01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:55.970 align:start position:0%
right that uh representative Heenan is
here

01:20:55.970 --> 01:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:20:59.090 --> 01:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
um and he has much more experience than
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
I do with um
 
01:21:04.750 --> 01:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
boots on the ground in Stratford County
 
01:21:08.689 --> 01:21:08.699 align:start position:0%
he has a long history of identifying
 
01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
ways to deal creatively with substance
 
01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
misuse and with your kind permission
 
01:21:15.890 --> 01:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I'd like to turn it over to
 
01:21:17.930 --> 01:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
him for his wisdom
 
01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you welcome former
 
01:21:21.649 --> 01:21:21.659 align:start position:0%
representative Hannan
 
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:25.010 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
um

01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:27.770 --> 01:21:27.780 align:start position:0%
so as you heard from the senator earlier
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
I was involved in the syringe exchange
 
01:21:31.370 --> 01:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
legislation for the programs uh I was
 
01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
also the chair of the commission to
 
01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
study New Hampshire syringes
 
01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:35.090 align:start position:0%
study New Hampshire syringes
um

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
I was a founding member of the harm
 
01:21:40.490 --> 01:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
reduction group that started a lot of
 
01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
this original syringe service programs
 
01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
and up until about four months ago I was
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
actively involved in uh going out and
 
01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:48.659 align:start position:0%
actually doing the work on the streets
 
01:21:50.570 --> 01:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
and the side of the road and wherever we
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
were doing the syringe work I'll just
 
01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
fill you in a couple I'll answer some of
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
the questions that were brought up
 
01:21:58.250 --> 01:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
earlier uh the xylazine test strips they
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
do exist uh they're a little more
 
01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
expensive than the fentanyl test strips
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
but it's I'm sure the price will come
 
01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
down as it become more
 
01:22:08.930 --> 01:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
used uh they're about I saw the the
 
01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
quickest one the most recent one I saw
 
01:22:11.870 --> 01:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
is about two dollars and fifty some
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
cents per test strip fentanyl test
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
strips are about a dollar or less I
 
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
believe but that depends on bulk buying
 
01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:19.490 align:start position:0%
believe but that depends on bulk buying
um

01:22:19.490 --> 01:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
another thing uh is the uh the use of uh
 
01:22:25.729 --> 01:22:25.739 align:start position:0%
the definition of harm reduction
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
services and this is something that I've
 
01:22:30.530 --> 01:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
actually wrestled with with people in
 
01:22:31.729 --> 01:22:31.739 align:start position:0%
the organization that I used to be a
 
01:22:35.209 --> 01:22:35.219 align:start position:0%
part of what is harm reductions um what
 
01:22:37.490 --> 01:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
is harm reduction in the beginning uh it
 
01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
was just syringe Services that's all we
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
did we just wanted to get the syringes
 
01:22:43.610 --> 01:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
out there naloxone Narcan was a big part
 
01:22:45.229 --> 01:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
of that but obviously there's a lot more
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
to it there's no one definition if you
 
01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
look around uh different parts of the
 
01:22:51.169 --> 01:22:51.179 align:start position:0%
country uh in different certain service
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
programs or harm reduction groups there
 
01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
are basic principles that they all
 
01:22:58.010 --> 01:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
generally agree to
 
01:23:00.050 --> 01:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
um and one is that uh and they're in the
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
packet that was handed out I believe uh
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
harm reduction practices and evidence
 
01:23:04.970 --> 01:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
and educational resource for New
 
01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire decision makers I wasn't a
 
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
part of this
 
01:23:10.130 --> 01:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
uh publication but I was a part of some
 
01:23:11.330 --> 01:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:23:14.330 --> 01:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
um parts of it before it was formed
 
01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:15.169 align:start position:0%
um parts of it before it was formed
um

01:23:15.169 --> 01:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
a number one of the biggest things is it
 
01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
accepts the drugs use accepts drug use
 
01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
is part of our world and chooses to work
 
01:23:23.570 --> 01:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
to minimize its harmful effects rather
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
than simply ignore or condemn them so
 
01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
harm reduction is not promoting drug use
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
it's not trying to say you know hear
 
01:23:32.450 --> 01:23:32.460 align:start position:0%
some drugs you know good luck it's
 
01:23:33.770 --> 01:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
better that I'm giving you this that
 
01:23:35.209 --> 01:23:35.219 align:start position:0%
might be a part of something in a safe
 
01:23:37.130 --> 01:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
injection facility which by the way have
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
not had a single overdose death in a
 
01:23:41.810 --> 01:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
facility worldwide ever they've given
 
01:23:43.970 --> 01:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
millions of uh people have gone it
 
01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:45.719 align:start position:0%
millions of people have used in those
 
01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:47.699 align:start position:0%
programs not people but millions of
 
01:23:49.370 --> 01:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
times and no one has actually died
 
01:23:50.810 --> 01:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
because someone's there to take care of
 
01:23:53.050 --> 01:23:53.060 align:start position:0%
them some countries actually do
 
01:23:56.090 --> 01:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
Supply the substances but generally you
 
01:23:57.770 --> 01:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
bring your own you can use test strips
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
there's a sterile or clean area to use
 
01:24:02.330 --> 01:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
instead of having to use in a uh in a
 
01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
porta potty or in some alley somewhere
 
01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:06.649 align:start position:0%
porta potty or in some alley somewhere
people

01:24:06.649 --> 01:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
um are less likely to get infections
 
01:24:12.169 --> 01:24:12.179 align:start position:0%
die it's a very good option it's
 
01:24:13.970 --> 01:24:13.980 align:start position:0%
something that the opioid the governor's
 
01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:15.860 align:start position:0%
task for the commission was looking at
 
01:24:18.169 --> 01:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
peripherally when I was on it years ago
 
01:24:20.209 --> 01:24:20.219 align:start position:0%
and it's not a New Concept that they've
 
01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
been looking at the research is still
 
01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
ongoing and because there aren't that
 
01:24:25.490 --> 01:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
many of them around there's one in New
 
01:24:27.050 --> 01:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
York there's a lot of legal issues with
 
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
it also because there's a federal
 
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
prohibition on having it in a facility
 
01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know if banning that
 
01:24:36.050 --> 01:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
concept is actually going to matter
 
01:24:38.450 --> 01:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
because it's not going to happen until
 
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
it gets passed into law anyway
 
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
so either way I think it's a you know
 
01:24:45.649 --> 01:24:45.659 align:start position:0%
extraneous Point uh if something that
 
01:24:46.850 --> 01:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
people are worried about I understand
 
01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
when the syringe service legislation was
 
01:24:50.630 --> 01:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
passed there was a Senator I'm not going
 
01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
to name names but who voted for it who
 
01:24:54.290 --> 01:24:54.300 align:start position:0%
said you know as long as they don't
 
01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
start uh you know putting uh safe
 
01:24:58.669 --> 01:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
injection places out there and I was
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
like well just be quiet you know it's
 
01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
probably going to happen eventually but
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
I I don't know when that's going to
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
happen I'm not a part of an effort right
 
01:25:06.530 --> 01:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
now to do that although I think it's a
 
01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
good idea to look into and uh to study
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
people aren't dying when they are
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
they're in a safe environment and
 
01:25:14.930 --> 01:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
someone can help revive them
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
um xylazine test strips it's also
 
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
something very no um it's a common sense
 
01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
thing the one thing that was brought up
 
01:25:25.090 --> 01:25:25.100 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
01:25:27.649 --> 01:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia was
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
um you know pipes and Cottons and I can
 
01:25:32.209 --> 01:25:32.219 align:start position:0%
answer any questions about specific
 
01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
items like if you're wondering were
 
01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
Cottons or use four cotton balls or
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
tourniquets they're they're used to
 
01:25:39.530 --> 01:25:39.540 align:start position:0%
Cotton their preparation equipment it's
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
things that people use to prepare the
 
01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
heroin or fentanyl usually now
 
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
um or any other injectable drug to
 
01:25:50.930 --> 01:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
inject it more safely uh previous uh
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
historically people and still people do
 
01:25:55.130 --> 01:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
this they would use cigarette butt
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
filters and because you have to actually
 
01:26:00.410 --> 01:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
draw the syringe through a spoon or a
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
cooker of some kind after they heat it
 
01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
up and kind of purifies it to a degree
 
01:26:05.570 --> 01:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
but it helps get rid of the bigger
 
01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
chunks that might be in there so you're
 
01:26:08.209 --> 01:26:08.219 align:start position:0%
not injecting something into a vein and
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
causing an infection or death so it is
 
01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
something that is is is is it's actually
 
01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
as important or more important than when
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
you go get a flu shot and they swab your
 
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
arm with alcohol you're creating uh one
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
thing that lessens the harm for sticking
 
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
a needle in the human body so cotton
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
balls tourniquets they help the veins
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
during the injection process cookers
 
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
little uh they're not we don't give out
 
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
spoon bent spoons but they would have
 
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
little teacup little things that have
 
01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
little handles and people can safely
 
01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
cook and dispose of things without
 
01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
sharing the same cooker over and over I
 
01:26:45.649 --> 01:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
talked to several people who have are
 
01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
currently in recovery who had previously
 
01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
used who got hepatitis from sharing
 
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
cookers they said I'm using clean
 
01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
needles I don't know how I got hepatitis
 
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
well they all took a clean needle and
 
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
kept putting it into the same they all
 
01:26:58.490 --> 01:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
had their own needles but they were
 
01:27:00.410 --> 01:27:00.420 align:start position:0%
putting into the same cookers so they're
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
an integral part of preventing HIV
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
hepatitis and the spread of other
 
01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
infectious diseases and just general
 
01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:09.060 align:start position:0%
well-being like I said nobody is
 
01:27:11.090 --> 01:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
condoning and saying it's a good idea to
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
do any drugs whatsoever drugs have their
 
01:27:13.679 --> 01:27:14.990 align:start position:0%
do any drugs whatsoever drugs have their
purpose

01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
um like the doctor was saying you know
 
01:27:18.169 --> 01:27:18.179 align:start position:0%
opioids have a role and I think it's
 
01:27:20.930 --> 01:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
important to to realize that heroin had
 
01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
a role medically at one point many of
 
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
the drugs on this schedule one list
 
01:27:27.530 --> 01:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
actually do have medical uses they're
 
01:27:30.530 --> 01:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
just vilified and not legal in the at
 
01:27:32.450 --> 01:27:32.460 align:start position:0%
the federal level so you know that is
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
changing I think over time I I don't
 
01:27:35.209 --> 01:27:35.219 align:start position:0%
know if it's going to happen in New
 
01:27:36.169 --> 01:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire until it happens at the
 
01:27:37.850 --> 01:27:37.860 align:start position:0%
federal level but I think it's important
 
01:27:39.709 --> 01:27:39.719 align:start position:0%
to realize that the preparation
 
01:27:41.810 --> 01:27:41.820 align:start position:0%
equipment and pipes and things like that
 
01:27:44.689 --> 01:27:44.699 align:start position:0%
are very necessary to prevent infections
 
01:27:47.689 --> 01:27:47.699 align:start position:0%
and other things now the actual law says
 
01:27:50.330 --> 01:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
um you know attempt to be a part of a
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
comprehensive service program that may
 
01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
include as appropriate providing sterile
 
01:27:55.610 --> 01:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
needles syringes and Other Drug
 
01:27:57.229 --> 01:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
preparation equipment and Disposal
 
01:27:59.330 --> 01:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
Services so drug preparation equipment
 
01:28:01.729 --> 01:28:01.739 align:start position:0%
is kind of peripherally included in
 
01:28:04.129 --> 01:28:04.139 align:start position:0%
what's allowed now one thing that people
 
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
and I see this often and many people in
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
volunteers and people even working for
 
01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
syringe service programs is in New
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they think that you know you
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
can't get arrested if you're a part of a
 
01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
syringe service program it's actually
 
01:28:16.129 --> 01:28:16.139 align:start position:0%
not true the way the original law was
 
01:28:17.570 --> 01:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
written and still is I believe correct
 
01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
me if anyone knows differently it's it
 
01:28:21.890 --> 01:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
went from a felony to have a residual
 
01:28:24.290 --> 01:28:24.300 align:start position:0%
amount of uh illicit substance in a
 
01:28:27.770 --> 01:28:27.780 align:start position:0%
syringe or around it a non-usable amount
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
is what we're trying to find but a trace
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
amount and that used to be a felony so
 
01:28:34.189 --> 01:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
seven years in jail we made it a
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor so if you have an unusable
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
amount of drugs in a syringe it's a
 
01:28:39.890 --> 01:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and if you are a part of a
 
01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
volunteer worker or a participant of a
 
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
syringe service program that's licensed
 
01:28:46.370 --> 01:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
that's recognized by New Hampshire you
 
01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
have an affirmative defense if you get
 
01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
arrested for that possession so
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
technically every time I was out there
 
01:28:53.689 --> 01:28:53.699 align:start position:0%
they could have arrested me I wish they
 
01:28:55.250 --> 01:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
would because that would be a great PR
 
01:28:57.709 --> 01:28:57.719 align:start position:0%
stunt but um you know it never happened
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
I tried
 
01:29:01.310 --> 01:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
um you know most often the police know
 
01:29:03.169 --> 01:29:03.179 align:start position:0%
what's going on and they they don't
 
01:29:06.410 --> 01:29:06.420 align:start position:0%
interfere they may not like it but the
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
biggest thing is that because it was
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
made a misdemeanor no prosecutor is
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
going to waste their time just
 
01:29:12.890 --> 01:29:12.900 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting a possession charge when
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
they could go after them for fentanyl
 
01:29:16.430 --> 01:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
possession or deal or you know
 
01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
distribution all kinds of other charges
 
01:29:21.770 --> 01:29:21.780 align:start position:0%
so the idea was to to destigmatize those
 
01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
those items uh and it's hard because I
 
01:29:26.330 --> 01:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
rely is that Law Enforcement wants to
 
01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
use them as pieces of evidence or as
 
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
probable cause to make an arrest for
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
something else I understand that's a
 
01:29:34.129 --> 01:29:34.139 align:start position:0%
part of it but it's you know if you see
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
a diabetic in a car sticking a needle in
 
01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
their belly or in their arm you know
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's not pro it's not cause to arrest
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
that person
 
01:29:44.570 --> 01:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
but you'd want it almost seems like they
 
01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
they want something to arrest them for
 
01:29:48.110 --> 01:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a dangerous road to
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
go down I think they should all be
 
01:29:51.890 --> 01:29:51.900 align:start position:0%
um allowed as far as preparation and
 
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
safe uh you know if whether you're
 
01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:54.900 align:start position:0%
legalizing the substance or not it's a
 
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
different discussion but as far as the
 
01:29:58.010 --> 01:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
things that prevent illness infection
 
01:30:00.530 --> 01:30:00.540 align:start position:0%
and make the use which is probably
 
01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
happening anyway whether we like it or
 
01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
not to make it safer and less harmful I
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
think is very important and I don't want
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
to go on forever because I could but
 
01:30:09.709 --> 01:30:09.719 align:start position:0%
I'll just to say one or two real quick
 
01:30:12.050 --> 01:30:12.060 align:start position:0%
things and I'll answer any questions
 
01:30:13.490 --> 01:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
um another there's principles of harm
 
01:30:14.689 --> 01:30:14.699 align:start position:0%
reduction that are listed here I won't
 
01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
go all through all of them but one of
 
01:30:20.810 --> 01:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
them says you know ensures that pwid PW
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
UD people who use drugs have a real
 
01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:24.179 align:start position:0%
voice in the creation of programs and
 
01:30:27.410 --> 01:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
policies designed to serve them
 
01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
um so I I know that the commission is
 
01:30:31.370 --> 01:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
supposed to have I think uh I can't
 
01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
remember two num two members from the
 
01:30:34.370 --> 01:30:34.380 align:start position:0%
harm reduction Community or one from
 
01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
prevention one from harm reduction uh it
 
01:30:39.290 --> 01:30:39.300 align:start position:0%
says professionals a lot of times there
 
01:30:42.050 --> 01:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
were volunteers and now it's a lot less
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
volunteers than it used to be we had a
 
01:30:45.890 --> 01:30:45.900 align:start position:0%
it was predominantly all volunteer run
 
01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:47.639 align:start position:0%
for a long time and they've seemed to
 
01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
have done away with that over time
 
01:30:52.669 --> 01:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
um very educated there were doctors
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
nurses paramedics who are these
 
01:30:56.330 --> 01:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
volunteers uh now there's some very
 
01:30:58.490 --> 01:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
qualified and experienced people who are
 
01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
gaining experience but uh you know
 
01:31:04.149 --> 01:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
the idea is to have someone who is
 
01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
involved in the community and can and it
 
01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:08.940 align:start position:0%
affects them more directly than just
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
someone who's volunteering or working
 
01:31:12.110 --> 01:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
for them so people who use drugs and
 
01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
this is something that was talked about
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
in one of the opioid tasks for I was on
 
01:31:16.490 --> 01:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
the opioid task force years ago and it
 
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
was talked about getting someone
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
involved who's actively using drugs to
 
01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
be involved in making policies I realize
 
01:31:25.250 --> 01:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
that's a difficult thing to do because
 
01:31:27.169 --> 01:31:27.179 align:start position:0%
sometimes they may or may not show up
 
01:31:29.209 --> 01:31:29.219 align:start position:0%
and I know it's a stereotype but it
 
01:31:31.189 --> 01:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
became a it's a reality sometimes we've
 
01:31:32.750 --> 01:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
tried to get people to show up but I
 
01:31:34.129 --> 01:31:34.139 align:start position:0%
think it's important to include people
 
01:31:37.010 --> 01:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
who whether they're actively using or or
 
01:31:39.229 --> 01:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
in recovery at the very least should be
 
01:31:40.850 --> 01:31:40.860 align:start position:0%
involved in the process and I think that
 
01:31:43.010 --> 01:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
should be something that could easily be
 
01:31:44.810 --> 01:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
um be added
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:48.239 --> 01:31:49.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:51.770 --> 01:31:51.780 align:start position:0%
uh as far as the definition I think it's
 
01:31:53.450 --> 01:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
it's going to be really hard to make a
 
01:31:55.129 --> 01:31:55.139 align:start position:0%
definition but I think it's important to
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
to keep the focus
 
01:31:59.330 --> 01:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
um to actually have a focus I mean
 
01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
prevention is a big amorphous term we
 
01:32:02.689 --> 01:32:02.699 align:start position:0%
don't definition we don't really Define
 
01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
specifics of prevention
 
01:32:07.250 --> 01:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
um and and even recovery it's evolving
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's an evolving field but I do think
 
01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
that uh harm reduction is something that
 
01:32:14.570 --> 01:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
from my experience uh the definition can
 
01:32:16.010 --> 01:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
be whatever you want it to be and so can
 
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
recovery in in some senses I was part of
 
01:32:19.370 --> 01:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
a recovery organization and we said you
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
know you're in recovery when you say you
 
01:32:22.490 --> 01:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
are and if you're getting a bunch of
 
01:32:24.050 --> 01:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
doctors to say what is recovery and to
 
01:32:25.129 --> 01:32:25.139 align:start position:0%
come up with the definition it's very
 
01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
hard to do when people are saying you're
 
01:32:29.090 --> 01:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
in recovery when you say you are you
 
01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
know whether someone is using regularly
 
01:32:33.950 --> 01:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
or someone is completely abstinent it's
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
a Continuum and I think it's important
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
to recognize that people live on that
 
01:32:39.830 --> 01:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
Continuum sometimes and they may be in
 
01:32:42.350 --> 01:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
recovery someone who is using 10 bags of
 
01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
heroin a day is a very serious chronic
 
01:32:47.570 --> 01:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
user probably but they may be functional
 
01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
not judging it but I'm the goal for harm
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
reduction wouldn't be to say oh we're
 
01:32:53.149 --> 01:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
going to get them to stop it the first
 
01:32:54.649 --> 01:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
goal is to say we're going to help them
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
do it safely and not get sick and die
 
01:32:57.770 --> 01:32:57.780 align:start position:0%
because if they're sick even if they get
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
in recovery what's the point if they're
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
going to die
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
so we want to get people to the next
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
level we're not pushing people we don't
 
01:33:06.110 --> 01:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
coerce them we don't try to make them
 
01:33:09.169 --> 01:33:09.179 align:start position:0%
quit or do things the way we want them
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
to we give them what they need and then
 
01:33:14.689 --> 01:33:14.699 align:start position:0%
we show them Alternatives so pipes is
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
something that made the news everyone's
 
01:33:18.350 --> 01:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
so upset about these crack pipes and
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
smoking pipes out there it's an
 
01:33:21.709 --> 01:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
alternative to actually sticking a
 
01:33:24.050 --> 01:33:24.060 align:start position:0%
needle in your arm for many people so if
 
01:33:25.970 --> 01:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
the choice is do I stick a needle in my
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
arm or smoke something you know yes it's
 
01:33:30.050 --> 01:33:30.060 align:start position:0%
smoke might not be as good for the lungs
 
01:33:32.570 --> 01:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
but you're much less likely to catch a
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
bloodborne infection almost you know
 
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
drastically less so there are things
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
that have to be considered but I do
 
01:33:41.209 --> 01:33:41.219 align:start position:0%
think that you can't say harm reduction
 
01:33:43.970 --> 01:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
is or recovery is anything I say it is
 
01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
and then have that be part of policy so
 
01:33:49.010 --> 01:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
I think as far as the harm reduction of
 
01:33:50.570 --> 01:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
recovery world I think it's fine to have
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
those amorphous definitions because it
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
is evolving and people do relate
 
01:33:55.970 --> 01:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
differently and have different ideas but
 
01:33:57.530 --> 01:33:57.540 align:start position:0%
I think if you're going to have a policy
 
01:33:58.850 --> 01:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
where there's going to be money involved
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
and there's different political side
 
01:34:03.290 --> 01:34:03.300 align:start position:0%
someone on the far right of this former
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative and someone to my you
 
01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
know far left here
 
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
um you you have to be able to to make
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
that Focus somehow I'm not sure how to
 
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
do that and I'm I'm not here to give you
 
01:34:14.810 --> 01:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
all the answers I'm just here to you
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
know give some background and maybe help
 
01:34:19.490 --> 01:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
with the solution but um I think that's
 
01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:20.209 align:start position:0%
with the solution but um I think that's
um

01:34:20.209 --> 01:34:20.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:22.010 --> 01:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
I've talked enough I'd be happy to
 
01:34:24.050 --> 01:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
answer any questions if anyone has any
 
01:34:26.090 --> 01:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
um specifics about harm reduction or
 
01:34:29.090 --> 01:34:29.100 align:start position:0%
about uh safe injecting or anything
 
01:34:30.590 --> 01:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
and if not I'll be quiet you can go to
 
01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
lunch thank you we do have one
 
01:34:34.850 --> 01:34:34.860 align:start position:0%
representative Weber for question
 
01:34:36.649 --> 01:34:36.659 align:start position:0%
I just had drafting question
 
01:34:36.659 --> 01:34:38.270 align:start position:0%
I just had drafting question
specifically

01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
um you were talking about uh including
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
the perspective of a person who has used
 
01:34:45.770 --> 01:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
drugs and uh with the term lived
 
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
experience be appropriate for that yes
 
01:34:51.770 --> 01:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay that might be easier and
 
01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:53.330 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay that might be easier and
also

01:34:53.330 --> 01:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:34:55.010 --> 01:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
um then you're not defining sorry then
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
you're not defining whether they're
 
01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
still actively using because someone
 
01:34:59.390 --> 01:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
might know well it's it's much broader
 
01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
but it does uh recognize that
 
01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
none of us who have not been in that
 
01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:07.870 align:start position:0%
none of us who have not been in that
position

01:35:07.870 --> 01:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:35:10.729 --> 01:35:10.739 align:start position:0%
uh have the perspective
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
that somebody who has what
 
01:35:17.209 --> 01:35:17.219 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you anyone else
 
01:35:19.490 --> 01:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
all right appreciate that anyone in the
 
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
audience wishing to address this work
 
01:35:26.810 --> 01:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:28.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:35:31.610 --> 01:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
oh you have a question
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
01:35:35.209 --> 01:35:35.219 align:start position:0%
sure come right up looks like the mic's
 
01:35:37.790 --> 01:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
already on for you there at the table
 
01:35:39.770 --> 01:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
I think what you brought up was really
 
01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:41.810 align:start position:0%
I think what you brought up was really
important

01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
um but there's a way I this may be a
 
01:35:47.209 --> 01:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
sidebar conversation but like um having
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
a patient or a a client or a customer
 
01:35:51.649 --> 01:35:51.659 align:start position:0%
whatever you call them um involved in
 
01:35:54.290 --> 01:35:54.300 align:start position:0%
the process is critical and we've done
 
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
that with everything we've done but you
 
01:35:58.490 --> 01:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
vet who they are and you can and you can
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
get them but how we put that in
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
legislation is really important but I
 
01:36:04.729 --> 01:36:04.739 align:start position:0%
think in everything we do if we're going
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
to call it patient-centered you really
 
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
have to include
 
01:36:17.110 --> 01:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
real good
 
01:36:21.229 --> 01:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
um again anything further from the
 
01:36:23.209 --> 01:36:23.219 align:start position:0%
committee at this point okay oh
 
01:36:25.370 --> 01:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
01:36:28.010 --> 01:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
I I would just like to say that you know
 
01:36:31.129 --> 01:36:31.139 align:start position:0%
speaking about the specific Bill versus
 
01:36:35.330 --> 01:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
the broader societal and policy issues
 
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
um it's the whole issue of stigma and um
 
01:36:40.810 --> 01:36:40.820 align:start position:0%
I think we've frequently talk about
 
01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
stigma in you know in the mental health
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
field and in addictions and we want to
 
01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
reduce stigma because we want people to
 
01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:52.610 align:start position:0%
reduce stigma because we want people to
um

01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:52.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:56.410 --> 01:36:56.420 align:start position:0%
get treatment or use harm reduction
 
01:36:56.420 --> 01:36:58.090 align:start position:0%
get treatment or use harm reduction
methods

01:36:58.090 --> 01:36:58.100 align:start position:0%
methods
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
but for me personally this is the
 
01:37:02.330 --> 01:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
question of whether we want to do away
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
with stigma completely or to or the
 
01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
taboo about using alcohol and and
 
01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:09.709 align:start position:0%
taboo about using alcohol and and
um

01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
drugs because
 
01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
if we do away with it are we in some way
 
01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
making it
 
01:37:19.729 --> 01:37:19.739 align:start position:0%
making it the norm and encouraging
 
01:37:24.649 --> 01:37:24.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:27.709 --> 01:37:27.719 align:start position:0%
is generally harmful for their lives and
 
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
for the for society in general so I I
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
think that's kind of a big philosophical
 
01:37:34.250 --> 01:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
question but I think it's in some ways
 
01:37:36.410 --> 01:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
it's part of the subtext here because
 
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
when we talk about harm reduction I
 
01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:40.370 align:start position:0%
when we talk about harm reduction I
think

01:37:40.370 --> 01:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
some people immediately jump to what
 
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep people healthier and
 
01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
safer and um prevent deaths and then
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
other people jump to are we making this
 
01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
kind of a normal activity and in that
 
01:37:57.590 --> 01:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
way encouraging people and so I think
 
01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's an important balance that we need
 
01:38:05.050 --> 01:38:05.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:07.370 --> 01:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:38:10.490 --> 01:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
and just as a follow-up to that I I have
 
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
been having a certain amount of angst
 
01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
over a suggestion I made earlier which
 
01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:17.030 align:start position:0%
over a suggestion I made earlier which
was

01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:17.709 align:start position:0%
was
um

01:38:17.709 --> 01:38:17.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
putting using his brackets the the end
 
01:38:24.910 --> 01:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
point of nothing she'll create a a safe
 
01:38:29.330 --> 01:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
injection site and I will I'm now
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
thinking because I reread the end of the
 
01:38:34.810 --> 01:38:34.820 align:start position:0%
bill as it stands now
 
01:38:37.550 --> 01:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm thinking that that might better
 
01:38:40.370 --> 01:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
go up where we already have the limited
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
to language because I love the fact that
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
this bill ends currently with promote a
 
01:38:49.129 --> 01:38:49.139 align:start position:0%
philosophy of Hope and healing by
 
01:38:51.169 --> 01:38:51.179 align:start position:0%
utilizing those with lived experience of
 
01:38:52.729 --> 01:38:52.739 align:start position:0%
recovery in the management of harm
 
01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
reduction services and connect those who
 
01:38:57.110 --> 01:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
expressed interest to treatment peer
 
01:38:59.209 --> 01:38:59.219 align:start position:0%
support workers and other recovery
 
01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:01.679 align:start position:0%
Support Services I love the idea of
 
01:39:04.689 --> 01:39:04.699 align:start position:0%
ending on a note of Hope
 
01:39:07.729 --> 01:39:07.739 align:start position:0%
and I realized that that may be
 
01:39:09.709 --> 01:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
incompatible with good legal drafting
 
01:39:13.810 --> 01:39:13.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:16.860 align:start position:0%

01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
know how much time it takes to watch a
 
01:39:24.770 --> 01:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
bill go through the process and uh
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%

01:39:27.950 --> 01:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
present possibly even
 
01:39:30.410 --> 01:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
um duplicatively from what you've said
 
01:39:32.270 --> 01:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
previous at other hearings so we really
 
01:39:35.450 --> 01:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I'm going to close this
 
01:39:38.209 --> 01:39:38.219 align:start position:0%
work session on Senate Bill 239 it will
