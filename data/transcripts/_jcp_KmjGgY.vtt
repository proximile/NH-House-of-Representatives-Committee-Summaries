the uh
 
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
first bill that we're talking about is

an advocate for special education
 
00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
this is a new office
 
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to admin
 
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.430 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to admin
services

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
under the direction of advocate for
 
00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
special education
 
00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:53.990 align:start position:0%
special education
so

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
do i have anyone here that would like to
 
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
it's like i guess that means we can
 
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
italia is that
 
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
certainly i have a question
 
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.189 align:start position:0%
certainly i have a question
um

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
it says
 
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
in the rep and the committee report says
 
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
we already have
 
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
an office of a child advocate but it
 
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the authority to take any
 
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
action but then it says if this pat this
 
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
passes we're going to have an
 
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
advocate for special ed
 
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
but but that office will not have the
 
00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
authority to intervene either so
 
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
am i reading this correctly or so what
 
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
what will this new advocate do
 
00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
is that a good question
 
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
can we hear from representative luno
 
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 align:start position:0%

he's on education
 
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 align:start position:0%

director sanchez the office of a child
 
00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
advocate was particularly compelling um
 
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
that office is uh responsibilities have
 
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
recently been expanded by the executive
 
00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
branch to include education and its
 
00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
director sanchez's plan
 
00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh to bring forward in the next budget
 
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
a a request for um uh for uh an
 
00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 align:start position:0%
education advocate you know as part of
 
00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:40.710 align:start position:0%
education advocate you know as part of
that

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
that office
 
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
according to
 
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
her testimony and according to the
 
00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
testimony that was offered by
 
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
her predecessor uh in that position
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.589 align:start position:0%
the um
things

00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
of doing it through the office of the
 
00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
child advocate would be approximately
 
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
three hundred and seventeen thousand
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
dollars off the bill's fiscal note of
 
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand dollars so um sort
 
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
of you know just sort of rounding that
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
um the office of child advocate can do
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
it for about two hundred thousand as
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
opposed to five hundred thousand which
 
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
is what's proposed in um in
 
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
senate bill 381 i think beyond that
 
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.589 align:start position:0%
senate bill 381 i think beyond that
though

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
um the um
 
00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
for this bill was uh was interim study
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:36.150 align:start position:0%
and um
and

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
and the um
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
the committee the the minority report on
 
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
that really did cite i think significant
 
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.029 align:start position:0%
that really did cite i think significant
flaws

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
flaws
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
in uh in the the 381 policy uh which uh
 
00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
which wouldn't provide any authority to
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
do anything um uh you know in terms of
 
00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
intervening with the students um you
 
00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
know iep
 
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.469 align:start position:0%
know iep
uh

00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know it would have no um
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
you know appeal author no appellate
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
authority nothing like that so um
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
so you know so i think um
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
i think an interim study recommendation
 
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
is good i think an itl recommendation um
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
is good and um and i'm i'm i'm sorry
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
that uh that director sanchez isn't
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
isn't here i don't want to you know
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
speak for her i certainly can't
 
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.990 align:start position:0%
speak for her i certainly can't
but

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
but i think i'm representing her um her
 
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
um very impactful
 
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.230 align:start position:0%
um very impactful
um

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh uh testimony from from at least um uh
 
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago i think i'm reflecting
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
that accurately
 
00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:41.670 align:start position:0%
that accurately
so

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
if i'm understanding what what you're
 
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.030 align:start position:0%
if i'm understanding what what you're
saying

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.550 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.750 align:start position:0%
it's
probably

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
probably better that we itl it
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
miss miss sanchez
 
00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:00.550 align:start position:0%
miss miss sanchez
come

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
come
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
in with a request for a bill
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
for next year to place this under
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
the child advocate
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
yeah good move and i and her her
 
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
intention is to do that through the
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
budget process and um she already has
 
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
authority for this in this area and um
 
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
and would uh would seek budget authority
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay not a significant savings
 
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.350 align:start position:0%
okay not a significant savings
yeah

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
when i read it's
 
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's very uh convoluted and
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
i certainly
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
am not real thrilled about the child
 
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.590 align:start position:0%
am not real thrilled about the child
advocate

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
going to das but
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
that's just another right
 
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
another issue that i happen to have yes
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
represent lynn thank you uh thank you
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
for taking my question i i i completely
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
agree with you that that what you
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
suggest makes more sense than what the
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
bills as the way its traffic suggests
 
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
but i have a more fundamental question
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
and that is this
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
it seems like we've we've started to go
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
down the road with the office of child
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
advocate and you know i guess at the
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission for a long
 
00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:17.839 align:start position:0%
time we've had a consumer advocate of
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
setting up
 
00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:20.949 align:start position:0%
setting up
within

00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
within
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
agencies or sometimes without agencies
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
uh a section that uh you know ex
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering if that
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
i guess the analogy i would draw is
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it make more sense to have
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
within say the department of health and
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
human services and the department of
 
00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.550 align:start position:0%
human services and the department of
education

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
kind of an internal affairs section like
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
they do with the state police or police
 
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
department that if somebody
 
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
is screwing up in the agency then that's
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
what internal affairs does but it's
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
within the agency and usually they have
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know a reporting situation so that
 
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
you know if you're if if uh
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
if the sergeant in the police department
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
is the person that's under investigation
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
then the internal affairs doesn't report
 
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
to that sergeant even if they normally
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
would have to
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
so that wouldn't it make more sense to
 
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
do something like that
 
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
just as as a general matter of operating
 
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
government than to have these new
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
agencies that you know are supposed to
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
are supposed to like look at the other
 
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.790 align:start position:0%
are supposed to like look at the other
agencies

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
no you're you're absolutely correct
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
judge and and um and we did hear
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
testimony uh to that uh to that very
 
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
effect the department of education does
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
actually have uh an internal affairs um
 
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
element that's responsible for special
 
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
education and special education appeals
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
when when a family does not feel that uh
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
that that their student that their child
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
has been
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
you know properly represented uh during
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
the iep process and
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh and i i believe in the in the prior
 
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.230 align:start position:0%
uh and i i believe in the in the prior
year

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
that um that there were approximately
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing it jump out of my notes
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
but i
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
seem to remember the number being
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
between 30 and 35
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
appeals that were adjudicated through
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
the through the department of of
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
education i think that's sort of like a
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
an annual sort of
 
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
number so they do have that process i
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
think as far as the office of child
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
advocate as opposed to the office of the
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
special education advocate right the
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate would
 
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:31.990 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate would
would

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
by by by now having jurisdiction that
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
has been expanded to include education
 
00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
and staffing appropriately for that
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
would would give them a more complete
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
ability to uh to provide child advocacy
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
services across the state
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
both both in terms of
 
00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:50.389 align:start position:0%
both both in terms of
of

00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
you know health and human services you
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
know components as well as department of
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
education components so i think that
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
really does complete uh or you know help
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
make more complete the office of child
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
advocate role well thank you for a
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up so so i know i i mean i i i
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
think i agree with you i mean maybe it's
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
maybe it's we you know we've we've
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
already established the office of child
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
advocates so maybe
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
you know it's kind of too late to go
 
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
back and and and undo that but
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
and and so for that purpose maybe it
 
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
does make sense to and just give them a
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to include education i
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
guess i'm just sort of thinking that
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
down the road i hope we're not going to
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
be establishing any more such agencies
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
right right and that's an argument and
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
and the oca argument that i was just
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
making that's for a year from now it's
 
00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
not it's not today's debate so thank you
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
by the way it's representative lynn i
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
know he i just
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:52.310 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
i certainly understand representative
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
and we all have to remind ourselves all
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:05.189 --> 00:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
well we're a little bit more formal in
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
our meetings here but uh yes i agree
 
00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:11.430 align:start position:0%
our meetings here but uh yes i agree
okay

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
anything else no i think i think yeah
 
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.150 align:start position:0%
anything else no i think i think yeah
sure

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
thank you i think i understand but i
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clear up um
 
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
that there you know there's already
 
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
internal workings for this that this is
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
focused on the child not the agency
 
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
nothing you know what's going on in the
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
agency itself can you give an example of
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
what's not being done now that this
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the uh the question
 
00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.550 align:start position:0%
thank you for the uh the question
representative

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm i'm not really it's it's not
 
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
clear from the from the
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
what this person's authority would would
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
be it is it is clear from the bill that
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
they don't have the authority to
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
to make an appeal decision or anything
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
like that the way
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
the department of education
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
does and has
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
and does every year
 
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
in these cases
 
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.910 align:start position:0%
in these cases
okay

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
so representative turcotte did you have
 
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
a motion
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
unless there are any further questions
 
00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
or comments
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
i'll make a motion to interim study not
 
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.910 align:start position:0%
i'll make a motion to interim study not
itl

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
itl
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
if somebody else wants to make an itl or
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
may i just ask a question of
 
00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
representative turca sure
 
00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not at all a quote i'm just
 
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
wondering if you uh i mean what you're
 
00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
what you're thinking is on i may agree
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
with you i'm just not
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
well somebody just asked the last
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
question as to what this um
 
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
what the individual would have the
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
authority to do and it is it's pretty
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
well delineated under duties and
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
responsibilities actually what that
 
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
individual would do
 
00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:58.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:00.389 align:start position:0%
 
speak

00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:01.509 align:start position:0%
speak
really

00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:02.959 align:start position:0%
in detail to it
 
00:16:02.959 --> 00:16:05.670 align:start position:0%
in detail to it
but

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:07.839 align:start position:0%
such as things have the authority to
 
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
inquire of investigate review all
 
00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:11.839 align:start position:0%
documents from any school district
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
special ed blah blah blah the advocate
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
shall have access to all iap documents
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
401 plans
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
discretion to
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
tracking metrics i mean there is a lot
 
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:23.759 align:start position:0%
of things in there i i agree that i'm
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
not convinced this is something we need
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
but i'm also not quite to the point now
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
that i think i want to make an itl
 
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
do i have a second
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
i'll second it
 
00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:43.509 align:start position:0%
i'll second it
okay

00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.629 align:start position:0%
go ahead
um

00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
i thought the preference was to itl so
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
that i knew could because a new bill
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
will be coming in with with the budget
 
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:09.039 --> 00:17:09.909 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
i just
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
i just don't think
 
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.270 align:start position:0%
i just don't think
that

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
um interim study
 
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
puts us in a situation of trying to make
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
policy right
 
00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:25.750 align:start position:0%
policy right
and

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.150 align:start position:0%
 
if

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
the education committee had
 
00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:31.669 align:start position:0%
the education committee had
thought

00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
interim study was the right thing to me
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
that's the right place for it
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
not not that i uh
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
not that i mind making education policy
 
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.549 align:start position:0%
not that i mind making education policy
but

00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:17:42.559 --> 00:17:44.150 align:start position:0%
but
yet

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
but i i think that if in fact the child
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
advocate has the authority to do this
 
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.470 align:start position:0%
advocate has the authority to do this
already

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
that it simply makes sense
 
00:17:55.919 --> 00:17:56.870 align:start position:0%
that it simply makes sense
for

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
that to occur
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
and um i know that
 
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
that will not come to division two next
 
00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.990 align:start position:0%
that will not come to division two next
year

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:08.549 align:start position:0%
but um
because

00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
child advocate
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
is not part of our
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
of our
 
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.990 align:start position:0%
of our
menu

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
menu
 
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.870 align:start position:0%
menu
so

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
anyhow okay
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
go ahead yeah and
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
and honestly the the only reason why i'm
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
i've kind of changed my tune a little
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
bit as i was i was reading the uh the
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
blurb on it from
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
house calendar 15
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
and the majority of the committee was
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
and it did pass the house
 
00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:42.070 align:start position:0%
and it did pass the house
um

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
i'm just not comfortable making the itl
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
motion if somebody else would if we vote
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
this down if somebody else wants to make
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
okay will you call the role on interim
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
study unless there's some other comment
 
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
no it would the only comment i was going
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
to make is this i i will i am going to
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
vote for interim study but i should also
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
say if if but
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
if the consensus is that
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
interim study is inappropriate and
 
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
somebody else makes motion to itl i will
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
vote for that also
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
oh you want it both
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
i want it both ways yeah he sounds he
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
sounds just like a lawyer
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:29.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
all right uh this is a
 
00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
motion for interim study on senate bill
 
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.870 align:start position:0%
motion for interim study on senate bill
381

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%

representative bucca no
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%

representative umber
 
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
no i'm sure the vote is
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
five it's a
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
two to five in the negative so it does
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:09.350 align:start position:0%
 
second

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
are there any comments
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
on itl
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
represent murray i just uh really
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate what you said uh regarding us
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
not doing the policy part of it
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
and that it makes a lot more sense for
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
education to do their job or whoever is
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
going to do their job to put this
 
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
together and bring it back in a budget
 
00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.310 align:start position:0%
together and bring it back in a budget
year

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
but i don't what would we do to interim
 
00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.669 align:start position:0%
but i don't what would we do to interim
study

00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
as we're not the education committee
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
we could cut thank you yes
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
we could
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
we could cut the uh
 
00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
the money to zero you know
 
00:20:44.559 --> 00:20:46.470 align:start position:0%
the money to zero you know
that's

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
all right um so this is a uh oh just a
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
second was there anyone else
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.590 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%

yeah go ahead caitlyn would you we had a
 
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
discussion on friday and would you just
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
does this amendment do what i think we
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
agreed upon doing on friday
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
i believe it does so the discussion just
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
for the committee's memory and some of
 
00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
you were not here um was to
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
have costs associated with funding these
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
kids for fiscal year to 22 and 23 be
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
funded from the department of
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
education's budget
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
and on friday i pointed out to the
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
committee that there is excess
 
00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
appropriation for fiscal year
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
22 right now at about 1.4 million
 
00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.909 align:start position:0%
22 right now at about 1.4 million
dollars

00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
from a line in the state budget known as
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
state special education aid previously
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
known as catastrophic aid i mean that
 
00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.350 align:start position:0%
known as catastrophic aid i mean that
money

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
there is one additional use for that
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
money for the rest of this fiscal year
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
and then any additional funds
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
will lapse
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
so anything that would otherwise have
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
lapsed would now be retained by the
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
department to fund the costs
 
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
for kids
 
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.789 align:start position:0%
for kids
for

00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
these pupils for
 
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 and 23 only so it's a
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
one-time funding that the department of
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
education will pay for the costs
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
associated with these kids
 
00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.190 align:start position:0%
associated with these kids
and

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
that was because of the committee's
 
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
concern on fridays that school districts
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
have already set their budgets for
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 and 23 so they would not
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
have time to appropriate funding for any
 
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
additional costs associated with these
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
kids so that was the purpose of this
 
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.230 align:start position:0%
kids so that was the purpose of this
amendment

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
it would carry forward any money in the
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
end of fiscal year 22 and fiscal year 23
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
to assume to pay for these costs these
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
costs would be paid out um in 20
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24.
 
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
um because that that is the timing why
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
so um special education payments by the
 
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.909 align:start position:0%
so um special education payments by the
state

00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
usually are one year in arrears due to
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
will that present a hardship to school
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
districts well
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
let me ask first my first question is
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
to make the school districts whole
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
we would be paying the percentage
 
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
that the child who's turned 21
 
00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.950 align:start position:0%
that the child who's turned 21
um

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
the difference between the cat aide
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
percentage and the the full amount
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
would be covered by the school district
 
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
um under this amendment it would be
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
covered by the department of education
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
but without this amendment it would be
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
covered by the school district i'm sorry
 
00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:15.919 align:start position:0%
yes i'm at the department of bed all
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
right so it covers
 
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
the whole thing
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
i believe so yes all right
 
00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.029 align:start position:0%
i believe so yes all right
and

00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
my second question is my concern about
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
the local budgets
 
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
we're in 22 right now
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
next year is 23 and you just said it
 
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
won't be paid out until 24.
 
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
that is the way that all special
 
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
education funding works so um school
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
districts right now incur
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
for example for we're in school year 21
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
22 um if they have a high cost special
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
education child that costs say 200 000
 
00:27:53.919 --> 00:27:55.110 align:start position:0%
education child that costs say 200 000
um

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
this school district goes through the
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
entire year takes the kids ieps and all
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
the expenses associated with that ieps
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
and sends all that information to the
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
department of education by july 1st of
 
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
each year and then the
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement to pay that
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
payment is on january 1st of the
 
00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:15.039 align:start position:0%
following year so that is
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
the way the program is currently funded
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
uh representative he just
 
00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:20.950 align:start position:0%
uh representative he just
um

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
many school districts have
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
set aside capital reserve funds
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
this sort of this sort of thing right
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:34.950 align:start position:0%
and um
also

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.710 align:start position:0%
also
um

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.149 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
many school districts also when we
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
changed the law that allowed them to
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
you know keep the money that wasn't
 
00:28:45.919 --> 00:28:47.269 align:start position:0%
you know keep the money that wasn't
expended

00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
expended
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know they can
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
the school boards can authorize
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
this expense okay so it's it's not it's
 
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
not like
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
um the school's
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's not necessarily a zero-sum
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
game you know you know what i'm saying
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
the the money is
 
00:29:07.039 --> 00:29:08.310 align:start position:0%
the the money is
is

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
out there
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
as long as we have said in here some you
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
know that
 
00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:18.710 align:start position:0%
know that
um

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
they can spend it if necessary i i don't
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
i think this is sufficient the way it is
 
00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.830 align:start position:0%
i think this is sufficient the way it is
okay

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you yeah i apologize for not
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
being here friday i was at a weekend
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
where i've tested negative both times
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
but i'm still being cautious with my
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
mask um
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
at 22 what kicks in to continue to
 
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
support these students i'm what i'm
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
reading this is that there is a gap
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
between 21
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
and 22
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
um because this only goes up to 22. can
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
i just get a little briefer on so thank
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
you sure
 
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
so the previous um bill had
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
the previous law had the students
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
covered for special education up to 21.
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
this bill brings it up to 22. so what
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
had happened for students at 21 will now
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
happen at 22 they typically go into
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
a community agency or they're picked up
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
by community services to provide the
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
services that they need
 
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and um this was
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
this change as a result of a court case
 
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
there's a yes there's a court case in
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
rhode island that follows the federal
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
law which says inclusive of 21 and so
 
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
any state that hasn't does not have that
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
language is
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
potentially subject to that
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
represent petri
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chair uh thank you for
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question now what what
 
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
community services do
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
who who in community services takes care
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
of these kids because a matter of fact
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
we got some information from attorney
 
00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.029 align:start position:0%
we got some information from attorney
zellin

00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
zellin
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
that he used to say that at 21 they fall
 
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
off a cliff
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
so what's supposed to happen at 21 prior
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
to that actually is at 16 they're
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
supposed to be providing transition
 
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
services for students in the school and
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
they should be working with area
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
agencies to plan for that um exit at 21
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
22 whatever the the team has determined
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
and so they would work with area
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
agencies to get those services set up
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
for when they do exit um that does not
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
always happen but that's what's supposed
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
to happen there are 10 i believe 10 area
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
agencies that's run through dhhs but
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
there are 10 area agencies that provide
 
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
those services to developmentally
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
disabled um individuals now paul what
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
can you give me an example of some of
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
these agencies
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
that normally take care of these kids um
 
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
so in the lakes region there's lakes
 
00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
region community services um in concord
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
it is uh
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
i don't work with them so i
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
struggle with community
 
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh bridges maybe i think it's community
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
bridges yep oh okay um so those those
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
are some of the area agencies that i'm
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
familiar with and they cover the whole
 
00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.190 align:start position:0%
familiar with and they cover the whole
state

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
there yeah although those 10 different
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
agencies cover the state yes thank you
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
yeah we we have northern carroll county
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
no northern human services
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
that that covers our area
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
there's somebody in your area that is
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
also responsible for that
 
00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.029 align:start position:0%
also responsible for that
but

00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
as you said
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
the key is the coordination yes between
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
the school and the area agency
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
and you know so
 
00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
i think the um
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
takes care of
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
the problems that that we think we have
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
or that we know we have
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
yes um one other issue um and i i think
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
was attorney zelling brought it up or i
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
don't know if you brought it up about
 
00:32:55.679 --> 00:32:57.110 align:start position:0%
don't know if you brought it up about
our

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
our special education schools say up to
 
00:33:00.559 --> 00:33:01.669 align:start position:0%
our special education schools say up to
21

00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
21
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
do we need to amend anything in the
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
statutes about
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
like um spalding youth center or pi um
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
pinehaven i guess is one so our programs
 
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
are approved based off of what is the
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
current law so if the law were to change
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
then we would update those program
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
approvals for those schools
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
and that's this will take care of that
 
00:33:29.279 --> 00:33:32.149 align:start position:0%
and that's this will take care of that
okay

00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
representative lynn yeah i wonder
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
i apologize i was not i was here for the
 
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.190 align:start position:0%
i apologize i was not i was here for the
first

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
meeting when this topic was brought up
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
about the those court cases and that
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
kind of thing but then i wasn't here for
 
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
the meeting in which the more detail was
 
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
discussed so i guess the question that i
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure i'm understanding
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
is am i understanding that right now
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
the costs of special education
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
putting aside the
 
00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
the court case and the change that this
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
would make right now the cost of special
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
education there's essentially a sort of
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
sharing the state pays some of that but
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
the loc the the school district also
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
pays some is that correct
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
so we have um special education aid
 
00:34:12.879 --> 00:34:13.909 align:start position:0%
so we have um special education aid
provides

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
provides
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
funds to schools
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
if they meet um three times the cap and
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
the cap is set by the per pupil cost out
 
00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
of caitlyn's office and then once they
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
reach three times that cap the the state
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
will start to pay for
 
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
um 80 of their funds 80 of their bills
 
00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079 align:start position:0%
and then once you reach 10 times the cap
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
the state pays a hundred percent so this
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
the districts are required to pay a
 
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
portion right now the three times comes
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
out to just under seventy thousand
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
dollars um so they're required to pay a
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
portion but then we do kick in for some
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
of those um higher higher needs kids
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
with higher costs okay um uh follow me
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
ask a follow-up certainly
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
so i i guess the thing that i'm i'm not
 
00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
completely clearly understand is i mean
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
i don't get me wrong i completely agree
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
that we need to
 
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
you know that that we need to follow
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
what the court decision said and if we
 
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
should be providing special education
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
services up to 22 then we
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
then that's definitely what we should do
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
i guess the thing i have some
 
00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
difficulty understanding though is
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
i understand that school districts have
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
already set their budget
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
um but i'm not quite sure why that means
 
00:35:19.839 --> 00:35:20.710 align:start position:0%
um but i'm not quite sure why that means
that

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
the state should bear all the costs of
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
this in other words
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
you know why it's it's not sort of
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
the state's fault any more than it is
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
the school district's fault so why
 
00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:33.990 align:start position:0%
the school district's fault so why
should

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
you know why shouldn't we say look this
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
is just uh
 
00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities you have to pay
 
00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
your section your percentage of the
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
costs we understand that you may not
 
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
have foreseen this but you know you
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
there are times when
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
when a lot of things happen that you
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.589 --> 00:35:53.599 align:start position:0%
there was a proposal to the committee on
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
friday that the department of education
 
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
would pay that the department of
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
education then suggested the mechanism
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
of the funding in its current budget
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
that could
 
00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.630 align:start position:0%
that could
potentially

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
um pay for these costs but the proposal
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
for the state to pay originally came
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
from this committee okay all right
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
and also um
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
this was based on a court case
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
you know those terrible people
 
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
right yeah i know i understand that i
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
don't understand why that makes a
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
difference yeah and and the money was
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
available so it's not like we're um
 
00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
having to um
 
00:36:31.359 --> 00:36:32.310 align:start position:0%
having to um
spend

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
spend
 
00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.870 align:start position:0%
spend
money

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.870 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
yeah no i said okay if i may believe it
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
the intention is to cover those
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
unanticipated costs up to that cap so
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
that 70 thousand dollars and then that
 
00:36:45.599 --> 00:36:46.470 align:start position:0%
that 70 thousand dollars and then that
20

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
20
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
so it's not covering anything but that
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
70 000 is something a district has not
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
planned for so it's to try to assist
 
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
with that as we change this law more
 
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:55.599 align:start position:0%
quickly than we probably would have in a
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
different circumstance and i think i
 
00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:58.710 align:start position:0%
different circumstance and i think i
think

00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
rebecca said on friday that there were
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
four students
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.670 align:start position:0%
that are
21

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
21
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
up to 22
 
00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:10.950 align:start position:0%
up to 22
and

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
there were
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
yeah and there were 186
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
that are in the 20 age group
 
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
but they would have been budgeted for
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
because they weren't 21
 
00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:24.950 align:start position:0%
because they weren't 21
okay

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
more than likely will
 
00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:33.910 align:start position:0%
more than likely will
not

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.470 align:start position:0%
not
reach

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
reach
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
the 20
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
you know they could but
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
they could age they could turn 21 during
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
the year right and depending on the
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
school district the school district
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
could have planned for them to leave at
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
21. so it's to cover the cost from 21 to
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
the end of the year
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
or until they turn 22. yeah i mean it's
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
not like we're talking thousands of
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.950 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
do we have some
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
some estimate of what that cost will
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
it would be that that special education
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
aid cost so right now it's about it's
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
just under seventy thousand four seven
 
00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
twenty percent so if you're if there are
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
only four that are currently in it we're
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
talking four times seventy thousand okay
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
all right that makes a difference to me
 
00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.430 align:start position:0%
all right that makes a difference to me
okay

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative not a question for the
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%

we allow everyone
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%

once dropped mike into the well there
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
which was pretty embarrassing
 
00:39:29.119 --> 00:39:30.069 align:start position:0%
which was pretty embarrassing
um

00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
hi i'm jerry zellen i'm a lawyer drum in
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
woodson i represent uh school districts
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
particularly in matters involving
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
special education i'm wearing my
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
lobbyist bin but i'm not being paid by
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
anyone to be here today i also was not
 
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
paid for the but i spent my weekend
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
writing for you
 
00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:47.670 align:start position:0%
writing for you
um

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
i but i'm here because i think the
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
issues are important and um
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
i'm you have my letter and
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
as you if you read my letter you will
 
00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:58.550 align:start position:0%
as you if you read my letter you will
see

00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the um momentum for this
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
bill is driven by myths
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
um and so i'm going to uh for the sake
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
of time uh
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
focus my oral remarks on the myths that
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
have just been articulated this morning
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
if i may
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
um first of all there is the myth that
 
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
federal law and a court case demand
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
that we raise the age of special ed to
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
age 22.
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
now the federal statute does not
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
and in my memorandum i indicate
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
that federal law
 
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
creates a default raising the age of
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
special ed to the student's 22nd
 
00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.470 align:start position:0%
special ed to the student's 22nd
birthday

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
birthday
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
but then allows a state to um have a
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
lower cut off age
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
if that is consistent with the state's
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
regular education law so in other words
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the idea
 
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
at its heart is to open the schoolhouse
 
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
doors to children with disabilities by
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
allowing children
 
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
who um if they were not disabled could
 
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
attend school
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
to allow those children despite their
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
ability disability to be able to attend
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
school and so the heart of the dis the
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
special ed law is equality parity and
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire very clearly
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
guarantees regular ed only until the
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
21st birthday or receipt of a high
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
school diploma whichever occurs first
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire special ed law since
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
it was first enacted in 1978
 
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
has limited the
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
eligibility for special ed until the
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
21st birthday and no one challenged that
 
00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:40.710 align:start position:0%
21st birthday and no one challenged that
until

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
until
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
a decision by the first circuit came out
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
in 2018
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
that by a two to one vote
 
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
interpreted federal law
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
as requiring the state of rhode island
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
to offer special ed to the 22nd birthday
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
now why did the court reach that
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
conclusion the court looked very
 
00:42:05.109 --> 00:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
carefully at the idiosyncratic
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
attributes of rhode island system of
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
adult education
 
00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
and concluded that
 
00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
looking at that adult education system
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
in tandem with the idea
 
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
it seemed that the id that the rhode
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
island was offering regular education
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
up to beyond age 21
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
beyond the 21st birthday and therefore
 
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
um rhode island had to offer special
 
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
education beyond the 21st birthday now
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
that was a two to one decision
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
and um there's which illustrates how the
 
00:42:43.599 --> 00:42:44.390 align:start position:0%
and um there's which illustrates how the
idea

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
was ambiguous and it's very important
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
that the first circuit
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
when reaching that two to one decision
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
did not apply what the us supreme court
 
00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:54.790 align:start position:0%
did not apply what the us supreme court
said

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be applied when looking
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
at a federal
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
grant statute that's ambiguous
 
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
according to the u.s supreme court when
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
a federal grant statute's ambiguous the
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
quote rule of clear statement applies
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's supposed to protect federalism
 
00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:12.079 align:start position:0%
and states rights and according to the
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
u.s supreme court when a federal grant
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
statute's ambiguous it must be
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
interpreted narrowly to avoid
 
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
unanticipated consequences
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
and the problem is that the first
 
00:43:23.359 --> 00:43:24.470 align:start position:0%
and the problem is that the first
circuit

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
circuit
 
00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.750 align:start position:0%
circuit
never

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
never
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
cited that decision because the rhode
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
island board of education's lawyer never
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
cited it in his briefs i read his briefs
 
00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
it was shocking but nevertheless it
 
00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
since it was a two to one decision
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
that's not the end of the a that's not
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the analysis at the end
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
of the analysis because the the court by
 
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
reaching a two-to-one decision basically
 
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
conceded that the statute was ambiguous
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
um that should have triggered the u.s
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
supreme court's rule of clear statement
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
which meant well we interpret the stat
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
the uh statute narrowly rather than
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
broadly and i lay that out with
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
citations in my um
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
in my letter
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
a court
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
if the if the rhode island case
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
if the rhode island analysis continues
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
to apply if the first circuit got a case
 
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
and refused to
 
00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
correct its error in the kl case it
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
would still have to look at
 
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
the idiosyncrasies of new hampshire's
 
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
adult education law
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
and see if they are similar enough to
 
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
rhode islands or very different and if
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
you look at new hampshire's adult
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
education statute it caps eligibility at
 
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
age 21 at the 21st birthday
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
so i think that to say that the idea
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
demands special ed to age 22 is a house
 
00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
of cards
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
and to say that um the first circus
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
decision demand special ed to age 22 is
 
00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
a quite quite a leap of logic
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
i i agree as a policy matter it does
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
make sense to raise the age of
 
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
eligibility to sp um to 22
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
but um to say that it's compelled by
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
federal law is really uh
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
a a gross overstatement
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
the other concern i have is that um and
 
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
i hear i fear i'm looking a gift horse
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
in the mouth and i apologize but
 
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment does do school districts a
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
great favor by avoiding the budget
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
disruptions that will occur
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
if this bill becomes effective
 
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
immediately when school districts have
 
00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
not planned for that expense
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
on the other hand
 
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.109 align:start position:0%
on the other hand
this

00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment is just a short-term fix
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
and um once that that fiscal year ends
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
then school districts will be
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
fully funding these the costs of serving
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
this expanded population range and by
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
the way on the amendment the amendment
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
refers to
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
the school year pardon me the a
 
00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
particular school year which really
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't help answer
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
what happens with the ensuing summer the
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
summer of 2023
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
no matter how uh
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
wise a policy might be
 
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
the the um
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
the ends don't justify the means and we
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
have a provision in our new hampshire
 
00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:31.910 align:start position:0%
have a provision in our new hampshire
constitution

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
that prohibits new unfunded state
 
00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.750 align:start position:0%
that prohibits new unfunded state
mandates

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
and raising the age of eligibility from
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
21 to the 22nd birthday
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
would clearly be a new unfunded state
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
mandate now now the new hampshire
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
supreme court has chipped away at that
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
provision of our state constitution but
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
there's one provision that remains rock
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
solid and that was based on the first
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
decision by our new hampshire supreme
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
court interpreting that constitutional
 
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
amendment which is if you have a a
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
benefit program
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
mandated by state statute but funded by
 
00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
to any degree
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
by school districts or cities or towns
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
then expanding the population of
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries entitled to those benefits
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
is a violation of part one article 28a
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
of our new hampshire constitution unless
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
the state fully funds it
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
so um i'm here to urge you yes
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
raise the age
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
of special ed to a cap of the 22nd
 
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.069 align:start position:0%
of special ed to a cap of the 22nd
birthday

00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
birthday
 
00:47:40.079 --> 00:47:41.109 align:start position:0%
birthday
if

00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
you will fulfill the constitutional duty
 
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
of fully funding
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
the um all the special ed costs for
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
students between the ages of their 21st
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
birthday and their 22nd birthday and to
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
those who say well if we don't enact
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to face the costs of
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
litigation someone's going to
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
file a lawsuit raising the kl case um i
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
say to you two things
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
number one
 
00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:08.870 align:start position:0%
number one
the

00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
the recurring costs of
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
implementing this bill year after year
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
will far exceed the cost of litigating
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
whether kl applies to new hampshire
 
00:48:20.309 --> 00:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
and secondly
 
00:48:20.319 --> 00:48:21.030 align:start position:0%
and secondly
if

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:48:23.589 --> 00:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
school districts are commanded by this
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
statute to increase the population they
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
have to serve without full state funding
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
there will be a lawsuit by the school
 
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
districts and that too will be expensive
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
the last point i want to raise is this
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
and it's the interface with the area
 
00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:40.150 align:start position:0%
and it's the interface with the area
agencies

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:41.109 align:start position:0%
agencies
um

00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
the uh and thank you for bearing with me
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
for this but that my my my letter
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
explains the tragedy that occurs with
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
the following scenarios and i've seen
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
multiple cases like this
 
00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.870 align:start position:0%
multiple cases like this
recently

00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of health
 
00:48:59.349 --> 00:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
and human services has a policy
 
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
that if a student is in special ed then
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
adult services under rsa 171a are not
 
00:49:05.839 --> 00:49:07.670 align:start position:0%
adult services under rsa 171a are not
available

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
and so what we have is situations where
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
there are students older students in
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
special ed 18 19 20. uh their parents
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
raised them i mean these are kids who
 
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
have intellectual disabilities or autism
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
um their parents have raised them
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
since birth usually the dads bailed out
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
long ago
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
um the uh the child is now physically
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
larger than the mother
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
and um is out of control and the mother
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
or sometimes it's the grandmother um
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
who's been housing the child can no
 
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
longer deal with that child at home and
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
so what they do is they drop the child
 
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
at an emergency room
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
in a hospital or they just kick the
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
child out of the home
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
the child is homeless
 
00:49:55.119 --> 00:49:56.829 align:start position:0%
the child is homeless
now

00:49:56.829 --> 00:49:56.839 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
um we have juvenile statutes that are
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
intended to protect children who are
 
00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.390 align:start position:0%
intended to protect children who are
neglected

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
neglected
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
but those statutes don't apply unless
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
the neglect petition is filed before the
 
00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:08.559 align:start position:0%
child's 18th birthday
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
so we have no system to protect these
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
children that i'm just describing who
 
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
have passed age 18.
 
00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.069 align:start position:0%
have passed age 18.
now

00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
the school district does not have to
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
provide special education to them if
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
they're doing fine in their public high
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
school which is often the case the
 
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
school district has to provide a
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
residential placement when necessary for
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
the child to make meaningful educational
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
progress but i have multiple cases where
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
these children are doing fine in their
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
high school it's just that they have no
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
place to live because they've been
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
kicked out
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
of their homes
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
and school districts occasionally out of
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
sheer benevolence step in
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
and make a residential placement but the
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
residential placements they make have to
 
00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:53.430 align:start position:0%
residential placements they make have to
be

00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
residential schools in massachusetts
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
which is very very restrictive and
 
00:50:59.910 --> 00:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily expensive
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
the basic problem occurs because the
 
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
area agencies in the new hampshire
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
are saying if you are in special ed
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
while you're in special ed you're not
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
entitled to residential services from us
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
we won't offer you a community-based
 
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
group home that would allow you to
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
attend the local public high school
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
which you've been attending all along we
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
won't offer you a community-based foster
 
00:51:22.319 --> 00:51:23.190 align:start position:0%
won't offer you a community-based foster
home

00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
if you are going to prolong eligibility
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
for special ad you are going to prolong
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
that tragedy by giving the area agencies
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
an extra year to run away from these
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
children which is scandalous
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
now the amendment begins to attack that
 
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
issue but really doesn't solve the
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
problem it says the provision of
 
00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.309 align:start position:0%
problem it says the provision of
services

00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
um does not preclude the area agency
 
00:51:55.599 --> 00:51:56.950 align:start position:0%
um does not preclude the area agency
from

00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
the provision of special ed does not
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
preclude the
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
area agency from
 
00:52:05.109 --> 00:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
providing services but i i i'm
 
00:52:07.349 --> 00:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that
 
00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
gets us all the way we want to go it um
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
i'm putting myself in the position of
 
00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.470 align:start position:0%
i'm putting myself in the position of
dhhs

00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
and the area agencies they have their
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
policy if you're in special ed we won't
 
00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
provide services until you're out of
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
special ed
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
the the amendment seems to be saying
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
well the mere fact that you're
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
in special ed does not
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
preclude you from providing services
 
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
but does it require that they provide
 
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
services that's the question that i have
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
in my mind i would be much more
 
00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.109 align:start position:0%
in my mind i would be much more
happy

00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
happy
 
00:52:44.549 --> 00:52:44.559 align:start position:0%
that if
 
00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
there was some more affirmative
 
00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.190 align:start position:0%
there was some more affirmative
statement

00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
that the provision of special ed is not
 
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
a basis for dhhs and its area agencies
 
00:52:58.829 --> 00:52:58.839 align:start position:0%
to refuse to provide services under rsa
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
171 a
 
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
when those services qualify under rsa
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
oh no
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
certainly so um next
 
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
first of all thank you very much for
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
your time i mean this turn this in my
 
00:53:18.309 --> 00:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
mind anyway presents an entirely new
 
00:53:20.549 --> 00:53:20.559 align:start position:0%
light on this issue that i was not and
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i didn't have a chance to
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
i didn't see your letter until just now
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
i i tried to skim through it quickly but
 
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much it really turns an
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
entirely different light on this um i
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
just i guess i have a couple of
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
questions if i may
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
certainly uh first do you know uh the
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
the kl decision was that was there any
 
00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
requests made by you know somebody in
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
that litigation either for rehearing in
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
banc or to go to the supreme court there
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
was not a petition for certiorari to the
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
supreme court there was a request for
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
rehearing on bonk and when i when i
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
learned of the decision i contacted
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
rhode island's lawyer and said
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
you didn't cite pennhurst
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
and he did file for onboard uh rehearing
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
but again did not cite penhurst
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
okay okay so all right and so that the
 
00:54:07.839 --> 00:54:08.790 align:start position:0%
okay okay so all right and so that the
um

00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
so the um
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
has uh has um
 
00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
as far as you know has anyone
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire said that there's
 
00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:21.670 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire said that there's
some

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:23.430 align:start position:0%
some
idiosyncratic

00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
idiosyncratic
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
idiosyncrasy about the way new hampshire
 
00:54:26.079 --> 00:54:27.270 align:start position:0%
idiosyncrasy about the way new hampshire
treats

00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
treats
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
um special education that we have some
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
adult education law that allows people
 
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
to get
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
you know that they automatically are
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
qualify or something in some way that
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
that would be analogous to rhode island
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
well people have made noises about that
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
but when you ask them to be
 
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh specific
 
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
the ones that the specifics are when
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
you're looking at what is a state law or
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
state policy not what individual
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
adult education programs might do when
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
you look at state law the the states
 
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
the state board of education's rules
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
offer adult education
 
00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:03.750 align:start position:0%
offer adult education
um

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
to the people who would qualify under
 
00:55:05.599 --> 00:55:06.710 align:start position:0%
to the people who would qualify under
rsa

00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
189 colon one and then 189 colon one is
 
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
a statute that requires school districts
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
to provide regular education until the
 
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
21st birthday
 
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
so um yet uh i don't i don't think
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
that's quite correct
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
well i'm i'm welcome to be correct it's
 
00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
until you receive your degree
 
00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
not until you're 21.
 
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
well well it's until
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
well new hampshire's regular ed statute
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
is until you reach age 21 or receive
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
your degree whichever occurs first yes
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
okay so it's it's
 
00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:44.150 align:start position:0%
okay so it's it's
not

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.230 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh sb 394 is written when you look at it
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
in the context of other special ed laws
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
it would guarantee special ed until the
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
22nd birthday or receipt of a high
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
school diploma whichever occurs first
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
but with the population we're looking at
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
those severe disabilities
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
um if they haven't gotten diploma by age
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
20 if they haven't earned a diploma by
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
their 21st birthday then generally
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
they're not going to earn one by their
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
22nd birthday
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
i just had one other point of fiscal
 
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
point um
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
and i apologize for going on so long um
 
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's quite all right uh
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
when i looked at the fiscal impact
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
statements that accompanied these bills
 
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
they were very very flawed and the
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
reason why i say that
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
the children we're dealing with fall
 
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
into three categories
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who are attending their
 
00:56:43.829 --> 00:56:43.839 align:start position:0%
local public high schools
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
but those kids can be very expensive i
 
00:56:47.829 --> 00:56:47.839 align:start position:0%
had a case recently where
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
that child was getting what are called
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
transition services while the public
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
high school is costing the school
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
district eleven thousand dollars a month
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
for those transition services to
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
supplement the classes the child was
 
00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
taking at the high school
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
and then there are students who because
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
of the severity of their disabilities or
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
the shortcomings of their high school
 
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
programs require placement in
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
specialized day schools um
 
00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:14.799 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
those are called out of district day
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
placements and then there are some
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
who um because of the uh
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
severity of their disabilities or the
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
lack of an appropriate day program
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
within commuting distance of home
 
00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:30.799 align:start position:0%
are placed by school districts and
 
00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:32.799 align:start position:0%
private residential schools which
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
generally tend to be schools in
 
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
massachusetts that'll cost 200 to 300
 
00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.069 align:start position:0%
massachusetts that'll cost 200 to 300
000

00:57:38.069 --> 00:57:38.079 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
annually per child
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
now the um
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact statement there's
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
there was a pair of bills 394 senate
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
bill 394 in house bill 1513.
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
one of them looked exclusively at the
 
00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:54.870 align:start position:0%
one of them looked exclusively at the
children

00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
in residential placements when coming up
 
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
with a fiscal impact statement
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
the other one looked at kids in
 
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
out-of-district placements both day in
 
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
residential schools outside their public
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
high school
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
when coming up with a fiscal impact
 
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
statement however neither fiscal impact
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
statement includes the children
 
00:58:18.789 --> 00:58:18.799 align:start position:0%
who are receiving special education in
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
their local high schools even though
 
00:58:23.349 --> 00:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
those children are very expensive now
 
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps the department of education has
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
shared with you information not in the
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact statements
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
that capture that population of special
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
education children who are attending
 
00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
their local high schools
 
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
but the fiscal impact statements
 
00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:40.789 align:start position:0%
but the fiscal impact statements
themselves

00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative petrie yeah thank you
 
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for being here uh
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
and uh you made us uh you had a white
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
paper in
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
early 2000 probably around 11
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
on kids falling off a cliff
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
and now we find that this community
 
00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:04.230 align:start position:0%
and now we find that this community
services

00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
that uh help with that
 
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
kids keep from falling up maybe they're
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
just falling off a hill now
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
but uh do you think the situation has
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
improved and you think this bill would
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't uh
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
help the situation
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
well i i think this bill
 
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
i think this bill could hurt the
 
00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:24.799 align:start position:0%
situation by um allowing the area
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
agencies to run away from these kids for
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
another year
 
00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:29.910 align:start position:0%
another year
um

00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
my thought was the the long-term
 
00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:34.390 align:start position:0%
my thought was the the long-term
solution

00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:59:37.349 --> 00:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
is for the benefit of the children
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
is to have
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
a study commission as one of the compa
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
the bills has it but to add to the study
 
00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
commission's list of duties
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
to look at the relationship
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
between special education
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
and rsa 171-a
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
so that we have
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
smooth hand-offs and coordination i mean
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
here is one of the crazy ways the system
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
works okay um
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
school districts have to provide
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
transition services that are designed to
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
prepare children for life once they exit
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
special education
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
what often happens is that the school
 
01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
district doesn't know
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
what the area agency is going to provide
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
when the child receives when the child
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
ages out of special ed so we are left in
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
the dark what transition services do we
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
provide will the child be in an adult
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
group home in manchester so we teach the
 
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
child how to navigate public
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
transportation there or will the child
 
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
be in a a a foster home in berlin where
 
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
instead we need to be teaching the child
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
how to navigate what's in berlin
 
01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.150 align:start position:0%
how to navigate what's in berlin
and

01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
then because of the
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
because the area agencies have been
 
01:00:49.839 --> 01:00:51.349 align:start position:0%
because the area agencies have been
underfunded

01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
underfunded
 
01:00:51.359 --> 01:00:52.309 align:start position:0%
underfunded
um

01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
often what happens is when the child
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
ages out of special ed the area agency
 
01:00:58.079 --> 01:00:59.430 align:start position:0%
ages out of special ed the area agency
offers

01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
offers
 
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
very little
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
um and so the district has then wasted
 
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
all this money
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
preparing the child for life as an adult
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
um with through transition services
 
01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
and what we're preparing for is the
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
child to then fall off the cliff
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
when the area agency says we're not
 
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
going to provide services and it's not
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
because you've
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
you you were in special ed you've aged
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
out of special letters just because we
 
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
don't have enough money
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
what we have done is we used to have the
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
laconia state school
 
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
it was it served students of
 
01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:34.549 align:start position:0%
it was it served students of
served

01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
served
 
01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
adults with these disabilities of all
 
01:01:36.319 --> 01:01:38.069 align:start position:0%
adults with these disabilities of all
ages

01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
ages
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
it was a terrible place
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
we closed the laconia state school and
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
we enacted rsa 171a as a promise to
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
replace it with something better
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
and what we've done instead is
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
we fail to fully fund the better
 
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
and so we have a very
 
01:01:59.829 --> 01:01:59.839 align:start position:0%
very poor system where if you're
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
within the age range for special ed
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
school districts are your social safety
 
01:02:04.319 --> 01:02:05.190 align:start position:0%
school districts are your social safety
net

01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
net
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
um and if you're outside the age range
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
of special ed
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
you may get services under 171a you may
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
not and what you get under 171a if
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
you're getting any may be pretty um
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
maybe far less than what you deserve
 
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh i understand excuse me
 
01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
i understand where you're coming from
 
01:02:26.319 --> 01:02:27.270 align:start position:0%
i understand where you're coming from
okay

01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
but i cannot fix hhs
 
01:02:32.829 --> 01:02:32.839 align:start position:0%
okay i i cannot do
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
that that's what the health and human
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
services committee needs to do
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that
 
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
need to
 
01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
direct or whatever you want to say
 
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
health and human service
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
to take care of these
 
01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.549 align:start position:0%
to take care of these
people

01:02:48.549 --> 01:02:48.559 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
and i will i will say
 
01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.069 align:start position:0%
and i will i will say
that

01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
we have put a lot of money
 
01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.829 align:start position:0%
we have put a lot of money
into

01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:57.839 --> 01:02:58.710 align:start position:0%
 
these

01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.069 align:start position:0%
these
services

01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
in the last budget
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if it has improved or
 
01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
not improved
 
01:03:07.119 --> 01:03:08.150 align:start position:0%
not improved
but

01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
hhs tells us they have no one
 
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
what's it called the wait list
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether that's true or not
 
01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:19.910 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether that's true or not
but

01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
you know i'm just saying is i i cannot
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
solve the hhs problem
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
and that's why i think it's so important
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
that our
 
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
advocacy person
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
their office in
 
01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.270 align:start position:0%
their office in
hhs

01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
hhs
 
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
you know we we lost the
 
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
the lady that was doing it and doing a
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
really great job they've just appointed
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
somebody else that i've not met
 
01:03:46.559 --> 01:03:47.430 align:start position:0%
somebody else that i've not met
but

01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
i i just you know i can't solve that
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
problem i realize that okay but i i i
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
think we need to recognize that special
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
ed and 171a year like a water balloon if
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
you sign one side i i recognize that and
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
i am a big advocate for making sure
 
01:04:08.549 --> 01:04:08.559 align:start position:0%
that the um
 
01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
area agencies
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
don't let those folks drop off the table
 
01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:13.829 align:start position:0%
don't let those folks drop off the table
well

01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
my my modest suggestion is to just
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
include in the study commission uh uh
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
looking at we're eliminating the study
 
01:04:22.079 --> 01:04:23.270 align:start position:0%
looking at we're eliminating the study
committee

01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
okay okay all righty well yeah okay
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
representative heath
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair your testimony
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
really conflicts with the guidance that
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
we were given on friday from the ag's
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
office um
 
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
the other issue that i just want to
 
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
raise is um i was an educator for a long
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
long time special educator as well
 
01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
as well as being an administrator um
 
01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
for non-disabled students
 
01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
who might be turning 21 during their
 
01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
senior year of high school
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
at any point during that year
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
we would let them finish when they turn
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
if their birthday was in december and
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
they turned 21 i know of no student that
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
we would put out of high school
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
until they graduated
 
01:05:09.119 --> 01:05:10.069 align:start position:0%
until they graduated
so

01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
for me
 
01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
solves so many issues
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
i too have been appalled by
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
i found out only by accident from one of
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
my students who was disabled
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
and a student
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
she said to me mrs heath i will not be
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
here tomorrow because my birthday is
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
today and i can't come to school anymore
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
which i must have called everybody in
 
01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
the world to try and find out what i
 
01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
could do for her and my answer
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
was i couldn't do anything this young
 
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
lady was a foster child she lived in a
 
01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
group home she had to leave her group
 
01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:49.670 align:start position:0%
group home she had to leave her group
home

01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.270 align:start position:0%
home
and

01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
people told me that she should have got
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
into it um there should have been better
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
communication between the k-12 world and
 
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
the adult world but
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
this amendment for me
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
begins the process it brings
 
01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
more wholeness to the school district
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of the summer i ask the same
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
question what about summer programming
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
because that would be part of getting to
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
the cap so that would be included in the
 
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
funding um for this bill
 
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
i just seem like based on what the ag
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
said to us on friday that this seems
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
like the guidance that that we want to
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
incorporate within our legislation
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
for those students for students and
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a very very small
 
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
number of students
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
students that are placed at the
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
direction of the court
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
are different
 
01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
um so we've got a whole lot of stuff
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
going on here but i just feel like this
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
amendment gets us one step
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
along the path
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
to getting those kids to where they need
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
to be and hopefully during that period
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
of time from 21 to 22 there is
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
an impetus for the area agency
 
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
the parents the group home or whoever to
 
01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
work cooperatively so that in that
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
transition time the student does go
 
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
to something that is effective
 
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
and i mean i just am concerned that all
 
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
of a sudden after listening to the age
 
01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
on vig's office on friday now we're
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
hearing something completely different
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i
 
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
what i've been saying is it was in
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
letters that went to the house and
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
senate education committees it's not
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
something new
 
01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.549 align:start position:0%
something new
um

01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
the ag's office represents a state
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
agency which you know
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
they have a certain interest in
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
protecting the state budget
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps at the expense of local budgets
 
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
i agree with the wisdom
 
01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:53.990 align:start position:0%
i agree with the wisdom
of

01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
allowing a child to complete the school
 
01:07:56.319 --> 01:07:57.430 align:start position:0%
allowing a child to complete the school
year

01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.349 align:start position:0%
year
um

01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
and many school districts do allow it
 
01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:03.270 align:start position:0%
and many school districts do allow it
um

01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
senator conn's bill originally proposed
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
exactly that
 
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
but then the uh
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
senate amended his bill
 
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
um to
 
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh instead uh take eligibility not until
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
the end of the school year during which
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
you reach your 21st birthday but all the
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
way to your 22nd birthday
 
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
so there are several different problems
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
we're trying to solve whether you're
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
going to be allowed to finish the school
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
year where some districts allow some
 
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
districts don't
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
um whether you're going to take it to
 
01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
the 22nd birthday
 
01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:37.669 align:start position:0%
the 22nd birthday
um

01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:37.679 --> 01:08:38.470 align:start position:0%
um
whether

01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:39.430 align:start position:0%
whether
uh

01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
you are
 
01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
going to do it at the state's expense
 
01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:46.799 align:start position:0%
or at the school district's expense
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
and whether in making that choice you're
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
some people's interpretation
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
of what federal law demands
 
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
but also the very clear provision in our
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
uh represent lynn yes so i i guess i
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
have really two questions the first is
 
01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
if um
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
if i understand correctly and correct me
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
if you interpret it if we were to pass
 
01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:20.630 align:start position:0%
if you interpret it if we were to pass
this

01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
law or this bill
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment i'm sorry if we were to
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
pass this amendment
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
then school districts like for example
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
manchester as representative heath was
 
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
talking about that let a student who
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
turns 21 in december let's say finish
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
the school year under this a person who
 
01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
turns 22 in december would be able to
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
finish the school year or i mean a
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
school district presumably if they did
 
01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
it if they followed consistent practice
 
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
they'd say you can stay in school for
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
the rest of the year even after you're
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
22. is that would that follow they might
 
01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
well do that i'd be surprised if they do
 
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
that but they might well do it yes all
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
right and the second may i ask a
 
01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up second question i have is i
 
01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
understand your concern about the last
 
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.110 align:start position:0%
understand your concern about the last
sentence

01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh which begins on line 17 of the
 
01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment that it's sort of
 
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
wishy-washy in terms of what
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
it actually says
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
just uh when disability services needs
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
to be provided but i guess my concern
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
would be this
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
if this
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
language were
 
01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.070 align:start position:0%
language were
interpreted

01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
interpreted
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
to mean that disabilities that
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
developmental disability services
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
for which a student 21 years or of age
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
or older may qualify should be provided
 
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
and if dhhs is not
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
in other words if this was interpreted
 
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
to say between 21 and 22 you've got to
 
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
provide disability services and they're
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
not providing disability services for
 
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
students that are under 21 could that
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
create some equal protection problem
 
01:10:59.189 --> 01:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
that you can't you can't just do this
 
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
for only the people between 21 and 22.
 
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
well that's a good question i mean i've
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
i've looked at the equal protection
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
problem with these social benefit
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
programs including for
 
01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:10.950 align:start position:0%
programs including for
uh

01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh for education and um
 
01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
the rational basis test applies when
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
it's equal protection unless there's a
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
suspect or semi-suspect class
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
and um age is not a suspect or
 
01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
semi-suspect class it's why we have
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
social security but only if you reach a
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
certain age
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
and we have a variety of statutes that
 
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
are based on age and and they they
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
survived equal protection uh challenges
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
my my problem with this sentence and
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
mind you i've never seen this sentence
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
until just now uh and i'd love to have a
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
surprise none of us have it but if you
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
look at it on page 18 it's that that
 
01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
pregnant term may qualify um so if the
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
area if the area agency is now saying
 
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
dhhs is positioned now it's not in a
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
rule and and their position is on appeal
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
to the new hampshire supreme court
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
um but they um and as new hampshire
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
superior court has held their position
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
as wrong but they haven't changed it
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
their position dhhs's position is that
 
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
if you're in in special ed you don't
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
qualify under 171a period
 
01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
so if you use the term may qualify there
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
then i can easily see dhhs saying well
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
yeah only if you may qualify but you're
 
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
in special ed so you don't qualify and
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
of course you know i can argue that
 
01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:34.709 align:start position:0%
of course you know i can argue that
that's

01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
nonsensical but um it doesn't
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
with any level of assurance solve the
 
01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
problem of that that tragedy i i
 
01:12:46.239 --> 01:12:47.750 align:start position:0%
problem of that that tragedy i i
described

01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
described
 
01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:50.709 align:start position:0%
described
well

01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
the uh i you know
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
i believe you know you may qualify
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
all we're doing is upping the age
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
and it's not changing
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
the position of may qualify
 
01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:09.030 align:start position:0%
the position of may qualify
because

01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
you you qualify
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
for special ed
 
01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
when you first enter school
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
you know and some people
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
get out some people don't
 
01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.350 align:start position:0%
get out some people don't
and

01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
just because you happen to be
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
in special ed
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily mean that you
 
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
automatically qualify for
 
01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
hhs services
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
you have to reapply
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
what the area agency
 
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
and the services that the area agency
 
01:13:42.159 --> 01:13:43.350 align:start position:0%
and the services that the area agency
provides

01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
provides
 
01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
may in fact be totally different than
 
01:13:46.239 --> 01:13:48.149 align:start position:0%
may in fact be totally different than
what

01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
the school system was providing prior to
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
that so
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know how i don't know
 
01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know how we can change the word
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
may only because you may qualify or you
 
01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
may not
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
based on whatever the rules are in hhs
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
well i suppose a more direct approach
 
01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
offhand would be the uh to say that the
 
01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:14.470 align:start position:0%
offhand would be the uh to say that the
uh

01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
something like the mere fact
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
that a child is receiving special
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
education shall not disqualify the child
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair i still am
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
struggling where with the iep because
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
the iep is really the factor that drives
 
01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
all of this
 
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't it be contingent upon the
 
01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.350 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't it be contingent upon the
iep

01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
iep
 
01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.390 align:start position:0%
iep
um

01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
to really determine
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
that the ch
 
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
that identifies what should be happening
 
01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:57.750 align:start position:0%
that identifies what should be happening
so

01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
i i just am fearful of a shell
 
01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
exactly as chair umber is saying that it
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
would cause
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
i just don't underst i i
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying the mere fact that a
 
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
child qualifies for special ed shall not
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
disqualify the child
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
from whatever
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
the area agency would otherwise be
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
obligated to provide
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
and i actually
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative lynn
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
so i you know i th the language that you
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
propose i i agree that that would
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
that would sort of fix the problem but
 
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
my concern is that might really
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
fix too much in other words it might
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
it would i think would be interpreted to
 
01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:51.430 align:start position:0%
it would i think would be interpreted to
mean

01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
dhhs what you're doing now whether we go
 
01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
forget about the age limit of the age of
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
the child what you're doing now
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
is wrong you should be providing
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
disability services when they're needed
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
for a child whatever age that whether
 
01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
that's getting um uh
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
even if they are getting special
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
education services
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
and that might i'm not i don't know
 
01:16:15.669 --> 01:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
whether i would agree with that or not i
 
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
tend to think i probably would agree
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
with it but
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's way beyond i mean that as
 
01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
representative umbrella point out that's
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
a that's a
 
01:16:26.229 --> 01:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
battle for a different day at a in a
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
different committee i think understood
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's momentous
 
01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
if nothing else it just it underscores
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
um this is complex and the legislature
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
has never looked the legislature has
 
01:16:41.669 --> 01:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
looked at these two stature stories
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
schemes as freestanding each in their
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
own silo
 
01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:46.630 align:start position:0%
own silo
and

01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
just like the agencies need to talk to
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
each other the legislature's policy
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
committees need to talk to each other
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
to coordinate these two systems so
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
they're not at war with each other and
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
so the transition services the districts
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
are spending their money on and
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature's money on
 
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
are services that that prepare the child
 
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
for life as an adult when the child as
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
an adult will be under the umbrella of
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
the area agency
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to make it such a big picture
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
on a little it's quite all right we we
 
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
love to hear the other side
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative petry
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:25.030 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
uh

01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
on the 28a issue
 
01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:29.910 align:start position:0%
all right
65

01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
65
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
of people in state prison do not have a
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
high school education or equivalent
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
so it's a pay me now pay me later
 
01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:37.270 align:start position:0%
so it's a pay me now pay me later
so

01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
where do you stand i mean it's
 
01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to pay and if we
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
don't have educated people we're
 
01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to pay at some
 
01:17:44.239 --> 01:17:45.110 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to pay at some
point

01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
yeah the 28a issue is not whether you
 
01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
pay it's just who pays it's it's it's if
 
01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
if le
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
it's re it's been characterized by the
 
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire supreme court with like a
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
bean counting orientation that it makes
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
it difficult for school districts to
 
01:18:01.199 --> 01:18:02.149 align:start position:0%
it difficult for school districts to
budget

01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
i i think it's it's more profound it
 
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's saying um
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
to the legislature if you have a vision
 
01:18:11.669 --> 01:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
of social justice
 
01:18:11.679 --> 01:18:12.630 align:start position:0%
of social justice
then

01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:13.510 align:start position:0%
then
um

01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:14.310 align:start position:0%
um
you

01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
need to come up with the money out of
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
your own budgets
 
01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
to finance that vision
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh because then you take the credit but
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
you also take the blame
 
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:24.870 align:start position:0%
you also take the blame
and

01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
you know to take it
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
i i don't mean to be on a soap box here
 
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
but the foundations of democracy
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
a healthy democracy are transparency and
 
01:18:34.239 --> 01:18:35.830 align:start position:0%
a healthy democracy are transparency and
accountability

01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
representatives who are elected need to
 
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
be accountable
 
01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
um and to the voters and one way to be
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
accountable is you know the voters look
 
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
at the budgets they look at their taxes
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
and and when
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
the the heart of 28a
 
01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:51.990 align:start position:0%
the the heart of 28a
is

01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
that those who enact the laws should be
 
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
accountable for the financial
 
01:18:58.630 --> 01:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
consequences of those laws because
 
01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's a shell game where the
 
01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
legislature enacts the laws but avoids
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
the blame for any
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
poor decisions it's made regarding
 
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
whether the law was worth it
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
um because the legislature passes the
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
costs on
 
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
to the municipality
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
and the local
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
townspeople are confused they don't know
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
who to blame
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much i i appreciate
 
01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
it and um
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
i i appreciate your viewpoint
 
01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:36.550 align:start position:0%
i i appreciate your viewpoint
um

01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
and uh and i think it uh it helps us to
 
01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:42.149 align:start position:0%
and uh and i think it uh it helps us to
um

01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
understand and i totally agree with you
 
01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:45.910 align:start position:0%
understand and i totally agree with you
that

01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
the policy committees should talk to
 
01:19:49.270 --> 01:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
each other
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
i probably
 
01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
i probably talk more to
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
the policy committees
 
01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:58.790 align:start position:0%
the policy committees
than

01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
the policy committees talk to each other
 
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
but that's neither here nor there so
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um
 
01:20:08.709 --> 01:20:08.719 align:start position:0%
diana you wanna i thank you very much i
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
apologize for all the time i took
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate your listening to me that's
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
no problem
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is diana fenton i'm
 
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
an attorney with the department of
 
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
education in large part i'm here to
 
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
answer the committee's questions
 
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
and i cannot testify directly for
 
01:20:40.629 --> 01:20:40.639 align:start position:0%
attorney chris bond who is on vacation
 
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
right now but my understanding and i
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
don't work for the attorney general's
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
office and i want to be clear about that
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
01:20:48.550 --> 01:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
attorney bond's testimony has been
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
consistent throughout this legislative
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
session as it pertains to this bill
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
and the other the house bill that is the
 
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
there is a strong concern
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
that if this amendment is not passed if
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
the language is not changed that the
 
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
state will be subject to a lawsuit
 
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
and that has been consistent that
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
testimony has been consistent and it has
 
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
been clear
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
and again i'm not here to testify for
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office i don't
 
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
work for that agency
 
01:21:26.629 --> 01:21:26.639 align:start position:0%
but that has been their interpretation
 
01:21:26.639 --> 01:21:27.750 align:start position:0%
but that has been their interpretation
and

01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
that has been their testimony so i feel
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable referring this committee to
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
that prior testimony
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
i think that um certainly i have argued
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
before representative lin in his prior
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
capacity and in my prior capacity
 
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
and every case is
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
factually different
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
and we don't know how that case will
 
01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.070 align:start position:0%
and we don't know how that case will
arise

01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
arise
 
01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
but in looking at our law and looking at
 
01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
the rhode island case there are enough
 
01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
similarities to cause the state
 
01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:57.750 align:start position:0%
similarities to cause the state
pause

01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
pause
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
we feel that there will be a lawsuit and
 
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
it is troubling and we have an
 
01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
obligation to look out for the state
 
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
interest and our state funds and to
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
protect um against that so
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
again i'm um
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
playing the role of chris bond who is on
 
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
vacation today um and i'm happy to take
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
so i i i have no doubt
 
01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
that there would be a lawsuit but that
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that should be the end
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
of the matter i mean i mean i guess what
 
01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:34.070 align:start position:0%
of the matter i mean i mean i guess what
i'm

01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
what i'm wondering is and i as i say
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
this is brand new to me i haven't
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
researched this looked at this at all
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
but can you tell me do you know at all
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
for um from speaking with mr bond is
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
this first circuit case you know is this
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
just one case cases all over the country
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
all the other circuits are a substantial
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
number of them have all said no you have
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
to provide education services to age 22
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
or do we have one circuit court that you
 
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
know in a split decision
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
based on the specific
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
rationale of the rhode island law
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
said no you have to do this
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question this this is
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
very familiar to me uh representative
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
lynn we've done this before haven't we
 
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
in a different form
 
01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the crux of the
 
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
analysis is based on that rhode island
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
case that kl case and
 
01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
i understand it's one case it's a first
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
circuit case i am not aware of of other
 
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
cases that are kind of
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
following that domino effect um but in
 
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
my reading of the kl case and my
 
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
interpretation of it and speaking with
 
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
other attorneys it's very compelling
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
and the facts are very similar to the
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law we heard from
 
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
attorneys allen about the you know the
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
differences between the two but in
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
looking at it new hampshire's law
 
01:23:56.790 --> 01:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
aligns quite carefully with rhode
 
01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:57.750 align:start position:0%
aligns quite carefully with rhode
islands

01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
islands
 
01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:58.790 align:start position:0%
islands
so

01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know whether there will be a lawsuit
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
sure their lawsuits about all sorts of
 
01:24:02.719 --> 01:24:03.590 align:start position:0%
sure their lawsuits about all sorts of
things

01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
but the analysis from the attorney
 
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
general's office goes beyond whether or
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
not there will be a lawsuit
 
01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:10.149 align:start position:0%
not there will be a lawsuit
obviously

01:24:10.149 --> 01:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
and i think the testimony has been about
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
what the result of that lawsuit will be
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
and that's what is concerning and
 
01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:24.870 align:start position:0%
and that's what is concerning and
troubling

01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:33.189 --> 01:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
oh good we'll we'll see
 
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
so what about let's assume there's a
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
lawsuit and we lose uh or i mean there's
 
01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit and there's expenses involved
 
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
in the lawsuit if if we just do this
 
01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
as i unders what do you say about mr
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
zelen's concern about the long-term
 
01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:49.030 align:start position:0%
zelen's concern about the long-term
expenses

01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
of doing something that
 
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh of providing for uh for lack of a
 
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
better term another year
 
01:24:58.070 --> 01:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
of special education services that we
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question a very tough
 
01:25:10.239 --> 01:25:11.110 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question a very tough
question

01:25:11.110 --> 01:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:12.870 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure exactly how to answer
 
01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
that but i think based upon the concerns
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
that we've identified
 
01:25:22.149 --> 01:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
um of of a lawsuit and the costs that
 
01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
would come from that lawsuit and a lot
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
of people have spent an enormous amount
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
of time creating this amendment which
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
the belief is would
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
solve that issue
 
01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
i think the amendment before you solves
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
that problem to uh to the best of our
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
abilities and does so in a financially
 
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate way
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:52.629 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thanks for taking
 
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
the question of following up on
 
01:25:58.950 --> 01:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
representative lynn um although i think
 
01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh you believe that this would solve the
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
potential for a lawsuit similar to the
 
01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
rhode island case
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
um it was
 
01:26:10.149 --> 01:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
the testimony was given that
 
01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%
by not properly funding from the state
 
01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
level and the downshifting costs that we
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
would be subjected to
 
01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
potential or almost guaranteed
 
01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:20.390 align:start position:0%
potential or almost guaranteed
litigation

01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
on that end so my question would be is
 
01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
if we did nothing
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
just assuming i'm not saying we're doing
 
01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
it we did nothing right now and we had a
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
lawsuit similar to
 
01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
rhode island and we prevailed in that
 
01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:36.950 align:start position:0%
rhode island and we prevailed in that
case

01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
what would be the
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
long-term negative effects
 
01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:42.629 align:start position:0%
long-term negative effects
uh

01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
from not doing this
 
01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:46.629 align:start position:0%
from not doing this
this

01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:46.639 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
the bill or the amendment is it was that
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
clear on that uh yes i believe you were
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
very clear so
 
01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
you're changing the hypothetical uh just
 
01:26:57.510 --> 01:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
a bit to say we're talking hypothetical
 
01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
seriously that's right i'm used to it so
 
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
the hypothetical is there's
 
01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
no action is taken the lawsuit ensues
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
and the state
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
state wins um
 
01:27:12.629 --> 01:27:12.639 align:start position:0%
perhaps that limits the financial
 
01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
liability but there would still be that
 
01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.510 align:start position:0%
liability but there would still be that
lawsuit

01:27:15.510 --> 01:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
um and with that comes time and money
 
01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
and perhaps there will be lawsuits no
 
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
matter what that's what lawyers do
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
um but again i
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
i will direct this committee to the
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
consistent testimony that has been given
 
01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
functional equivalent in the house
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
and it's uh it's a rare time where you
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
get consensus by a lot of state
 
01:27:42.719 --> 01:27:44.550 align:start position:0%
get consensus by a lot of state
attorneys

01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
saying that there is a strong concern
 
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
and a strong likelihood is not that
 
01:27:50.470 --> 01:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
there will be a lawsuit there are
 
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
lawsuits all the time over everything
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
but that
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
the state will lose
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
and i would strongly encourage this
 
01:27:59.669 --> 01:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
committee to look at that testimony and
 
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
to really listen to those words
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
that chris bond has expressed on behalf
 
01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
of the attorney general's office
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
i would be remiss if that were to
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
go without emphasizing that concern that
 
01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
not only will the state be sued but that
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
there is a strong likelihood that the
 
01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
state would would not be successful in
 
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
such litigation but i say with the
 
01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
caveat that every case is different and
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
represent murray
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you again i apologize i wasn't
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
here this this past friday um and i'm
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
hearing so much around this legal talk
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
and so help me out because
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's when i'm looking at this build
 
01:28:46.629 --> 01:28:46.639 align:start position:0%
isn't it the right thing to do on the
 
01:28:49.110 --> 01:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
behalf of these children and isn't the
 
01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
concern how we benefit the children
 
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not we're
 
01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:54.639 align:start position:0%
all the legal stuff to me is somewhat
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
secondary to compared to
 
01:28:59.189 --> 01:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
the helping these kids who apparently
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
need this extra funding of this extra
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
year so i just i feel like i'm on a
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
different track from all the other
 
01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:21.910 --> 01:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
was that a sigh or was that that was a
 
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
sign i'm not sure that it's a question
 
01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
ever since i've been working on budgets
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
here several several of these budgets
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
i've heard these same arguments
 
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
and and it always came
 
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
it had to do with
 
01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:36.390 align:start position:0%
it had to do with
um

01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
funding the
 
01:29:41.110 --> 01:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
the wait list for this disability
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
and we we did get sued for not fully
 
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
funding that
 
01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
and i thought that after this past
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
budget cycle
 
01:29:51.189 --> 01:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
where we
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
did fund
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
all of the wait list that that had all
 
01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
been taken care of and and now i'm
 
01:29:58.629 --> 01:29:58.639 align:start position:0%
hearing the same arguments are coming
 
01:29:58.639 --> 01:29:59.430 align:start position:0%
hearing the same arguments are coming
back

01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
oh no representative bucco that's
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct
 
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
because that was
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
that was a problem
 
01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.430 align:start position:0%
that was a problem
and

01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:15.669 --> 01:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
what happens is that
 
01:30:17.679 --> 01:30:19.030 align:start position:0%
what happens is that
as

01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
the young adults
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
high schools
 
01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:30.629 align:start position:0%
high schools
to

01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:30.639 --> 01:30:32.830 align:start position:0%
 
dhhs

01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
services that
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
they may not
 
01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
be the same
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
and that's where
 
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
that's where
 
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
the problem is but that is
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
way outside
 
01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
of what we're looking at here we're just
 
01:30:50.229 --> 01:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure
 
01:30:50.239 --> 01:30:51.110 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure
that

01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:30:54.189 --> 01:30:54.199 align:start position:0%
the school system and
 
01:30:54.199 --> 01:30:56.070 align:start position:0%
the school system and
dhhs

01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
work together
 
01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:58.390 align:start position:0%
work together
to

01:30:58.390 --> 01:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
do something
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
after they age out of school
 
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you thank you
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair um i think ultimately
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
we want to afford the children with
 
01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:13.270 align:start position:0%
we want to afford the children with
disabilities

01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
the same courtesy that we would provide
 
01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
to their non-disabled peers
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
and if a child is 21 years old
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
and wanting to finish high school
 
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
we let them
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:28.709 align:start position:0%
for the most part
and

01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
for child with a severe disability
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
to be within our school system and to
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
have to suddenly disappear from the
 
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
ranks at the age 21
 
01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
it just it poses so many difficulties
 
01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
for the family for the school district
 
01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
for the child himself
 
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
and yes it needs to be a better
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
transition from the school district to
 
01:31:53.830 --> 01:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
the adult
 
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
um agency
 
01:31:59.189 --> 01:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
and the law says that i don't know what
 
01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
else we can do to make it more real
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
but i just feel like this amendment gets
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
us to where we need to be
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
based on the testimony that we heard
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
from the attorney from the attorney
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
general's office and from the department
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
who i heard and if i'm wrong please
 
01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
correct me that that there are people
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
lining up to protest
 
01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
um the fact that children need to leave
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
school at 21 in this particular
 
01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:30.550 align:start position:0%
school at 21 in this particular
circumstance

01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for miss
 
01:32:38.239 --> 01:32:41.590 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for miss
fenton

01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
did you have a question no
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
i want to move uh
 
01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
amendment 2022
 
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
no it's quite all right we
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
we just love all this stuff that
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
gets our juices rolling no you do
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
why we start every day
 
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
so thanks thanks very much madam chair
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
again dave luna
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh hopkins concord and serving on the
 
01:33:16.149 --> 01:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
house education committee um uh there's
 
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
been great testimony this morning i
 
01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
think it's been really helpful i i hate
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
to disagree
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
with my my um
 
01:33:27.669 --> 01:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
great friend from manchester and and
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
friend from newcastle but i'm concerned
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
that this amendment doesn't actually do
 
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
what what you'd like it to do which is
 
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
to protect
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
school districts who did not budget for
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
students going through age 22 during fy
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
23 because most these districts held
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
their meetings back in march and
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
approved those budgets and i think as
 
01:33:54.149 --> 01:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
all of us know
 
01:33:54.159 --> 01:33:55.030 align:start position:0%
all of us know
a

01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:33:57.110 --> 01:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
a school district budget is a bottom
 
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
line budget
 
01:33:58.400 --> 01:33:59.430 align:start position:0%
line budget
and

01:33:59.430 --> 01:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:01.030 align:start position:0%
and
and

01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
funds from things like capital reserve
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
funds like special education capital
 
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
reserve fund
 
01:34:09.669 --> 01:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
aren't there to exceed the budget they
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
can come in as funds to fund the budget
 
01:34:16.149 --> 01:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
you know in lieu of local
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
property taxes um but uh but they can't
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
well my my my belief is that they can't
 
01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:28.239 align:start position:0%
be used to exceed the budget what
 
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
what um
 
01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:30.550 align:start position:0%
what um
um

01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:32.870 align:start position:0%
um
what

01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
what most districts have been what some
 
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
districts let me say have been able to
 
01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:37.110 align:start position:0%
districts let me say have been able to
do

01:34:37.110 --> 01:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
is um is is
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
when uh when a district has a let's say
 
01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
two or three percent undesignated fund
 
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
balance is reappropriate from one line
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
to another line but we've seen a number
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
of districts tighten up on on budgets
 
01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
and the amount of undesignated fund
 
01:34:57.669 --> 01:34:57.679 align:start position:0%
balance that would be anticipated going
 
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
into the following year tends to be less
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
and less and less so it may not be
 
01:35:02.159 --> 01:35:03.590 align:start position:0%
and less and less so it may not be
sufficient

01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
to accommodate
 
01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
a you know a change in policy requiring
 
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
students to or allowing students to
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
to continue in school through
 
01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
through age 22. that's um
 
01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
that's my my uh my first concern um that
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
that the amendment doesn't doesn't
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
actually address it because it's very
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
clear from the amendment that that it
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
comes in to backfill in the following
 
01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
year so so
 
01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
but but talking about availability of
 
01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.950 align:start position:0%
but but talking about availability of
funds

01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
for school districts in fy 23 it doesn't
 
01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
provide for that and i don't believe
 
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
capital reserve funds
 
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
are going to be able to use that to over
 
01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
over extend to extend over their their
 
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
their budget
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
the um uh the second um point excuse me
 
01:35:55.109 --> 01:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
did you look at the latest uh fiscal
 
01:35:55.119 --> 01:35:56.709 align:start position:0%
did you look at the latest uh fiscal
note

01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:56.719 align:start position:0%
note
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen the all i have is the
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
amendment i haven't seen it oh okay
 
01:36:03.910 --> 01:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
because the latest fiscal note says
 
01:36:06.629 --> 01:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
six children with disabilities turning
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
21 during the current school year
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
right we had we had testimony to that
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's what
 
01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
that's the number of students that we're
 
01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:17.360 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:18.950 align:start position:0%
looking at
um

01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:20.229 --> 01:36:20.239 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
nine children with disabilities
 
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
during the next school year which is
 
01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:27.590 align:start position:0%
during the next school year which is
22-23

01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
22-23
 
01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:29.590 align:start position:0%
22-23
so

01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
yes right the school board has the right
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
to take the money out of
 
01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
a capital reserve account
 
01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:40.550 align:start position:0%
a capital reserve account
as

01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:36:43.189 --> 01:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
they have to vote on it obviously
 
01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh in order to
 
01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:46.950 align:start position:0%
uh in order to
fulfill

01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
fulfill
 
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
shortages in whatever
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
the capital reserve is yeah i i believe
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's only revenue shortages and not to
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
over not to extend beyond the budget but
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
i don't i'm that's you know
 
01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:01.030 align:start position:0%
i don't i'm that's you know
um

01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
12 years on a school board eight years
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
chair and um and and i i've i've never
 
01:37:10.629 --> 01:37:10.639 align:start position:0%
seen our ability to to go beyond what uh
 
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
what the what the voters uh approved as
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
a bottom line budget
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
at our at our march meetings um that
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
that said um i'm also concerned
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
about the um the number of of students
 
01:37:27.030 --> 01:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
that would be affected by by this policy
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
i believe it's probably more than than
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
four or six and we do have 186 students
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
that are currently
 
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
over 20 years old
 
01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
and have not received their um their
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
high school diploma so this likely over
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
time will apply to them as they as they
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
reach the age of of 22.
 
01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:48.639 align:start position:0%
and and i think a a question that we
 
01:37:51.590 --> 01:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
also had that was not satisfactorily
 
01:37:55.109 --> 01:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
answered in um in house education was
 
01:37:58.709 --> 01:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
what impact does this have on um on on
 
01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers who are also efa students
 
01:38:03.990 --> 01:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
in the state will they will they be
 
01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
eligible to to receive the their their
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
their state efa because that's all
 
01:38:10.159 --> 01:38:11.030 align:start position:0%
their state efa because that's all
state

01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
state money
 
01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:13.910 align:start position:0%
state money
um

01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh will they be able to receive that
 
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
those payments from the state through
 
01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
their through their 22nd uh birthday and
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
um and i think that's an open question
 
01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
the uh the answer we heard in in
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
committee was that nope efa students are
 
01:38:30.790 --> 01:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
done at age 18. but when taking a look
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
at the statute 194f it does not
 
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
terminate the the efa account for that
 
01:38:40.870 --> 01:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
student at age 18. so i believe they
 
01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
would continue to qualify
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
just as any student would for a um for a
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
right for public education according to
 
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
189 colon 1-a
 
01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:52.229 align:start position:0%
189 colon 1-a
which

01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
which currently is is through age 21 or
 
01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
until you receive your
 
01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
your high school diploma and um and i
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
think it's questionable as to what what
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
you know how how this would apply to um
 
01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
to home um uh schooling students so
 
01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
those are really the um i'm
 
01:39:11.590 --> 01:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
homeschooling students with a with an
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
efa so those are really my only two
 
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts it was clear in house education
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
that uh that that this bill i think
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
lacked a comprehensive um
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
financial review that that i think the
 
01:39:28.229 --> 01:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
legislature should be entitled to and um
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
and i think that was really the the the
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
concern that uh that we had and are
 
01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
hopeful that uh that the finance
 
01:39:37.109 --> 01:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
committee is going to uh is going to
 
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
look for that type of comprehensive
 
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
report i think that was part of the
 
01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
reason why
 
01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
why why we did put a study committee on
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
it but i certainly i certainly
 
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
understand removing the study committee
 
01:39:53.590 --> 01:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
as long as a comprehensive analysis of
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
how changing this policy would ripple
 
01:39:56.159 --> 01:39:57.270 align:start position:0%
how changing this policy would ripple
through

01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
um obligations for um uh for local
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
01:40:11.189 --> 01:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
if i didn't know better i would say that
 
01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
you're recommending itl
 
01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:15.669 align:start position:0%
you're recommending itl
um

01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:16.629 --> 01:40:16.639 align:start position:0%
i would
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
i would i would
 
01:40:20.070 --> 01:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
you know personally madam chair i would
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
proceed very cautiously um with this
 
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
and and um and you know i don't i
 
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
certainly cannot um uh speak for
 
01:40:31.270 --> 01:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
attorney bond
 
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
um um i i think um attorney fenton did
 
01:40:36.550 --> 01:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh did a did a good job
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
at um
 
01:40:41.109 --> 01:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh at summarizing his um
 
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
um his testimony that we heard in house
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
education it may be worth taking a look
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
at that that video and um uh in hearing
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
from that i have in my notes here next
 
01:40:55.109 --> 01:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
to attorney bond's testimony uh that new
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire may be different from rhode
 
01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:57.910 align:start position:0%
hampshire may be different from rhode
island

01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
island
 
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
and and i think he may have said that
 
01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
but i don't want to you know put words
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
into his mouth on um uh on that
 
01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:06.709 align:start position:0%
into his mouth on um uh on that
um

01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:06.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh and and i think there's certainly a
 
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
number of other areas that attorneys
 
01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
allen has um has brought up that that go
 
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
well beyond my um
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know competency in this in this area
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of a note of caution
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
and so so that's um
 
01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
that's all i'd really like to leave with
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
well maybe more of a comment i just
 
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
very quickly looked up online uh
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
the uh the the kl decision and i would
 
01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
just note because i think it at least is
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
somewhat important that the dissent in
 
01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
the case was written by
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
by judge lynch former chief judge of the
 
01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
first circuit a clinton appointee very
 
01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
very well respected so it seems to me
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
she may have been wrong i haven't
 
01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
studied it she may have been wrong but
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
this is not like you know this is this
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
is some you know insubstantial person
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
who wrote a crazy descent and uh and we
 
01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
have we don't have to worry about it
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
that's i'm very
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
confident that that's not the case so
 
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the you know she may be wrong the
 
01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
majority may be right we might lose if
 
01:42:17.830 --> 01:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
there was another lawsuit but
 
01:42:19.590 --> 01:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think that
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
um it can just be assumed that we you
 
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
know that that's that it that the
 
01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:28.550 align:start position:0%
 
all correct

01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
all correct
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
represent the heath
 
01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
madam cheer um could we hear from

side as well as legislators for folks
 
01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
who represented
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
okay absolutely thank you

great thank you very much okay thanks
steve

01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is karen
 
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
rosenberg i'm an attorney with the
 
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
disability rights center i'm also the
 
01:42:57.189 --> 01:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
policy director
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to
 
01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
answer some questions that have been
 
01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
raised here one from representative lin
 
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
about what other circuit courts have
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
weighed in on this decision and for your
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
information the second circuit court of
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
appeals and the ninth circuit court of
 
01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
appeals have also issued similar
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
decisions and cases challenging states
 
01:43:18.149 --> 01:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
failure to provide
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
a free appropriate public education to
 
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities until they
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
the day before they turned 22.
 
01:43:26.709 --> 01:43:26.719 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
this um the connecticut the decision
 
01:43:31.350 --> 01:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
from the second circuit arose out of
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
connecticut and it was decided last
 
01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:34.709 align:start position:0%
connecticut and it was decided last
summer

01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
summer
 
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
so it's a pretty it's a very recent
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
decision affirming this point and in
 
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
terms of the facts and new hampshire's
 
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
provision of adult education compared to
 
01:43:47.189 --> 01:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
rhode islands it's quite similar
 
01:43:47.199 --> 01:43:48.470 align:start position:0%
rhode islands it's quite similar
actually

01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:43:50.229 --> 01:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
what the first circuit held is that
 
01:43:52.390 --> 01:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
there are basically three criteria to
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
look at to determine whether states must
 
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
provide an appropriate education for
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities until they
 
01:44:02.229 --> 01:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
turn 22 those have to do with
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
a mandate that they do it we have such a
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
mandate and and in
 
01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:08.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law that adult education
 
01:44:11.669 --> 01:44:11.679 align:start position:0%
be provided that there be oversight from
 
01:44:14.229 --> 01:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
a state body which we have our state
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
department of education oversees the
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
provision of adult services and that the
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
services be subsidized with state and
 
01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
federal funds which also occurs in new
 
01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:24.790 align:start position:0%
federal funds which also occurs in new
hampshire

01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
we provide significant funding through
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
wioa the workforce
 
01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
initiative innovative opportunities act
 
01:44:33.669 --> 01:44:33.679 align:start position:0%
and also state funds to fund adult
 
01:44:36.390 --> 01:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
education in this state one distinction
 
01:44:40.390 --> 01:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
that i believe one of the senators
 
01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
attempted to draw had to do with whether
 
01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
students who are adults have to pay
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
anything out of pocket
 
01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.350 align:start position:0%
anything out of pocket
and

01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:49.109 --> 01:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
actually in rhode island students who
 
01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
are pursuing an adult diploma do pay out
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
of pocket a portion of the cost of
 
01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
securing an adult diploma so that's
 
01:44:58.870 --> 01:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
similar because in new hampshire some
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
students also would pay in new hampshire
 
01:45:03.590 --> 01:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
we do not charge students for
 
01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
preparation courses to secure the hiset
 
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
which is our high school equivalency
 
01:45:10.229 --> 01:45:10.239 align:start position:0%
exam i believe in rhode island they
 
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
actually do charge
 
01:45:13.830 --> 01:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
some programs do charge for students to
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
secure a high set so
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
there is a there are a lot of
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
similarities between how we operate our
 
01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
programs in new hampshire and how the
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
adult education programs operated in
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
rhode island and like i said other
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
circuits have come to this conclusion
 
01:45:30.629 --> 01:45:30.639 align:start position:0%
also it should be noted that the
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority of states do
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
provide special education services for
 
01:45:37.109 --> 01:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
students beyond their 21st
 
01:45:37.119 --> 01:45:39.030 align:start position:0%
students beyond their 21st
birthdays

01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
birthdays
 
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
so i hope that answers some questions i
 
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have
 
01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
other questions about the developmental
 
01:45:47.109 --> 01:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
services system or how um
 
01:45:49.590 --> 01:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
you know this interplays with that or
 
01:45:52.950 --> 01:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and please don't be shy if you
 
01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
want to speak you don't have to be asked
 
01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
you just you just have to
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know say i'd like to speak thanks

i'm still new at this position oh thank
 
01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
you for the invite yeah any any time
 
01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:08.870 align:start position:0%
you for the invite yeah any any time
we're

01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
especially on division two we're pretty
 
01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
we're pretty open
 
01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:13.669 align:start position:0%
we're pretty open
and

01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:16.629 --> 01:46:16.639 align:start position:0%
let folks talk if they need to thank you
 
01:46:16.639 --> 01:46:17.990 align:start position:0%
let folks talk if they need to thank you
okay

okay
 
01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
you may ask a question in the second and
 
01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
ninth circuit cases were they unanimous
 
01:46:23.830 --> 01:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
decisions or any dissent you know i
 
01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
do you did you have a question represent
 
01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
murray or is this just the heading no
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
i'm just thinking um but yeah if i may
 
01:46:40.229 --> 01:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind madam chair can you
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
again you know i wasn't here the other
 
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
one um just speak to
 
01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
the problem that this is attempting to
 
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
solve this gap between when you're 21
 
01:46:52.709 --> 01:46:52.719 align:start position:0%
and you have to leave school
 
01:46:52.719 --> 01:46:53.590 align:start position:0%
and you have to leave school
but

01:46:53.590 --> 01:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
other things haven't kicked in yet
 
01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
because you're not 22 can you just give
 
01:46:58.870 --> 01:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
a little scenario for what is the
 
01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
supposing what is this solving so
 
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
there's i think they're actually two
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
separate concerns here
 
01:47:07.030 --> 01:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
what this solves is bringing new
 
01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:08.709 align:start position:0%
what this solves is bringing new
hampshire's

01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire's
 
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
law in terms of eligibility for special
 
01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
education in line with federal law
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
so i think that's a separate concern
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
from what you're talking about where
 
01:47:20.709 --> 01:47:20.719 align:start position:0%
students especially students with
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities
 
01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:23.830 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities
are

01:47:23.830 --> 01:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:47:26.229 --> 01:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
experiencing difficulty in their
 
01:47:28.709 --> 01:47:28.719 align:start position:0%
transition to what we call adult
 
01:47:28.719 --> 01:47:29.990 align:start position:0%
transition to what we call adult
services

01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
and those are the services that are in
 
01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
place not for every student but for
 
01:47:35.669 --> 01:47:35.679 align:start position:0%
adult students who have certain
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities who require
 
01:47:40.470 --> 01:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
habilitation services services to help
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
them be successful
 
01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
in their homes and communities that
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily that are not
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
education services
 
01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:49.109 align:start position:0%
education services
and

01:47:49.109 --> 01:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:49.119 --> 01:47:50.070 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:51.109 align:start position:0%
um
as

01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
represent as um attorney zelen referred
 
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
to there's um currently a lawsuit that
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
my office brought to
 
01:48:01.189 --> 01:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
secure a decision
 
01:48:01.199 --> 01:48:02.229 align:start position:0%
secure a decision
that

01:48:02.229 --> 01:48:02.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
those services developmental services
 
01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:06.719 align:start position:0%
ought to be provided under our state law
 
01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
from the time when a student with a
 
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
developmental disability is eligible for
 
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
them regardless of whether they are in
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
school or out of school
 
01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:16.229 align:start position:0%
school or out of school
so

01:48:16.229 --> 01:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:16.239 --> 01:48:17.189 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:48:17.189 --> 01:48:17.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:19.590 --> 01:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's a gap that we're trying to
 
01:48:22.870 --> 01:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
address and there's actually a bill um
 
01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
that may come before you i think maybe
 
01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
not maybe it's division three sb430 that
 
01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
creates a pilot program to start
 
01:48:31.830 --> 01:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
providing some state funds for students
 
01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 18 and 21 who are
 
01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
still enrolled in school the position
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
that the department of health and human
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
services has taken is that when students
 
01:48:43.030 --> 01:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
are in school and over 18 that they are
 
01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
not entitled to developmental services
 
01:48:48.149 --> 01:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question
 
01:48:52.950 --> 01:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's helping me
 
01:48:54.709 --> 01:48:54.719 align:start position:0%
if you have more it's okay
 
01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
represent bucco
 
01:49:04.390 --> 01:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:05.270 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:07.990 --> 01:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
the this latest um
 
01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:12.719 align:start position:0%
amendment dated 422
 
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
and the only change that i see is it
 
01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
says that the students between the ages
 
01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
of 3 and 21 inclusive
 
01:49:21.589 --> 01:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
and that i think that
 
01:49:24.149 --> 01:49:24.159 align:start position:0%
covers what you just said what the
 
01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
that's that mirrors the language in the
 
01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:28.639 align:start position:0%
federal law idea the individuals with
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities education act
 
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
further comments caitlyn did you have
 
01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
your hand raised or no
 
01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:46.550 align:start position:0%
your hand raised or no
[Music]

01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:48.149 --> 01:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
01:49:48.159 --> 01:49:49.030 align:start position:0%
is there any
uh

01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
mr zelen
 
01:49:53.270 --> 01:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
just note that this little note
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
the latest one
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
is is limited to
 
01:50:04.149 --> 01:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:09.109 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
and in addition as i flip the page
 
01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
in addition to those in separate schools
 
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
um but still omits
 
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
those who are attending local public
 
01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:22.719 align:start position:0%
high schools
 
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
who can be very expensive when their
 
01:50:27.189 --> 01:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
transition services might be eleven
 
01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a month
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
but i guess that might account for
 
01:50:35.109 --> 01:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
representatives lunos figure of 186
 
01:50:36.870 --> 01:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
students who might be impacted by this
 
01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
bill versus the lower number of students
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
interested in physical knowledge i think
 
01:50:43.030 --> 01:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
rebecca ferdet may have secured some
 
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
updated numbers but also i think it's
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
really important to keep in mind that
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about an unfunded
 
01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
mandate here because this is a federal
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
mandate so it's not subject to our
 
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
constitutional prohibition against
 
01:50:59.189 --> 01:50:59.199 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates
 
01:50:59.199 --> 01:51:00.149 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates
and

01:51:00.149 --> 01:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
not not to mention we are funding it
 
01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:14.790 align:start position:0%
not not to mention we are funding it
right

01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much it was nice nice
 
01:51:21.189 --> 01:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
meeting you and uh hope that you'll have
 
01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
just just like we do every day
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative turcotte thank you
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair just a uh clarification
 
01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to talk about it
 
01:51:40.070 --> 01:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
but in a lot line 11 of the amendment
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
where it talks about uh towards the end
 
01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
over age 21 to age 22
 
01:51:47.990 --> 01:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
it was my understanding that the intent
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
of what we're trying to accomplish
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
is to
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
ensure an individual who starts
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
school at age 21 turns 22 during that
 
01:52:00.149 --> 01:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
school year
 
01:52:02.310 --> 01:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
is covered through the remainder of that
 
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
school year
 
01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
as i read this i could certainly
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
interpret the way it is written now i
 
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
think somebody may even mention this
 
01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:10.550 align:start position:0%
think somebody may even mention this
before

01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
that over age 21 to age 22
 
01:52:18.629 --> 01:52:18.639 align:start position:0%
are we now opening ourselves to
 
01:52:22.229 --> 01:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
somebody who starts school at age 22 and
 
01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
continuing on past that
 
01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
somebody just mentioned
 
01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
language which uses the term inclusive
 
01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:34.709 align:start position:0%
language which uses the term inclusive
um

01:52:34.709 --> 01:52:34.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
so as written i'm not so sure this is
 
01:52:40.229 --> 01:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
01:52:44.310 --> 01:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
no it would not require schools to keep
 
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
a student in school beyond their 22nd
 
01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
birthday and that's okay
 
01:52:55.990 --> 01:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
i mean i think some people think that
 
01:52:58.390 --> 01:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
that may not be okay for a student first
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
of all it does mirror the federal law
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
but also as a practical matter students
 
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
who are in school beyond their 21st
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
birthday or even beyond their 20th
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
birthday are really focusing on
 
01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
transition to adult services and a lot
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
of the time they don't have those same
 
01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
connections to the brick and mortar
 
01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:17.910 align:start position:0%
connections to the brick and mortar
building

01:53:17.910 --> 01:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
because they're getting their services
 
01:53:22.709 --> 01:53:22.719 align:start position:0%
in like job coaching and job training
 
01:53:26.229 --> 01:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
and internships and learning how to do
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
laundry and maintain an apartment and
 
01:53:30.070 --> 01:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
use public transportation and all those
 
01:53:31.350 --> 01:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
kinds of things
 
01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:32.709 align:start position:0%
kinds of things
so

01:53:32.709 --> 01:53:32.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's just something that you plan for so
 
01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
that student if the student really is
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
attached to the flow of the school then
 
01:53:42.709 --> 01:53:42.719 align:start position:0%
that student if it's right for them
 
01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
could choose to leave at the end of the
 
01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
prior school year
 
01:53:48.870 --> 01:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
or if they are really getting some
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
um very
 
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
beneficial community-based services then
 
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
they would continue those services
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
knowing that when they turn 22 they'll
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
be fully transitioning to second
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
secondary post-secondary services sorry
 
01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
i understand exactly
 
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
what you are interpreting the intent to
 
01:54:09.669 --> 01:54:09.679 align:start position:0%
be what i'm saying is as i read this i
 
01:54:11.350 --> 01:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
could certainly and i think other people
 
01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
could probably make an argument that
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
um this would now extend instead of as
 
01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
it's currently written
 
01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
written to age 21 and as representative
 
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
heath says they don't kick their people
 
01:54:24.149 --> 01:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
out and they go through the end of that
 
01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
school year
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
i believe an attorney could make an
 
01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
argument that well it says 22 now
 
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
so let's push that out an additional
 
01:54:35.669 --> 01:54:35.679 align:start position:0%
year well so you're you're referring to
 
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment or you were because the
 
01:54:39.270 --> 01:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
actual language talks about inclusive no
 
01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about the amendment so
 
01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:42.470 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about the amendment so
well

01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
i'm i don't share your concern but if
 
01:54:47.350 --> 01:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
you were really concerned about that you
 
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
could um
 
01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
just use like you could change the
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
language to something like um
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
through the age of 21 or until their
 
01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
22nd birthday or something if you're
 
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
really nervous about it but honestly i'm
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not nervous about it
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
but i'm not your lawyer
 
01:55:05.850 --> 01:55:05.860 align:start position:0%
by the way we don't have a lawyer
 
01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:07.430 align:start position:0%
by the way we don't have a lawyer
[Laughter]

01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
um we have mickey and he can't i
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying i i
 
01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
totally get it but um
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
i have been
 
01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
jotting down some more language because
 
01:55:19.589 --> 01:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
i do not think it is specific enough to
 
01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do but that's my my
 
01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:22.470 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do but that's my my
opinion

01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
well we we certainly
 
01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
um if that
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
seems to be a problem we could say
 
01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:29.870 align:start position:0%
seems to be a problem we could say
uh

01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:31.669 align:start position:0%
uh
[Music]

01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:55:31.679 --> 01:55:32.550 align:start position:0%
[Music]
over

01:55:32.550 --> 01:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:55:34.229 --> 01:55:34.239 align:start position:0%
age 21
 
01:55:36.790 --> 01:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
inclusive is that the term inclusive and
 
01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:55:39.589 --> 01:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
since the intent is to complete the
 
01:55:41.910 --> 01:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
school year almost which
 
01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think i'm sorry i'm interrupting
 
01:55:46.149 --> 01:55:46.159 align:start position:0%
you well that's that's what has been
 
01:55:48.550 --> 01:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
relayed here to me i'm new at this game
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
so i'm you know
 
01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
but that has been the
 
01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:53.830 align:start position:0%
but that has been the
uh

01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
since we're talking about education
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
and to me that has to deal with
 
01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
school years and
 
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative heath is very well versed
 
01:56:05.589 --> 01:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
in this and that's what i'm getting from
 
01:56:05.599 --> 01:56:07.109 align:start position:0%
in this and that's what i'm getting from
her

01:56:07.109 --> 01:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
her
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
i hear what you're saying but i don't
 
01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
think that's what the intent is because
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
if that was the intent
 
01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
to extend to mandate
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
schools to educate
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities beyond their
 
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
22nd birthday then i might actually
 
01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
agree with um attorneys ellen that there
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
would be an unfunded mandate no that's
 
01:56:27.589 --> 01:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
not that's not what i'm suggesting i'm
 
01:56:30.149 --> 01:56:30.159 align:start position:0%
just suggesting that the intent of the
 
01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
bill is a student who's 21
 
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
who turns 22 during the school year is
 
01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
indeed eligible to finish that school
 
01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
year that's the way
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
i this whole discussion has centered
 
01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
around not
 
01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
and what i'm saying is i believe this
 
01:56:47.350 --> 01:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
just opens it up so i would at some
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
point if we approve this i think it
 
01:56:51.669 --> 01:56:51.679 align:start position:0%
needs to be well clarified a little bit
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
we'll fix it but
 
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
if you're not and
 
01:56:57.669 --> 01:56:57.679 align:start position:0%
i i don't know what the right words are
 
01:56:59.669 --> 01:56:59.679 align:start position:0%
but we may you know
 
01:56:59.679 --> 01:57:01.270 align:start position:0%
but we may you know
that

01:57:01.270 --> 01:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
district cost providing service special
 
01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:05.270 align:start position:0%
district cost providing service special
education

01:57:05.270 --> 01:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:08.470 align:start position:0%
education
students

01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
and says over age 21 until the their
 
01:57:14.070 --> 01:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
22nd birthday or until the end of the
 
01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:16.239 align:start position:0%
school year if that was a good point no
 
01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
we it wasn't until the school year no
 
01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's the 22nd birthday
 
01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:22.790 align:start position:0%
it's the 22nd birthday
until

01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
until
 
01:57:28.070 --> 01:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
i think that would match what the
 
01:57:32.550 --> 01:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
federal law provides because it
 
01:57:34.629 --> 01:57:34.639 align:start position:0%
if school districts want to be you know
 
01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
extra generous that's on them really um
 
01:57:39.270 --> 01:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
it's nice but it may not be it's not
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
necessary in terms of compliance with
 
01:57:42.550 --> 01:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
the federal law
 
01:57:47.890 --> 01:57:47.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:47.900 --> 01:57:52.149 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:57:52.149 --> 01:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
do we do we want to say until their 22nd
 
01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:57.030 align:start position:0%
do we do we want to say until their 22nd
birthday

01:57:57.030 --> 01:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
birthday
 
01:57:57.040 --> 01:57:58.790 align:start position:0%
birthday
okay

01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
i i mean i hate to be in the position to
 
01:58:01.510 --> 01:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
advocate for less for people with
 
01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities it really it does seem
 
01:58:05.910 --> 01:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
awful but i but i really need to you
 
01:58:08.229 --> 01:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
know be real with you so the federal law
 
01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't require it we always want people
 
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
to be real
 
01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:12.950 align:start position:0%
to be real
okay

01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:58:15.189 --> 01:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
thank you anything else
 
01:58:15.199 --> 01:58:15.990 align:start position:0%
thank you anything else
so

01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:18.790 --> 01:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
mickey will do his magic
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
are we all set with the um the section
 
01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:25.589 align:start position:0%
are we all set with the um the section
about

01:58:25.589 --> 01:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:58:26.790 --> 01:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
i think so
 
01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
i don't believe sorry rebecca fernett i
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
don't believe that adult services
 
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
specifies an age of 21 i believe it says
 
01:58:47.589 --> 01:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
until they graduate or exit school what
 
01:58:49.990 --> 01:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
it says here a provision of such
 
01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:51.510 align:start position:0%
it says here a provision of such
services

01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:58:54.629 --> 01:58:54.639 align:start position:0%
does not preclude adult development
 
01:58:57.109 --> 01:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
disability services for which a student
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
over 20 years of age may qualify
 
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's i want to make
 
01:59:03.750 --> 01:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
that's the language that we need to
 
01:59:07.109 --> 01:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
address that if in fact that the child
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
is 21 finishing the school year whatever
 
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
service is finishing um that they are
 
01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:14.629 align:start position:0%
service is finishing um that they are
entitled

01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
entitled
 
01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
for that transition into the adult
 
01:59:25.189 --> 01:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:25.199 --> 01:59:26.229 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:59:26.229 --> 01:59:26.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:28.950 --> 01:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
um here's here's where we get to that
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that drc has that's on appeal to
 
01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire supreme court
 
01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
so in
 
01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
the case that where we prevailed in
 
01:59:40.550 --> 01:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
superior court the court held that
 
01:59:43.510 --> 01:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
students who are over 18 years of age
 
01:59:45.910 --> 01:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
who also are eligible for developmental
 
01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:47.270 align:start position:0%
who also are eligible for developmental
services

01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:59:50.070 --> 01:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
are eligible to receive those services
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
when they're in school if they're not
 
01:59:54.070 --> 01:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
services that are the responsibility of
 
01:59:55.669 --> 01:59:55.679 align:start position:0%
the school district
 
01:59:55.679 --> 01:59:56.790 align:start position:0%
the school district
and

01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know in transparency this is this is
 
02:00:00.629 --> 02:00:00.639 align:start position:0%
now the the state department of health
 
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
and human services is appealing that
 
02:00:02.159 --> 02:00:03.189 align:start position:0%
and human services is appealing that
decision

02:00:03.189 --> 02:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:00:05.589 --> 02:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
but that is our view that there are
 
02:00:07.669 --> 02:00:07.679 align:start position:0%
students who should not be forced out of
 
02:00:07.679 --> 02:00:08.629 align:start position:0%
students who should not be forced out of
school

02:00:08.629 --> 02:00:08.639 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:00:10.950 --> 02:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
in order to secure services from the
 
02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
developmental services system and that
 
02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
they need perhaps like residential
 
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
supports that they may not require to
 
02:00:20.070 --> 02:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
get an appropriate education
 
02:00:22.070 --> 02:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
well voc rehab is another service that
 
02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
students could receive i
 
02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
i did sort of wordsmith a little
 
02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
something with um attorney zelen that he
 
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
might feel better about in terms of
 
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
addressing this issue which we could
 
02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:35.750 align:start position:0%
addressing this issue which we could
share

02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
share
 
02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:37.109 align:start position:0%
share
if

02:00:37.109 --> 02:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
you wanna
 
02:00:43.589 --> 02:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:49.270 --> 02:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:50.229 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:00:50.229 --> 02:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:52.149 --> 02:00:52.159 align:start position:0%
that that i did
 
02:00:54.629 --> 02:00:54.639 align:start position:0%
a little wordsmithing and ran it by um
 
02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
attorneys allen to
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
sort of restructure this in a way that
 
02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:00.390 align:start position:0%
sort of restructure this in a way that
would

02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
make it clear that students who qualify
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
for developmental disability services
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
could secure those services if they're
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
not required for the student to receive
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
a free appropriate public education
 
02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:13.109 align:start position:0%
a free appropriate public education
and

02:01:13.109 --> 02:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:19.589 --> 02:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
basically capture all adult students
 
02:01:21.510 --> 02:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
like i said this is something that is
 
02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
currently being appealed about whether
 
02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
this applies to all adult students
 
02:01:29.830 --> 02:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
whether you know we think it should or
 
02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
whether you want to take a narrower
 
02:01:34.229 --> 02:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
approach and only have it
 
02:01:35.910 --> 02:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
something like this apply to students
 
02:01:38.229 --> 02:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
who are over 21 of course we want it
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
we agree that it would be better to um
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
just have this provision kind of cleared
 
02:01:45.910 --> 02:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
up in terms of adult students securing
 
02:01:48.790 --> 02:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
the services they're entitled to so
 
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
my beautiful handwriting yes i i
 
02:01:53.109 --> 02:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
understand that but
 
02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is dealing with the 21
 
02:01:56.880 --> 02:01:58.229 align:start position:0%
this bill is dealing with the 21
age

02:01:58.229 --> 02:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
age
 
02:01:59.750 --> 02:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:02:03.750 --> 02:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
that other issue is an hhs h.a what we
 
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
could do is issue
 
02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:06.870 align:start position:0%
could do is issue
yes

02:02:06.870 --> 02:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:02:09.189 --> 02:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
20 make it 21 and
 
02:02:10.470 --> 02:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
we'll try to
 
02:02:11.669 --> 02:02:11.679 align:start position:0%
try to propose something like that i'm
 
02:02:13.750 --> 02:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
just looking at this for the first time
 
02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:15.350 align:start position:0%
just looking at this for the first time
um

02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:17.189 --> 02:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
just two minutes ago i just wrote it
 
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
three minutes ago
 
02:02:20.470 --> 02:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
yeah and and maybe that
 
02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
some like if you were interested in it
 
02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:24.070 align:start position:0%
some like if you were interested in it
um

02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:27.510 --> 02:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
it's not perfect i think it's um
 
02:02:29.669 --> 02:02:29.679 align:start position:0%
the closest we could come up
 
02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
the best we could do now under these
 
02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:32.870 align:start position:0%
the best we could do now under these
circumstances

02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
how about if i give you an hour
 
02:02:36.149 --> 02:02:36.159 align:start position:0%
but my
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
okay all right i'll be quiet let's work
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
on okay
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:02:49.669 --> 02:02:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:53.109 --> 02:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:55.270 --> 02:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
go off to lunch and
 
02:02:57.750 --> 02:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
we'll be back at one o'clock
 
02:03:01.109 --> 02:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
and yes i thought this was very simple
 
02:03:04.470 --> 02:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
but obviously even the easiest things
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
are difficult
 
02:03:09.270 --> 02:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
so okay mickey you do not have to run
 
02:03:11.510 --> 02:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
and do an amendment
 
02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:12.870 align:start position:0%
and do an amendment
okay

02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:35.760 --> 03:05:56.630 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:05:56.630 --> 03:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:58.830 --> 03:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
okay i'll call us back
 
03:06:01.830 --> 03:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
to whatever order
 
03:06:05.510 --> 03:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
and we'll continue work on
 
03:06:08.950 --> 03:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:12.150 --> 03:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
when we left a couple of our friends
 
03:06:14.870 --> 03:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
were going to work on some language
 
03:06:19.429 --> 03:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
to replace uh the last sentence
 
03:06:19.439 --> 03:06:20.309 align:start position:0%
to replace uh the last sentence
in

03:06:20.309 --> 03:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:06:23.349 --> 03:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
the amen not the last sentence but uh
 
03:06:28.950 --> 03:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
lines 17 and 18 and then 19.
 
03:06:28.960 --> 03:06:29.830 align:start position:0%
lines 17 and 18 and then 19.
and

03:06:29.830 --> 03:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:06:29.840 --> 03:06:31.590 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:06:31.590 --> 03:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:35.269 --> 03:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:37.990 --> 03:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:06:40.230 --> 03:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
i just like to read
 
03:06:43.190 --> 03:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
what they said
 
03:06:44.950 --> 03:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
i guess they want this as a new
 
03:06:44.960 --> 03:06:46.150 align:start position:0%
i guess they want this as a new
paragraph

03:06:46.150 --> 03:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
03:06:48.230 --> 03:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
03:06:48.240 --> 03:06:49.670 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
um

03:06:49.670 --> 03:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:51.910 --> 03:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
a student's receipt
 
03:06:54.870 --> 03:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
of special education services
 
03:06:56.630 --> 03:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
under rsa
 
03:06:56.640 --> 03:07:00.070 align:start position:0%
under rsa
186-c

03:07:00.070 --> 03:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:03.590 --> 03:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
shall not affect whether such student
 
03:07:05.750 --> 03:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
may simultaneously
 
03:07:08.150 --> 03:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
receive developmental
 
03:07:11.110 --> 03:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
disability services which they may be
 
03:07:13.030 --> 03:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive
 
03:07:16.309 --> 03:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
under rsa 171
 
03:07:22.950 --> 03:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:26.469 --> 03:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:33.910 --> 03:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:35.750 --> 03:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
well we all want what's best for kids
 
03:07:35.760 --> 03:07:36.550 align:start position:0%
well we all want what's best for kids
yeah

03:07:36.550 --> 03:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:07:36.560 --> 03:07:37.590 align:start position:0%
yeah
so

03:07:37.590 --> 03:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:07:39.590 --> 03:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
sure just just one question where does
 
03:07:39.600 --> 03:07:40.309 align:start position:0%
sure just just one question where does
this

03:07:40.309 --> 03:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:07:42.950 --> 03:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
language be start on the in the bill
 
03:07:45.670 --> 03:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
okay what they're doing is
 
03:07:47.590 --> 03:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
they're they're making that last
 
03:07:49.429 --> 03:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
sentence right
 
03:07:51.670 --> 03:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
number two
 
03:07:54.630 --> 03:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
oh okay okay okay and then
 
03:07:55.910 --> 03:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
and then that
 
03:07:57.510 --> 03:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
not number
 
03:07:59.910 --> 03:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
not exactly what we decided was that it
 
03:08:01.670 --> 03:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
might be it would make more sense to
 
03:08:04.469 --> 03:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
move it up into the body of the bill so
 
03:08:08.230 --> 03:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's so so so if you look at the
 
03:08:09.750 --> 03:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
the bill as
 
03:08:11.830 --> 03:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
amended by the house
 
03:08:13.750 --> 03:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
what this would do is it does two things
 
03:08:16.150 --> 03:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
it would okay the only thing that we're
 
03:08:18.550 --> 03:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
discussing is the amendment right
 
03:08:20.790 --> 03:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
it is the amendment okay okay so but
 
03:08:22.790 --> 03:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
instead of having it
 
03:08:23.830 --> 03:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
so what
 
03:08:25.750 --> 03:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
so the the issue had to do with that
 
03:08:27.990 --> 03:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
last sentence in the proposed amendment
 
03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:28.870 align:start position:0%
last sentence in the proposed amendment
right

03:08:28.870 --> 03:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:08:28.880 --> 03:08:30.070 align:start position:0%
right
so

03:08:30.070 --> 03:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:08:33.269 --> 03:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
what we thought made more sense was to
 
03:08:33.279 --> 03:08:34.550 align:start position:0%
what we thought made more sense was to
um

03:08:34.550 --> 03:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:36.950 --> 03:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
take out that last line from the
 
03:08:38.950 --> 03:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment
 
03:08:41.590 --> 03:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
but move the concept
 
03:08:43.830 --> 03:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
that that that that line was attempting
 
03:08:45.349 --> 03:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
to achieve
 
03:08:45.359 --> 03:08:47.429 align:start position:0%
to achieve
to

03:08:47.429 --> 03:08:47.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:08:50.309 --> 03:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
further up in the body of the bill so if
 
03:08:52.150 --> 03:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
you have the bill in the bill in front
 
03:08:54.710 --> 03:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:57.990 --> 03:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
as passed by the house
 
03:08:59.670 --> 03:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
it would create a new it would be
 
03:09:02.070 --> 03:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
incentive where do you want it so in in
 
03:09:04.230 --> 03:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
the original in the bill that was passed
 
03:09:06.469 --> 03:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
section one okay forget the bill that
 
03:09:06.479 --> 03:09:08.309 align:start position:0%
section one okay forget the bill that
passed

03:09:08.309 --> 03:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
passed
 
03:09:09.910 --> 03:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
well that
 
03:09:12.550 --> 03:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
we're only talking about the amendment
 
03:09:15.269 --> 03:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
right so this amendment would just it's
 
03:09:16.710 --> 03:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
this is what the language would be we
 
03:09:19.030 --> 03:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
just felt that a more appropriate place
 
03:09:21.429 --> 03:09:21.439 align:start position:0%
to put the amendment would be
 
03:09:22.630 --> 03:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:09:24.630 --> 03:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
in under you know when you're talking
 
03:09:26.229 --> 03:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
about eligibility and the bill would
 
03:09:28.309 --> 03:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
just it would just amend the bill and
 
03:09:30.950 --> 03:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
then you keep your amendment
 
03:09:32.389 --> 03:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
but just strike the last sentence and
 
03:09:38.790 --> 03:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:42.790 --> 03:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment replaces the entire bill
 
03:09:47.190 --> 03:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
i think that section two
 
03:09:51.349 --> 03:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
by replacing all after section one right
 
03:09:54.950 --> 03:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
so so the amendment is just section two
 
03:09:57.030 --> 03:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
right and then the bill what we propose
 
03:09:59.110 --> 03:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
to do is put this concept in section one
 
03:10:00.389 --> 03:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
because it kind of keeps all the
 
03:10:02.870 --> 03:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
eligibility stuff together okay so
 
03:10:03.990 --> 03:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
you're seeing
 
03:10:06.229 --> 03:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
at the end of
 
03:10:08.389 --> 03:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
section one
 
03:10:11.269 --> 03:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
which we didn't eliminate
 
03:10:12.950 --> 03:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
right you would you would add this
 
03:10:12.960 --> 03:10:15.349 align:start position:0%
right you would you would add this
concept

03:10:15.349 --> 03:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
concept
 
03:10:15.359 --> 03:10:16.630 align:start position:0%
concept
right

03:10:16.630 --> 03:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:10:19.030 --> 03:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
and then if you did that
 
03:10:21.750 --> 03:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
then you still keep the amendment that
 
03:10:24.229 --> 03:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
you are proposing with the one exception
 
03:10:25.750 --> 03:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
that you would just
 
03:10:27.990 --> 03:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
note you would no longer need the last
 
03:10:30.790 --> 03:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
line of what is in the
 
03:10:33.830 --> 03:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment roman numeral one
 
03:10:37.349 --> 03:10:37.359 align:start position:0%
so you could just strike that last line
 
03:10:39.510 --> 03:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay okay right because we've taken care
 
03:10:41.750 --> 03:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
of that concept by moving it up to under
 
03:10:41.760 --> 03:10:43.190 align:start position:0%
of that concept by moving it up to under
eligibility

03:10:43.190 --> 03:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
03:10:46.309 --> 03:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
and does that make sense now it does
 
03:10:49.030 --> 03:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
and our rationale was
 
03:10:50.469 --> 03:10:50.479 align:start position:0%
that we
 
03:10:53.429 --> 03:10:53.439 align:start position:0%
that that sentence that um
 
03:10:55.190 --> 03:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
we're removing if we left it where it
 
03:10:57.830 --> 03:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
was it would be linked to just one
 
03:10:59.269 --> 03:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
school year
 
03:11:01.349 --> 03:11:01.359 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to have
 
03:11:03.750 --> 03:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
that that sentence
 
03:11:06.070 --> 03:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
relating to the children
 
03:11:08.469 --> 03:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
with developmental disabilities
 
03:11:10.550 --> 03:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
modify the whole scheme
 
03:11:13.269 --> 03:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
not just the uh the whole harmless
 
03:11:14.950 --> 03:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
clause pertaining to that one school
 
03:11:17.670 --> 03:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
year and then and we tried the language
 
03:11:19.429 --> 03:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
that we're proposing
 
03:11:21.269 --> 03:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
uh we tried to make as neutral as
 
03:11:25.110 --> 03:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
possible so we didn't tilt the tables
 
03:11:28.070 --> 03:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
one way or another in terms of whether
 
03:11:28.080 --> 03:11:28.790 align:start position:0%
one way or another in terms of whether
the

03:11:28.790 --> 03:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:11:31.670 --> 03:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
area agency would have a duty to
 
03:11:33.830 --> 03:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
children who are still receiving special
 
03:11:36.389 --> 03:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
ed we thought we just let the supreme
 
03:11:38.150 --> 03:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
court decide that
 
03:11:39.590 --> 03:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
and we
 
03:11:42.070 --> 03:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
didn't want to create any legislative
 
03:11:42.080 --> 03:11:43.269 align:start position:0%
didn't want to create any legislative
history

03:11:43.269 --> 03:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
history
 
03:11:47.349 --> 03:11:47.359 align:start position:0%
that would have any impact on that case
 
03:11:49.910 --> 03:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay does everybody get that other than
 
03:11:52.229 --> 03:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
me who was uh like
 
03:11:53.750 --> 03:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
totally something else
 
03:11:56.309 --> 03:11:56.319 align:start position:0%
tom oops sorry represent buca thank you
 
03:11:57.670 --> 03:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
03:12:00.229 --> 03:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
if we're leaving section one
 
03:12:02.229 --> 03:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
it it already contains language that
 
03:12:04.389 --> 03:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
says between the ages of 3 and 21
 
03:12:06.469 --> 03:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
inclusive i thought that was the
 
03:12:08.870 --> 03:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
intent of trying to change the language
 
03:12:10.870 --> 03:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
that language is already there
 
03:12:13.830 --> 03:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
right no the the language that we're
 
03:12:17.190 --> 03:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
replacing is in the amendment
 
03:12:17.200 --> 03:12:18.469 align:start position:0%
replacing is in the amendment
online

03:12:18.469 --> 03:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
online
 
03:12:21.750 --> 03:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
17 18 and 19.
 
03:12:23.830 --> 03:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
provision of such services does not
 
03:12:26.229 --> 03:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
preclude adult development
 
03:12:28.550 --> 03:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
disability services
 
03:12:30.870 --> 03:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's going away
 
03:12:33.510 --> 03:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
03:12:35.110 --> 03:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
but this
 
03:12:37.190 --> 03:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
will go up here
 
03:12:39.670 --> 03:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
under paragraph one
 
03:12:40.790 --> 03:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
i got it
 
03:12:42.710 --> 03:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
under paragraph one yeah so it would be
 
03:12:45.429 --> 03:12:45.439 align:start position:0%
a new it would be a paragraph roman two
 
03:12:47.030 --> 03:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh oh okay
 
03:12:49.030 --> 03:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
yeah right okay i thought it was i
 
03:12:50.630 --> 03:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
thought you were leaving one and putting
 
03:12:50.640 --> 03:12:51.349 align:start position:0%
thought you were leaving one and putting
in

03:12:51.349 --> 03:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:12:52.710 --> 03:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:12:54.630 --> 03:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
i mean i i think i could sum up the
 
03:12:56.389 --> 03:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
effects of what we're doing yeah it's
 
03:12:58.630 --> 03:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
okay i think we understand the effect
 
03:12:58.640 --> 03:13:00.229 align:start position:0%
okay i think we understand the effect
and

03:13:00.229 --> 03:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:13:03.510 --> 03:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
can i answer your question about that
 
03:13:06.309 --> 03:13:06.319 align:start position:0%
certainly i understand what you
 
03:13:08.070 --> 03:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
want to do
 
03:13:10.710 --> 03:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
but i guess as i read this a student's
 
03:13:13.269 --> 03:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
receipt of special education services
 
03:13:15.910 --> 03:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
under 1 186 c
 
03:13:17.830 --> 03:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
shall not affect whether such student
 
03:13:20.229 --> 03:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
may may simultaneously receive some
 
03:13:22.630 --> 03:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
developmental service but
 
03:13:25.830 --> 03:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
by saying that isn't the isn't
 
03:13:29.750 --> 03:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
the way dhhs is now
 
03:13:29.760 --> 03:13:31.190 align:start position:0%
the way dhhs is now
operating

03:13:31.190 --> 03:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
operating
 
03:13:33.110 --> 03:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
it does affect it the fact that the
 
03:13:35.110 --> 03:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
student is receiving
 
03:13:37.510 --> 03:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
is receiving special education services
 
03:13:39.910 --> 03:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
means they can't get these services so
 
03:13:42.790 --> 03:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
if we say this haven't we ascend i mean
 
03:13:44.070 --> 03:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
you may not have intended this but
 
03:13:46.150 --> 03:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
haven't we said in effect you're like
 
03:13:48.710 --> 03:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
you don't need a lawsuit you won well
 
03:13:50.309 --> 03:13:50.319 align:start position:0%
we really you know that would have been
 
03:13:51.510 --> 03:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
just like awesome if we could have done
 
03:13:53.510 --> 03:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
that but we knew that was not that we're
 
03:13:55.349 --> 03:13:55.359 align:start position:0%
really fair to do that so what we think
 
03:13:58.229 --> 03:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
that this does though is it says that
 
03:13:59.670 --> 03:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
it acknowledges that they have to be
 
03:14:01.990 --> 03:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive those services so
 
03:14:04.309 --> 03:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
there are actually some services that
 
03:14:06.550 --> 03:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
students even like under 18 years old
 
03:14:07.830 --> 03:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
that are developmental services that
 
03:14:10.150 --> 03:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
they are entitled to receive even though
 
03:14:12.469 --> 03:14:12.479 align:start position:0%
they're receiving special ed services so
 
03:14:14.150 --> 03:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
there are some that there's not even a
 
03:14:16.469 --> 03:14:16.479 align:start position:0%
debate about so for example we have an
 
03:14:19.670 --> 03:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
in-home supports waiver for kids who are
 
03:14:22.710 --> 03:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
i believe it's up to 21 right now
 
03:14:25.110 --> 03:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
for that's more limited than what our
 
03:14:26.790 --> 03:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities waiver
 
03:14:26.800 --> 03:14:28.229 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities waiver
provides

03:14:28.229 --> 03:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
provides
 
03:14:30.389 --> 03:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
so student and those students receive
 
03:14:32.229 --> 03:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
those in-home supports and they go to
 
03:14:34.309 --> 03:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
school and they and there's no debate
 
03:14:36.309 --> 03:14:36.319 align:start position:0%
even about that that really what that
 
03:14:39.429 --> 03:14:39.439 align:start position:0%
means where the debate is is
 
03:14:41.190 --> 03:14:41.200 align:start position:0%
what at what age
 
03:14:43.269 --> 03:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
is a student eligible to receive
 
03:14:45.190 --> 03:14:45.200 align:start position:0%
developmental services under our
 
03:14:47.510 --> 03:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
developmental disability waiver program
 
03:14:49.830 --> 03:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's a medicaid it's a medicaid waiver
 
03:14:53.110 --> 03:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
program and so by using the word um
 
03:14:55.429 --> 03:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
developmental services which they may be
 
03:14:57.190 --> 03:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive
 
03:14:59.510 --> 03:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
really kind of leaves it up to
 
03:15:01.590 --> 03:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
the decision makers at this point it's
 
03:15:02.950 --> 03:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
going to be the new hampshire supreme
 
03:15:05.510 --> 03:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
court about when a student who is
 
03:15:07.830 --> 03:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
enrolled in school is eligible no it's
 
03:15:10.550 --> 03:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
not up to the supreme court it's up to
 
03:15:10.560 --> 03:15:12.550 align:start position:0%
not up to the supreme court it's up to
hhs

03:15:12.550 --> 03:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
hhs
 
03:15:14.229 --> 03:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
well there's a case before the supreme
 
03:15:16.229 --> 03:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
court there may be though okay there may
 
03:15:18.150 --> 03:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
be but that's not
 
03:15:20.469 --> 03:15:20.479 align:start position:0%
well i just just i mean i i agree that
 
03:15:22.150 --> 03:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
the term weather
 
03:15:23.670 --> 03:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
you can interpret it one way and you
 
03:15:26.229 --> 03:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
could interpret it in another way uh and
 
03:15:28.150 --> 03:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
i think our intent
 
03:15:30.630 --> 03:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
would be uh to clarify it by saying
 
03:15:33.910 --> 03:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
shall not of fact one way or the other
 
03:15:36.550 --> 03:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
weather all right so can i give you guys
 
03:15:38.790 --> 03:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
ask a follow-up uh
 
03:15:41.510 --> 03:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
listen i think all of us non-legal
 
03:15:41.520 --> 03:15:42.469 align:start position:0%
listen i think all of us non-legal
people

03:15:42.469 --> 03:15:42.479 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:15:45.269 --> 03:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
need to leave the room
 
03:15:47.190 --> 03:15:47.200 align:start position:0%
and let you guys
 
03:15:50.710 --> 03:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
please don't leave we need you
 
03:15:53.269 --> 03:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
let you guys figure this out go ahead
 
03:15:55.349 --> 03:15:55.359 align:start position:0%
but so my question i guess is this if
 
03:15:57.910 --> 03:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
you want if if you want to leave it up
 
03:15:59.670 --> 03:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
to the supreme court
 
03:16:01.750 --> 03:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
to you know what whatever they're do i
 
03:16:05.349 --> 03:16:05.359 align:start position:0%
mean if if if dhs is wrong in what in
 
03:16:06.710 --> 03:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
the way they're doing and you may be
 
03:16:08.870 --> 03:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely right i mean i as i you know
 
03:16:10.309 --> 03:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
without getting into the whole details
 
03:16:11.830 --> 03:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
of it it sounds like you've got a pretty
 
03:16:13.830 --> 03:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
good argument that you think so you won
 
03:16:15.830 --> 03:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
in this period right so if you're so if
 
03:16:17.750 --> 03:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
you're right
 
03:16:20.070 --> 03:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
then why do we need to do why do we need
 
03:16:22.389 --> 03:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
to to either have this amendment or even
 
03:16:24.150 --> 03:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
have the language in provision of such
 
03:16:26.070 --> 03:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
services why don't you just take both of
 
03:16:27.670 --> 03:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
those out and
 
03:16:29.190 --> 03:16:29.200 align:start position:0%
you know if you're right you'll win your
 
03:16:31.030 --> 03:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
lawsuit and this and the state will have
 
03:16:33.990 --> 03:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
to provide those services up through
 
03:16:38.710 --> 03:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:38.720 --> 03:16:40.630 align:start position:0%
 
well

03:16:40.630 --> 03:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:16:42.150 --> 03:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
i think i'm not sure we're going to see
 
03:16:44.229 --> 03:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
eye to eye on this i think it would be
 
03:16:46.950 --> 03:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
okay to not to do what you're talking
 
03:16:49.990 --> 03:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
about um because it does purely leave
 
03:16:51.830 --> 03:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
everything up to
 
03:16:53.910 --> 03:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
you know who is now going to be the
 
03:16:56.389 --> 03:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
decision maker i'm not sure that my
 
03:16:58.150 --> 03:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
colleague would feel the same way
 
03:17:00.630 --> 03:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
because i think there's a concern that
 
03:17:02.870 --> 03:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
area agencies aren't
 
03:17:04.710 --> 03:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
doing what they need to be doing for
 
03:17:06.150 --> 03:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
students with developmental disabilities
 
03:17:08.870 --> 03:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
so i i don't want to speak for you but i
 
03:17:11.590 --> 03:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
think but as i've said we cannot solve
 
03:17:12.870 --> 03:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
that problem
 
03:17:12.880 --> 03:17:13.670 align:start position:0%
that problem
yeah

03:17:13.670 --> 03:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:17:15.670 --> 03:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
and that's why we specifically tried to
 
03:17:18.309 --> 03:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
make it as even-handed as possible yeah
 
03:17:21.510 --> 03:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
um so right well as as i'm trying to
 
03:17:24.229 --> 03:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
rerun the reel here today i think what
 
03:17:29.110 --> 03:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
we're proposing was a reaction to
 
03:17:32.070 --> 03:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
mary's good intention of putting in
 
03:17:34.710 --> 03:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
that last sentence
 
03:17:37.110 --> 03:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
of her proposed amendment and our
 
03:17:39.030 --> 03:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
concern was that that last sentence
 
03:17:41.030 --> 03:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
might be misinterpreted
 
03:17:44.469 --> 03:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
as just creating an exception for one
 
03:17:46.070 --> 03:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
school year
 
03:17:48.630 --> 03:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm i think
 
03:17:51.110 --> 03:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
offhand that representative lynn is
 
03:17:51.120 --> 03:17:52.150 align:start position:0%
offhand that representative lynn is
correct

03:17:52.150 --> 03:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:17:56.309 --> 03:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
and that the better thing to do is just
 
03:17:59.269 --> 03:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
scratch the amendment
 
03:18:01.030 --> 03:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
i mean by scratching your members
 
03:18:03.190 --> 03:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
just you could just you could remove the
 
03:18:05.429 --> 03:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
last sentence and that would have saved
 
03:18:07.750 --> 03:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
us you know 50 minutes of drafting for
 
03:18:07.760 --> 03:18:11.110 align:start position:0%
us you know 50 minutes of drafting for
you

03:18:11.110 --> 03:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:13.510 --> 03:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
no no no just get rid of that last
 
03:18:16.150 --> 03:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
no no no just that less you need you
 
03:18:18.150 --> 03:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
need the amendment for funding to defray
 
03:18:19.830 --> 03:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
the cost to the school districts but you
 
03:18:22.469 --> 03:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
could take out that last sentence
 
03:18:25.830 --> 03:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
um which i i i understand the intent
 
03:18:28.070 --> 03:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
here but it's but it seems like it may
 
03:18:30.429 --> 03:18:30.439 align:start position:0%
be more problematic than it's worth just
 
03:18:33.429 --> 03:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
clarification when you say you you don't
 
03:18:35.269 --> 03:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
we can we can delete this handwritten
 
03:18:37.190 --> 03:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
amendment you can shred that you can get
 
03:18:38.950 --> 03:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
rid of that yes you can get rid of the
 
03:18:38.960 --> 03:18:39.990 align:start position:0%
rid of that yes you can get rid of the
handwritten

03:18:39.990 --> 03:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
handwritten
 
03:18:42.469 --> 03:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
all you need to all you need to do is
 
03:18:44.389 --> 03:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
and take out the last section the last
 
03:18:47.349 --> 03:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
sentence exactly lines 17 and 18. so it
 
03:18:49.750 --> 03:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
just clears up any ambi what what i
 
03:18:51.510 --> 03:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
think there was such a good intent here
 
03:18:53.830 --> 03:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
but it creates a lot of ambiguity about
 
03:18:56.229 --> 03:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
eligibility for developmental services
 
03:18:57.190 --> 03:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:18:59.750 --> 03:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
you came of course you came up with the
 
03:19:02.710 --> 03:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
cleanest way to deal with the ambiguity
 
03:19:05.030 --> 03:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
um which would be just to remove it and
 
03:19:06.790 --> 03:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
then we'll see what the new hampshire
 
03:19:09.670 --> 03:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
supreme court does and um
 
03:19:09.680 --> 03:19:10.630 align:start position:0%
supreme court does and um
yeah

03:19:10.630 --> 03:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:19:12.229 --> 03:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:19:14.070 --> 03:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
i i think i think that's probably the
 
03:19:16.550 --> 03:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
easiest thing to do you'd go with that
 
03:19:16.560 --> 03:19:18.150 align:start position:0%
easiest thing to do you'd go with that
yeah

03:19:18.150 --> 03:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:19:19.750 --> 03:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative heath are you okay with
 
03:19:19.760 --> 03:19:20.790 align:start position:0%
representative heath are you okay with
that

03:19:20.790 --> 03:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:19:22.790 --> 03:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
turn your mic on
 
03:19:25.830 --> 03:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
turn your mic on
 
03:19:27.269 --> 03:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
my understanding i was thinking what i
 
03:19:29.429 --> 03:19:29.439 align:start position:0%
was going to say
 
03:19:33.590 --> 03:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
my understanding then is that
 
03:19:35.990 --> 03:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment now
 
03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:37.429 align:start position:0%
this amendment now
for

03:19:37.429 --> 03:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:19:40.630 --> 03:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
the 22-23 school year
 
03:19:43.110 --> 03:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
and the completion
 
03:19:44.469 --> 03:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
we've got two school years here we've
 
03:19:47.429 --> 03:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
got 22 and then we're going to have 23.
 
03:19:50.950 --> 03:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
so for the completion of 22 and for the
 
03:19:52.950 --> 03:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
department of ed
 
03:19:55.990 --> 03:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
we're all of 23
 
03:19:56.000 --> 03:19:56.870 align:start position:0%
we're all of 23
okay

03:19:56.870 --> 03:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:19:58.710 --> 03:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
but and 22 as well
 
03:20:00.630 --> 03:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
yeah well the school year starts in
 
03:20:04.710 --> 03:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
september which is still 22. okay
 
03:20:08.229 --> 03:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
right right so that there will be
 
03:20:08.239 --> 03:20:09.349 align:start position:0%
right right so that there will be
funding

03:20:09.349 --> 03:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
funding
 
03:20:12.389 --> 03:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:15.590 --> 03:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
and the concern that was raised was this
 
03:20:18.630 --> 03:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
would in senator khan's amendment was
 
03:20:21.269 --> 03:20:21.279 align:start position:0%
that this would negate their ability to
 
03:20:21.279 --> 03:20:23.030 align:start position:0%
that this would negate their ability to
access

03:20:23.030 --> 03:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
access
 
03:20:25.030 --> 03:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
sir adult services
 
03:20:29.030 --> 03:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
and so we're going to be silent on that
 
03:20:32.309 --> 03:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
well yeah i see what you're saying
 
03:20:34.870 --> 03:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
so was it okay to be silent on that
 
03:20:37.269 --> 03:20:37.279 align:start position:0%
i mean we were concerned that if we
 
03:20:39.269 --> 03:20:39.279 align:start position:0%
aren't definitive
 
03:20:39.279 --> 03:20:40.950 align:start position:0%
aren't definitive
that

03:20:40.950 --> 03:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:20:43.510 --> 03:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
a school and the services say we don't
 
03:20:45.750 --> 03:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
have to do anything until yeah you know
 
03:20:48.790 --> 03:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
what i hear you
 
03:20:49.750 --> 03:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
go back
 
03:20:51.670 --> 03:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
well i mean but
 
03:20:54.309 --> 03:20:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:56.389 --> 03:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
the way this amendment has written its
 
03:20:59.590 --> 03:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
own that that state that last line is
 
03:21:03.910 --> 03:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
only good for this 22 23 school year yes
 
03:21:06.150 --> 03:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
okay yes and so
 
03:21:07.910 --> 03:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
i don't it doesn't belong there anyway
 
03:21:10.389 --> 03:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
yeah that that's my i would agree with
 
03:21:10.399 --> 03:21:11.110 align:start position:0%
yeah that that's my i would agree with
that

03:21:11.110 --> 03:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:21:12.950 --> 03:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure
 
03:21:17.030 --> 03:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:23.429 --> 03:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:25.030 --> 03:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
i mean because
 
03:21:28.950 --> 03:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
the way the way the um
 
03:21:31.190 --> 03:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
the way the system is supposed to work
 
03:21:32.790 --> 03:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
okay we don't want to let them off the
 
03:21:34.870 --> 03:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
hook well they
 
03:21:37.269 --> 03:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
the way it's supposed to work is
 
03:21:40.070 --> 03:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
when they reach whatever age it is
 
03:21:42.389 --> 03:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
and they graduate from high school
 
03:21:45.030 --> 03:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
then it's a transition it's
 
03:21:47.830 --> 03:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
it's all that part of
 
03:21:50.830 --> 03:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
you know the transition which i which
 
03:21:53.190 --> 03:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
hhs is supposed to pick up because it
 
03:21:55.510 --> 03:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it shouldn't just say oops i'm
 
03:21:58.790 --> 03:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
21 end of school year and now
 
03:22:00.070 --> 03:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
somebody talked to me from adult
 
03:22:02.150 --> 03:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
services that conversation should have
 
03:22:04.950 --> 03:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
been going on and i and i agree and i
 
03:22:07.190 --> 03:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
think that what i've heard
 
03:22:10.229 --> 03:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
is that it is going on
 
03:22:10.239 --> 03:22:11.500 align:start position:0%
is that it is going on
and

03:22:11.500 --> 03:22:11.510 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:22:11.510 --> 03:22:12.710 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

03:22:12.710 --> 03:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:22:15.590 --> 03:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
you know it may not be up to
 
03:22:17.510 --> 03:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
where we think it should be
 
03:22:20.469 --> 03:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
but at least in many cases it is going
 
03:22:20.479 --> 03:22:21.590 align:start position:0%
but at least in many cases it is going
on

03:22:21.590 --> 03:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:22:21.600 --> 03:22:23.269 align:start position:0%
on
okay

03:22:23.269 --> 03:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:22:24.790 --> 03:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
this is a really tough nut to crack
 
03:22:26.710 --> 03:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
because you've got these two different
 
03:22:26.720 --> 03:22:28.070 align:start position:0%
because you've got these two different
systems

03:22:28.070 --> 03:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
systems
 
03:22:33.269 --> 03:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:35.349 --> 03:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
how do we make it work
 
03:22:35.359 --> 03:22:36.150 align:start position:0%
how do we make it work
well

03:22:36.150 --> 03:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:22:38.790 --> 03:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
i think that that would be something for
 
03:22:41.269 --> 03:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
legislation next year
 
03:22:44.229 --> 03:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
okay how do we make it work
 
03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
okay we've been trying for how many
 
03:22:49.990 --> 03:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
years well i i'm just saying that
 
03:22:52.070 --> 03:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
if you know that's the kind of
 
03:22:54.150 --> 03:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
legislation i believe that we need for
 
03:22:56.229 --> 03:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
next year so
 
03:22:59.269 --> 03:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
and i'll i'll sign on good so this one
 
03:23:01.510 --> 03:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
means that
 
03:23:03.670 --> 03:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
susie smith
 
03:23:05.429 --> 03:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
can stay in school because her
 
03:23:07.670 --> 03:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
birthday's in october and she can stay
 
03:23:09.269 --> 03:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
till the end of the school year or she
 
03:23:11.510 --> 03:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
gets stages he's 22
 
03:23:11.520 --> 03:23:12.389 align:start position:0%
gets stages he's 22
right

03:23:12.389 --> 03:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:23:13.750 --> 03:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
but probably it'll be the end of the
 
03:23:15.269 --> 03:23:15.279 align:start position:0%
school year because then hopefully the
 
03:23:17.990 --> 03:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
adult services will take her once once
 
03:23:21.190 --> 03:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
she once she once she leaves school
 
03:23:23.269 --> 03:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
whether that's when she's 18 or 22
 
03:23:24.550 --> 03:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
that's one thing that's not up for
 
03:23:26.469 --> 03:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
debate we know that when she exits
 
03:23:28.950 --> 03:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
school that developmental services must
 
03:23:32.070 --> 03:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
kick in what's up what's right now
 
03:23:33.910 --> 03:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
in flux is whether developmental
 
03:23:36.229 --> 03:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
services need to kick in
 
03:23:37.670 --> 03:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
sooner than that
 
03:23:37.680 --> 03:23:38.950 align:start position:0%
sooner than that
and

03:23:38.950 --> 03:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:23:41.590 --> 03:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
i think they can you know and i so
 
03:23:43.190 --> 03:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
03:23:44.790 --> 03:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's not perfect
 
03:23:45.670 --> 03:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
at all
 
03:23:48.309 --> 03:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
because it because it could
 
03:23:48.319 --> 03:23:49.110 align:start position:0%
because it because it could
um

03:23:49.110 --> 03:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:52.550 --> 03:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
provide some motivation for you know not
 
03:23:55.110 --> 03:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
great treatment of kids with students
 
03:23:56.229 --> 03:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
older students with developmental
 
03:23:56.239 --> 03:23:57.590 align:start position:0%
older students with developmental
disabilities

03:23:57.590 --> 03:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
03:23:57.600 --> 03:23:59.030 align:start position:0%
disabilities
um

03:23:59.030 --> 03:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:02.070 --> 03:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
so i guess that you know
 
03:24:03.590 --> 03:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
but what that would entail would be
 
03:24:07.030 --> 03:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
really rewriting 171 a to make that
 
03:24:09.510 --> 03:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
really super clear so this gets us
 
03:24:11.429 --> 03:24:11.439 align:start position:0%
through now it gets us through now there
 
03:24:13.510 --> 03:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
is also you know this pilot we're
 
03:24:15.510 --> 03:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
looking at a pilot program
 
03:24:19.349 --> 03:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
um in sb 430 that um
 
03:24:23.510 --> 03:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
may create some state funding and um
 
03:24:23.520 --> 03:24:24.229 align:start position:0%
may create some state funding and um
to

03:24:24.229 --> 03:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:24:25.990 --> 03:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
well you know go part of the way to make
 
03:24:27.349 --> 03:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
sure there's funding available for
 
03:24:32.389 --> 03:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:36.630 --> 03:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:40.309 --> 03:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
okay so we're going to add
 
03:24:40.319 --> 03:24:41.750 align:start position:0%
okay so we're going to add
uh

03:24:41.750 --> 03:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:24:43.910 --> 03:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
something about birthday
 
03:24:45.349 --> 03:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
in line 2
 
03:24:46.870 --> 03:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
or line 11
 
03:24:48.710 --> 03:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
and we're going to eliminate the last
 
03:24:48.720 --> 03:24:52.710 align:start position:0%
and we're going to eliminate the last
sentence

03:24:52.710 --> 03:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:55.030 --> 03:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
so i also have a couple other
 
03:24:57.030 --> 03:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
not to continue the conversation but
 
03:24:58.150 --> 03:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
things that probably should be
 
03:25:03.510 --> 03:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:05.830 --> 03:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
we we anticipate at this time that there
 
03:25:08.229 --> 03:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
there probably would be ample funding or
 
03:25:09.910 --> 03:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
sufficient funding
 
03:25:11.750 --> 03:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
in this what's already been budgeted to
 
03:25:13.990 --> 03:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
cover these costs however there's
 
03:25:16.710 --> 03:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
nothing in this language that would
 
03:25:18.630 --> 03:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
provide any sort of direction for the
 
03:25:20.309 --> 03:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
department if there was not enough money
 
03:25:21.590 --> 03:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
there as far as whether this
 
03:25:23.750 --> 03:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement would be prorated
 
03:25:25.670 --> 03:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
or whether you wanted to create some
 
03:25:27.750 --> 03:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
sort of an access for the department to
 
03:25:29.670 --> 03:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
draw a warrant to cover if the costs are
 
03:25:31.510 --> 03:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
in excess of what they actually have on
 
03:25:34.309 --> 03:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
hand i have no problem with drawing a
 
03:25:36.950 --> 03:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
warrant okay so if we could do that that
 
03:25:39.269 --> 03:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
it would be uh any any amounts that
 
03:25:41.830 --> 03:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
exceed what they have available from the
 
03:25:44.070 --> 03:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
special education line no we have to we
 
03:25:46.070 --> 03:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
should put that money that dollar figure
 
03:25:47.830 --> 03:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
in there well we that's what i'm
 
03:25:49.750 --> 03:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
thinking is right now i don't i don't
 
03:25:51.190 --> 03:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
anticipate needing to so we wouldn't
 
03:25:52.550 --> 03:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
have an estimate i think based on
 
03:25:53.990 --> 03:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
estimates we have it probably would be
 
03:25:56.469 --> 03:25:56.479 align:start position:0%
covered by the catastrophic age no i'm
 
03:25:59.030 --> 03:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
saying how much they're going to pony up
 
03:26:01.510 --> 03:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
which was 1.4 million
 
03:26:04.710 --> 03:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
for this year we have 1.4 for next year
 
03:26:06.070 --> 03:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure it's too early to know what
 
03:26:07.830 --> 03:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement for fiscal 23. so
 
03:26:10.070 --> 03:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
it'll be 1.4 plus something to pay for
 
03:26:12.309 --> 03:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
this reimbursement so we don't have a
 
03:26:14.790 --> 03:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
full number yet as to what may be on
 
03:26:16.950 --> 03:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
hand but i think just having a mechanism
 
03:26:18.229 --> 03:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
in here for the department to draw a
 
03:26:21.030 --> 03:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
warrant if necessary um would be that
 
03:26:22.710 --> 03:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
way they don't have to chase a piece of
 
03:26:24.150 --> 03:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
legislation next year in case they were
 
03:26:27.910 --> 03:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
short make it very very if if if yes
 
03:26:27.920 --> 03:26:29.670 align:start position:0%
short make it very very if if if yes
absolutely

03:26:29.670 --> 03:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
03:26:31.670 --> 03:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is
 
03:26:33.190 --> 03:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
just to be clear are we keeping the
 
03:26:35.269 --> 03:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
definition that this reimbursable period
 
03:26:37.389 --> 03:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
would just be services during the
 
03:26:39.750 --> 03:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
2022-2023 school year because i know
 
03:26:41.349 --> 03:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
there was discussion of uh summer
 
03:26:43.110 --> 03:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
programs and i'm not sure if that was
 
03:26:45.269 --> 03:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to be included or not no
 
03:26:47.750 --> 03:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay okay because
 
03:26:50.550 --> 03:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
by the time this legislation
 
03:26:52.950 --> 03:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
finally passes gets signed
 
03:26:56.389 --> 03:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
or into summer programs and there's
 
03:26:59.269 --> 03:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
plenty of esra money out there for
 
03:27:01.030 --> 03:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
summer programs
 
03:27:01.040 --> 03:27:01.910 align:start position:0%
summer programs
so

03:27:01.910 --> 03:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:27:05.190 --> 03:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
there should be absolutely no reason why
 
03:27:07.429 --> 03:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
a school system can't
 
03:27:07.439 --> 03:27:09.510 align:start position:0%
a school system can't
manage

03:27:09.510 --> 03:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
manage
 
03:27:09.520 --> 03:27:10.870 align:start position:0%
manage
the

03:27:10.870 --> 03:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:27:12.469 --> 03:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
one or two
 
03:27:13.510 --> 03:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
03:27:15.830 --> 03:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
but if we're talking about cat a well
 
03:27:17.349 --> 03:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
special ed aid
 
03:27:19.269 --> 03:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
once a school district goes over that
 
03:27:22.630 --> 03:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
amount it's eligible for especially at
 
03:27:24.229 --> 03:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
eight right
 
03:27:24.239 --> 03:27:25.110 align:start position:0%
eight right
right

03:27:25.110 --> 03:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
right

areas that we looked at in our
 
03:35:03.269 --> 03:35:03.279 align:start position:0%
last review of
 
03:35:04.790 --> 03:35:04.800 align:start position:0%

nothing happened with
that

03:35:18.870 --> 03:35:18.880 align:start position:0%

03:36:44.469 --> 03:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:36:44.479 --> 03:36:47.190 align:start position:0%
okay
so

03:36:47.190 --> 03:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:47.200 --> 03:36:49.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:36:49.110 --> 03:36:49.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:50.790 --> 03:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
we'll get that free and reduced lunch
 
03:36:52.710 --> 03:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
thing straightened around
 
03:36:55.830 --> 03:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
again next year
 
03:36:58.710 --> 03:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
it's easy to say that but that's the
 
03:37:02.550 --> 03:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
best i can do
 
03:37:05.030 --> 03:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
because the senate stripped it out and
 
03:37:05.040 --> 03:37:06.550 align:start position:0%
because the senate stripped it out and
uh

03:37:06.550 --> 03:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:37:08.950 --> 03:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to
 
03:37:12.469 --> 03:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
i don't want to get in a fight over it
 
03:37:12.479 --> 03:37:13.510 align:start position:0%
i don't want to get in a fight over it
with

03:37:13.510 --> 03:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:37:15.510 --> 03:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
the senate again
 
03:37:19.590 --> 03:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:22.389 --> 03:37:22.399 align:start position:0%
uh and for those that are on division
 
03:37:22.399 --> 03:37:23.269 align:start position:0%
uh and for those that are on division
two

03:37:23.269 --> 03:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:37:27.590 --> 03:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
you remember we have hb is it 603
 
03:37:31.190 --> 03:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
yes okay that we have that we have an
 
03:37:32.950 --> 03:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
03:37:32.960 --> 03:37:33.830 align:start position:0%
interim study
so

03:37:33.830 --> 03:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:36.870 --> 03:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
we will be having some
 
03:37:36.880 --> 03:37:37.990 align:start position:0%
we will be having some
uh

03:37:37.990 --> 03:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:37:40.710 --> 03:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
interim study meetings on 603
 
03:37:40.720 --> 03:37:42.150 align:start position:0%
interim study meetings on 603
and

03:37:42.150 --> 03:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:37:42.160 --> 03:37:43.190 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:37:43.190 --> 03:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:45.510 --> 03:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that we'll
 
03:37:47.910 --> 03:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
look at in more detail
 
03:37:49.990 --> 03:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
is um
 
03:37:51.269 --> 03:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:37:53.990 --> 03:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
green reduced lunch thing
 
03:37:54.000 --> 03:37:56.309 align:start position:0%
green reduced lunch thing
so

03:37:56.309 --> 03:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:59.429 --> 03:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
i think we can't meet in july
 
03:38:01.750 --> 03:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
but we can meet in august so
 
03:38:04.309 --> 03:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
i'll schedule that for some time in
 
03:38:04.319 --> 03:38:05.670 align:start position:0%
i'll schedule that for some time in
august

03:38:05.670 --> 03:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
august
 
03:38:07.349 --> 03:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
and then we have another interim study
 
03:38:09.910 --> 03:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
bill which i'll schedule the same day so
 
03:38:09.920 --> 03:38:10.710 align:start position:0%
bill which i'll schedule the same day so
that

03:38:10.710 --> 03:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:38:13.590 --> 03:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
we're not down here six times
 
03:38:13.600 --> 03:38:14.630 align:start position:0%
we're not down here six times
okay

03:38:14.630 --> 03:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:38:14.640 --> 03:38:15.510 align:start position:0%
okay
so

03:38:15.510 --> 03:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:38:17.990 --> 03:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
the first amendment
 
03:38:18.000 --> 03:38:21.510 align:start position:0%
the first amendment
um

03:38:21.510 --> 03:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:25.510 --> 03:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
is a redefinition
 
03:38:34.630 --> 03:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:36.070 --> 03:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what
 
03:38:38.710 --> 03:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
subject to taxation under rsa
 
03:38:42.710 --> 03:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
82 is sure so uh mark is here from the
 
03:38:44.150 --> 03:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
department and this was something that
 
03:38:46.229 --> 03:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
they had identified as a
 
03:38:49.030 --> 03:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
technical fix to align the bill's intent
 
03:38:50.469 --> 03:38:50.479 align:start position:0%
with the data that was used for the
 
03:38:53.030 --> 03:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and the calculation so
 
03:38:54.710 --> 03:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
he could have better explain this than i
 
03:38:56.950 --> 03:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
can oh okay
 
03:39:08.710 --> 03:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:10.550 --> 03:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
mark manganiello administrator of school
 
03:39:12.630 --> 03:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
finance with the department of education
 
03:39:14.469 --> 03:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
um when we when senator hennessey was
 
03:39:15.990 --> 03:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
working on
 
03:39:18.550 --> 03:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
senate bill 420
 
03:39:20.309 --> 03:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
she kind of identified
 
03:39:22.550 --> 03:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
the concept of extraordinary needs grant
 
03:39:24.630 --> 03:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
and then she was
 
03:39:26.630 --> 03:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
so you she knew kind of what her
 
03:39:27.990 --> 03:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
objective was but then there was a lot
 
03:39:30.229 --> 03:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
of data sets moving around and the data
 
03:39:32.870 --> 03:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
sets on how it's based on uh
 
03:39:35.670 --> 03:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation per fnr students so
 
03:39:37.110 --> 03:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
that's the concept but then you have to
 
03:39:40.309 --> 03:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
define equalize valuation and we were
 
03:39:41.590 --> 03:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
running some spreadsheets and a lot of
 
03:39:43.990 --> 03:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
different data sets were moving around
 
03:39:44.000 --> 03:39:45.510 align:start position:0%
different data sets were moving around
and

03:39:45.510 --> 03:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:39:47.830 --> 03:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
in order to get the legislation to match
 
03:39:50.790 --> 03:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
the exact data set that she used in
 
03:39:53.429 --> 03:39:53.439 align:start position:0%
designing this grant um the technical
 
03:39:55.189 --> 03:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
amendment needs to go through
 
03:39:56.710 --> 03:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
if the technical amendment doesn't go
 
03:39:58.790 --> 03:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
through we still have a measurement of
 
03:40:00.550 --> 03:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation
 
03:40:01.830 --> 03:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
it would just produce a little bit
 
03:40:03.269 --> 03:40:03.279 align:start position:0%
different results it would actually cost
 
03:40:05.429 --> 03:40:05.439 align:start position:0%
instead of 14.7 million it would cost 15
 
03:40:05.439 --> 03:40:06.469 align:start position:0%
instead of 14.7 million it would cost 15
million

03:40:06.469 --> 03:40:06.479 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:40:07.910 --> 03:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
and so the difference between what the
 
03:40:09.590 --> 03:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
bill currently says
 
03:40:11.110 --> 03:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
the bill currently defines equalized
 
03:40:11.120 --> 03:40:12.710 align:start position:0%
the bill currently defines equalized
valuation

03:40:12.710 --> 03:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
valuation
 
03:40:14.710 --> 03:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
to exclude railroads
 
03:40:17.670 --> 03:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
and utilities but the way
 
03:40:20.550 --> 03:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
the original intent of it was to exclude
 
03:40:23.110 --> 03:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
railroads and payments in lieu of taxes
 
03:40:25.510 --> 03:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
so that's a particular type of property
 
03:40:28.550 --> 03:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's being defined there um and so in
 
03:40:29.990 --> 03:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
order to match
 
03:40:30.000 --> 03:40:30.870 align:start position:0%
order to match
uh

03:40:30.870 --> 03:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:40:32.630 --> 03:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
in order to have that definition match
 
03:40:34.389 --> 03:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
the data set use that's the does this
 
03:40:37.269 --> 03:40:37.279 align:start position:0%
definition match what dra says equalize
 
03:40:39.269 --> 03:40:39.279 align:start position:0%
valuation is
 
03:40:39.279 --> 03:40:40.630 align:start position:0%
valuation is
uh

03:40:40.630 --> 03:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:40:43.030 --> 03:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
it matches a data set they publish
 
03:40:44.830 --> 03:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
so the data is available
 
03:40:48.070 --> 03:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
okay so dra wouldn't have any problem
 
03:40:50.630 --> 03:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
with this definition uh i can't speak
 
03:40:52.229 --> 03:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
for them but the data is available they
 
03:40:54.150 --> 03:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
publish the exact column of data that we
 
03:40:55.429 --> 03:40:55.439 align:start position:0%
would be using because i use that data
 
03:40:59.830 --> 03:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:03.189 --> 03:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
is the right term equalized valuation
 
03:41:05.189 --> 03:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
or do i say
 
03:41:07.670 --> 03:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
a portion of the arrays equalize
 
03:41:07.680 --> 03:41:09.269 align:start position:0%
a portion of the arrays equalize
valuation

03:41:09.269 --> 03:41:09.279 align:start position:0%
valuation
 
03:41:09.279 --> 03:41:12.070 align:start position:0%
valuation
methodology

03:41:12.070 --> 03:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
methodology
 
03:41:16.389 --> 03:41:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:18.150 --> 03:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
mark can jump in here but i think the
 
03:41:19.750 --> 03:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
idea here was to
 
03:41:21.910 --> 03:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
use equalized valuation as a base but
 
03:41:23.429 --> 03:41:23.439 align:start position:0%
excluding certain
 
03:41:25.030 --> 03:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
components of that total overall
 
03:41:28.150 --> 03:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
municipal valuation so we are using a
 
03:41:28.160 --> 03:41:29.429 align:start position:0%
municipal valuation so we are using a
dra

03:41:29.429 --> 03:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
dra
 
03:41:31.670 --> 03:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
published determined equalized valuation
 
03:41:34.229 --> 03:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
less certain types of properties okay
 
03:41:38.550 --> 03:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:41.030 --> 03:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's um it's the wait it says excluding
 
03:41:41.040 --> 03:41:42.870 align:start position:0%
it's um it's the wait it says excluding
properties

03:41:42.870 --> 03:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
properties
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:51.269 --> 03:41:51.279 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the railroads correct
 
03:41:52.550 --> 03:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
correct yeah
 
03:41:54.389 --> 03:41:54.399 align:start position:0%
and the idea was to
 
03:41:54.399 --> 03:41:55.750 align:start position:0%
and the idea was to
understanding

03:41:55.750 --> 03:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
03:41:57.269 --> 03:41:57.279 align:start position:0%
the equalized valuations could be
 
03:41:59.189 --> 03:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
inflated perhaps moving inflate is not
 
03:42:00.469 --> 03:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
the right word but it was to reduce the
 
03:42:02.710 --> 03:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
valuation based on certain property
 
03:42:04.150 --> 03:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
types so
 
03:42:04.160 --> 03:42:06.309 align:start position:0%
types so
um

03:42:06.309 --> 03:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:07.750 --> 03:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
which i
 
03:42:09.590 --> 03:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
yeah at all in there i don't wanna
 
03:42:18.070 --> 03:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:18.080 --> 03:42:19.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:42:19.750 --> 03:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:42:21.510 --> 03:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
yeah certainly
 
03:42:23.349 --> 03:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so can i just that i
 
03:42:25.349 --> 03:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
understand they are excluded because
 
03:42:27.590 --> 03:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
they would artificially inflate
 
03:42:29.750 --> 03:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
property values in a community and we
 
03:42:31.750 --> 03:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
want to get a more true
 
03:42:34.229 --> 03:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
sense of what those valuations are to
 
03:42:35.670 --> 03:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
get a better understanding of the lower
 
03:42:38.469 --> 03:42:38.479 align:start position:0%
property values uh outside railroads
 
03:42:40.950 --> 03:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
i can't speak really it's really um the
 
03:42:42.229 --> 03:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
center would have to speak to it but
 
03:42:43.750 --> 03:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's really just the data set she was
 
03:42:44.950 --> 03:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
using there's a lot of different data
 
03:42:46.469 --> 03:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
sets and
 
03:42:48.309 --> 03:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
playing with the numbers she felt that
 
03:42:49.830 --> 03:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
the data set
 
03:42:51.990 --> 03:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
the data set that ultimately was used as
 
03:42:54.070 --> 03:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
the analysis the 14.7 million dollar
 
03:42:56.070 --> 03:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
analysis shows
 
03:42:59.910 --> 03:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
has excludes railroads excludes pilots
 
03:43:02.309 --> 03:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
and includes utilities so
 
03:43:04.469 --> 03:43:04.479 align:start position:0%
the purpose of that is to get a better
 
03:43:06.790 --> 03:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
actual evaluation of what the properties
 
03:43:08.630 --> 03:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
are in that community but it's included
 
03:43:10.309 --> 03:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
in this
 
03:43:12.870 --> 03:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
it it it just makes it
 
03:43:15.189 --> 03:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
i would say yes
 
03:43:15.199 --> 03:43:16.630 align:start position:0%
i would say yes
okay

03:43:16.630 --> 03:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:43:18.790 --> 03:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you to the extent that the
 
03:43:18.800 --> 03:43:20.950 align:start position:0%
thank you to the extent that the
equalizer

03:43:20.950 --> 03:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
equalizer
 
03:43:22.550 --> 03:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
number goes down if you if you're
 
03:43:24.630 --> 03:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
reducing other components the possible
 
03:43:26.150 --> 03:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
grants would go up just naturally the
 
03:43:29.590 --> 03:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:29.600 --> 03:43:30.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:43:30.870 --> 03:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:43:32.950 --> 03:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm not i'm not sure whether i'm
 
03:43:34.710 --> 03:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
going to let you ask any questions well
 
03:43:35.830 --> 03:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
03:43:38.389 --> 03:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm not i'm not quite sure i
 
03:43:40.309 --> 03:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
understand the rationale in other in
 
03:43:41.990 --> 03:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
other words
 
03:43:43.910 --> 03:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
for example in a community like beau
 
03:43:45.830 --> 03:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
which has the power plant
 
03:43:47.910 --> 03:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
if it would be my understanding that
 
03:43:50.389 --> 03:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
that would contribute
 
03:43:52.870 --> 03:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
a lot to sort of the wealth of the town
 
03:43:54.950 --> 03:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
in the sense that to the extent
 
03:43:56.309 --> 03:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
it pays
 
03:43:58.870 --> 03:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
higher taxes it pays a lot of the of the
 
03:44:00.870 --> 03:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
town's percentage of taxes that means
 
03:44:04.150 --> 03:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
that other taxpayers in the town pay
 
03:44:05.990 --> 03:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know relative
 
03:44:08.550 --> 03:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh proportionally less and so why should
 
03:44:08.560 --> 03:44:09.670 align:start position:0%
uh proportionally less and so why should
that

03:44:09.670 --> 03:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:44:11.269 --> 03:44:11.279 align:start position:0%
so that's yeah that's a good point uh so
 
03:44:12.870 --> 03:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
just using utilities and bow as an
 
03:44:15.670 --> 03:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
example so in the bill as the way it's
 
03:44:17.910 --> 03:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
drafted which was not the exact attempt
 
03:44:20.469 --> 03:44:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh intent of the senator it
 
03:44:23.590 --> 03:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
it excludes utilities so that wealth is
 
03:44:26.630 --> 03:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
not captured as part of the equation so
 
03:44:26.640 --> 03:44:27.510 align:start position:0%
not captured as part of the equation so
um

03:44:27.510 --> 03:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:28.710 --> 03:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
so bo
 
03:44:30.229 --> 03:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
bo in that situation when you take out
 
03:44:33.269 --> 03:44:33.279 align:start position:0%
the utilities it seems like a
 
03:44:35.830 --> 03:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
a less wealthy property town
 
03:44:37.110 --> 03:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
but now we're including it this
 
03:44:38.950 --> 03:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
amendment would include those utilities
 
03:44:40.790 --> 03:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
so now it
 
03:44:42.150 --> 03:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
kind of like what representative murray
 
03:44:43.510 --> 03:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
was talking about it would more
 
03:44:46.070 --> 03:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
accurately grab more valuation data and
 
03:44:47.750 --> 03:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
more accurately tell us something more
 
03:44:49.510 --> 03:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
about the property values of that town
 
03:44:49.520 --> 03:44:50.389 align:start position:0%
about the property values of that town
okay

03:44:50.389 --> 03:44:50.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:44:53.349 --> 03:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
uh it currently excludes 83f rsa83f
 
03:44:55.030 --> 03:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
which is utilities but the amendment
 
03:44:56.550 --> 03:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
would bring them back in
 
03:44:59.590 --> 03:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
by not excluding them i okay i see all
 
03:45:03.030 --> 03:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
right so so within and 82 is the are our
 
03:45:07.110 --> 03:45:07.120 align:start position:0%
railroads yep okay and i assume that
 
03:45:09.030 --> 03:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
railroads actually do bring that because
 
03:45:10.790 --> 03:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
they're not basically in operation or at
 
03:45:12.630 --> 03:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
least not much that brings down the
 
03:45:13.910 --> 03:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
there's no yeah there's not a lot of
 
03:45:15.429 --> 03:45:15.439 align:start position:0%
money all right yeah utilities are i
 
03:45:17.030 --> 03:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
think are larger chunk of money sure
 
03:45:18.870 --> 03:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
sure no i understand thank you thanks
 
03:45:23.590 --> 03:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:25.269 --> 03:45:25.279 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions on this
 
03:45:25.279 --> 03:45:27.110 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions on this
amendment

03:45:27.110 --> 03:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:45:27.120 --> 03:45:28.469 align:start position:0%
amendment
yeah

03:45:28.469 --> 03:45:28.479 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:45:30.309 --> 03:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
03:45:32.150 --> 03:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:45:32.160 --> 03:45:33.910 align:start position:0%
all right
so

03:45:33.910 --> 03:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:45:33.920 --> 03:45:35.110 align:start position:0%
so
on

03:45:35.110 --> 03:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:45:35.120 --> 03:45:36.389 align:start position:0%
on
uh

03:45:36.389 --> 03:45:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:45:36.399 --> 03:45:40.150 align:start position:0%
uh
1727

thank you
 
03:46:07.110 --> 03:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
we don't need a roll call no no we'll
 
03:46:09.990 --> 03:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
we'll do the roll call as amended
 
03:46:12.790 --> 03:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
okay the next amendment
 
03:46:16.309 --> 03:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:16.319 --> 03:46:18.870 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:46:18.870 --> 03:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:46:20.710 --> 03:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
we want to
 
03:46:25.110 --> 03:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:31.750 --> 03:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:34.309 --> 03:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
the reason the title needs to be amended
 
03:46:38.469 --> 03:46:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:40.389 --> 03:46:40.399 align:start position:0%
line five
 
03:46:42.950 --> 03:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
which says amend the bill by deleting
 
03:46:44.710 --> 03:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
section four
 
03:46:47.590 --> 03:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
which is the um
 
03:46:53.030 --> 03:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:53.040 --> 03:46:54.630 align:start position:0%
 
grants

03:46:54.630 --> 03:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
grants
 
03:46:54.640 --> 03:46:57.030 align:start position:0%
grants
and

03:46:57.030 --> 03:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:46:59.429 --> 03:46:59.439 align:start position:0%
i explained to
 
03:47:01.750 --> 03:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
the education committee
 
03:47:01.760 --> 03:47:02.870 align:start position:0%
the education committee
that

03:47:02.870 --> 03:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:47:05.349 --> 03:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
we could do one or the other but i can't
 
03:47:07.429 --> 03:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
do both
 
03:47:07.439 --> 03:47:08.710 align:start position:0%
do both
okay

03:47:08.710 --> 03:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:47:10.550 --> 03:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
if they want to bring it back into the
 
03:47:12.870 --> 03:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
budget next year depending upon
 
03:47:14.710 --> 03:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
how much
 
03:47:17.269 --> 03:47:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh you know what our revenues are
 
03:47:19.110 --> 03:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
projected to be then
 
03:47:22.070 --> 03:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
we can look at it at that time but
 
03:47:23.830 --> 03:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
at this point in time
 
03:47:26.469 --> 03:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
we're committing ourselves to
 
03:47:26.479 --> 03:47:27.750 align:start position:0%
we're committing ourselves to
roughly

03:47:27.750 --> 03:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
03:47:27.760 --> 03:47:29.070 align:start position:0%
roughly
4.

03:47:29.070 --> 03:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
4.
 
03:47:31.110 --> 03:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
14.5 million
 
03:47:31.120 --> 03:47:32.790 align:start position:0%
14.5 million
extra

03:47:32.790 --> 03:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
extra
 
03:47:32.800 --> 03:47:33.830 align:start position:0%
extra
in

03:47:33.830 --> 03:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:47:35.670 --> 03:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
in the budget so
 
03:47:38.150 --> 03:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
i thought that that was about as much as
 
03:47:41.110 --> 03:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
my heart could stand
 
03:47:41.120 --> 03:47:41.910 align:start position:0%
my heart could stand
so

03:47:41.910 --> 03:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:47:44.710 --> 03:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
that's what uh that's what
 
03:47:47.189 --> 03:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
this bill does or this this amendment
 
03:47:47.199 --> 03:47:49.429 align:start position:0%
this bill does or this this amendment
does

03:47:49.429 --> 03:47:49.439 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:47:52.389 --> 03:47:52.399 align:start position:0%
on page two it's taking out from line 33
 
03:47:52.399 --> 03:47:53.510 align:start position:0%
on page two it's taking out from line 33
until

03:47:53.510 --> 03:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
until
 
03:48:04.870 --> 03:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:04.880 --> 03:48:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
page

03:48:05.750 --> 03:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:48:07.670 --> 03:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
page two
 
03:48:09.830 --> 03:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
line thirty three
 
03:48:23.590 --> 03:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:26.150 --> 03:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
to the end
 
03:48:29.990 --> 03:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:41.990 --> 03:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:43.750 --> 03:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
and it leaves all the stuff in there
 
03:48:45.110 --> 03:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
from the
 
03:48:53.189 --> 03:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:56.950 --> 03:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
this is uh deleting from line 33
 
03:48:59.429 --> 03:48:59.439 align:start position:0%
and over on to the next page

all right now to
 
03:49:39.910 --> 03:49:39.920 align:start position:0%

03:49:47.670 --> 03:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
so represent turcotte i know you have a
 
03:49:47.680 --> 03:49:49.349 align:start position:0%
so represent turcotte i know you have a
question

03:49:49.349 --> 03:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:49:52.870 --> 03:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
i have many madam chair oh um okay
 
03:49:54.389 --> 03:49:54.399 align:start position:0%
so you're gonna have to excuse my
 
03:49:56.469 --> 03:49:56.479 align:start position:0%
ignorance i'm still
 
03:49:58.389 --> 03:49:58.399 align:start position:0%
that's okay mark why don't you come back
 
03:50:03.429 --> 03:50:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:17.110 --> 03:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:17.120 --> 03:50:21.269 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:50:21.269 --> 03:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:24.389 --> 03:50:24.399 align:start position:0%
we are estimating that this
 
03:50:27.590 --> 03:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs grant is going to
 
03:50:28.790 --> 03:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
cost somewhere
 
03:50:31.510 --> 03:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
around 15 million 14 15 million or
 
03:50:33.429 --> 03:50:33.439 align:start position:0%
whatever okay
 
03:50:35.269 --> 03:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
let's start with a real basic question
 
03:50:38.710 --> 03:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
where's that revenue coming from
 
03:50:40.550 --> 03:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
it would come from the education trust
 
03:50:40.560 --> 03:50:42.309 align:start position:0%
it would come from the education trust
fund

03:50:42.309 --> 03:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
fund
 
03:50:44.550 --> 03:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
and that money comes from
 
03:50:47.030 --> 03:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
business taxes
 
03:50:49.990 --> 03:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh lottery tobacco tax
 
03:50:52.389 --> 03:50:52.399 align:start position:0%
a lot of sources does any of that come
 
03:50:54.229 --> 03:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
from the towns themselves
 
03:50:58.389 --> 03:50:58.399 align:start position:0%
the swept at 300 363 million dollars and
 
03:51:00.469 --> 03:51:00.479 align:start position:0%
22 uh 300
 
03:51:04.630 --> 03:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
to 263 dollars in fiscal year 23. um
 
03:51:07.030 --> 03:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
that comes from uh
 
03:51:08.229 --> 03:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
it's raised and retained in the town it
 
03:51:09.990 --> 03:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
goes from a municipal tax collector
 
03:51:12.150 --> 03:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
right to the school district but we
 
03:51:13.910 --> 03:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
count we write that on our ledgers on
 
03:51:15.510 --> 03:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund does that money
 
03:51:17.110 --> 03:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
coming into the state and directly going
 
03:51:19.910 --> 03:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
out to the state back to the towns
 
03:51:22.469 --> 03:51:22.479 align:start position:0%
that was my understanding okay so my
 
03:51:24.150 --> 03:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
question then becomes
 
03:51:26.870 --> 03:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
the distribution on the the sheets here
 
03:51:29.349 --> 03:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that's still relatively
 
03:51:32.950 --> 03:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:32.960 --> 03:51:37.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:51:37.990 --> 03:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:42.550 --> 03:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:44.630 --> 03:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
that in some way
 
03:51:46.790 --> 03:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm my understanding is there's
 
03:51:51.830 --> 03:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
al already uh through the swept um a
 
03:51:55.110 --> 03:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
call it a redistribution of
 
03:51:57.510 --> 03:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
no mickey's
 
03:51:59.990 --> 03:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
saying i see his head shaking no
 
03:52:03.110 --> 03:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay there is no redistribution
 
03:52:03.120 --> 03:52:05.830 align:start position:0%
okay there is no redistribution
adequacy

03:52:05.830 --> 03:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:08.309 --> 03:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
is that not a
 
03:52:10.790 --> 03:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
so in the terms of swept
 
03:52:13.030 --> 03:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh even if a municipality portion of a
 
03:52:15.750 --> 03:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
swept exceeds their cost of a adequate
 
03:52:17.830 --> 03:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
education or calculated grant they still
 
03:52:19.990 --> 03:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
retain that money it does not get
 
03:52:23.429 --> 03:52:23.439 align:start position:0%
turned over to the state or reallocated
 
03:52:26.389 --> 03:52:26.399 align:start position:0%
but i am i understanding this that what
 
03:52:28.630 --> 03:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
happens is there's going to be
 
03:52:31.510 --> 03:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
um out of that fund there's going to be
 
03:52:34.229 --> 03:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of towns that are not going to be
 
03:52:36.150 --> 03:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
and i understand that's the whole just
 
03:52:37.990 --> 03:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
to the idea but there's going to be a
 
03:52:40.070 --> 03:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
lot of towns
 
03:52:42.469 --> 03:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:52:45.269 --> 03:52:45.279 align:start position:0%
are gonna be receiving nothing
 
03:52:47.269 --> 03:52:47.279 align:start position:0%
yep the fiscal note shows which towns
 
03:52:50.229 --> 03:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
will receive right zero funding yeah
 
03:52:50.239 --> 03:52:51.910 align:start position:0%
will receive right zero funding yeah
right

03:52:51.910 --> 03:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:52:54.469 --> 03:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:52:56.790 --> 03:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
and and the zero funding is based on the
 
03:52:58.870 --> 03:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
fact that uh
 
03:53:00.070 --> 03:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
they have
 
03:53:02.469 --> 03:53:02.479 align:start position:0%
they have capacity
 
03:53:04.229 --> 03:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
is that the right term
 
03:53:06.830 --> 03:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:09.349 --> 03:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
whatever the difference between what the
 
03:53:12.309 --> 03:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
state provides and what
 
03:53:15.269 --> 03:53:15.279 align:start position:0%
so in effect donor versus non-donor town
 
03:53:17.349 --> 03:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
even though that's not what's happening
 
03:53:17.359 --> 03:53:18.790 align:start position:0%
even though that's not what's happening
but

03:53:18.790 --> 03:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:53:20.550 --> 03:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
in a roundabout way it's just that some
 
03:53:22.790 --> 03:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
towns are
 
03:53:29.910 --> 03:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:29.920 --> 03:53:30.790 align:start position:0%
 
sure

03:53:30.790 --> 03:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:53:32.950 --> 03:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
so my only my only question is not a
 
03:53:35.110 --> 03:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
legal question well
 
03:53:37.590 --> 03:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
my question i guess is this
 
03:53:40.389 --> 03:53:40.399 align:start position:0%
is there anything about what we're doing
 
03:53:42.950 --> 03:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
here this formula
 
03:53:42.960 --> 03:53:44.229 align:start position:0%
here this formula
that

03:53:44.229 --> 03:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:53:47.269 --> 03:53:47.279 align:start position:0%
in some way is sort of inconsistent with
 
03:53:48.830 --> 03:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
the educational
 
03:53:48.840 --> 03:53:50.389 align:start position:0%
the educational
adequacy

03:53:50.389 --> 03:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
03:53:52.229 --> 03:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
that we're you know that we're supposed
 
03:53:54.710 --> 03:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
to provide via the the claremont
 
03:53:56.309 --> 03:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
decision so that
 
03:53:58.070 --> 03:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
this will
 
03:53:59.590 --> 03:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:54:02.229 --> 03:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
hurt hurt our position in litigation in
 
03:54:03.429 --> 03:54:03.439 align:start position:0%
the in the
 
03:54:04.950 --> 03:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
in the claremont case in somewhere i
 
03:54:06.309 --> 03:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
mean i just don't know maybe it'll help
 
03:54:08.469 --> 03:54:08.479 align:start position:0%
it i'll i'll i'll tell i'll just uh
 
03:54:09.990 --> 03:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's getting close to a legal question
 
03:54:10.000 --> 03:54:11.670 align:start position:0%
that's getting close to a legal question
so

03:54:11.670 --> 03:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:54:13.670 --> 03:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
but um no um the way so the formula
 
03:54:15.510 --> 03:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
works there's constitutional adequacy
 
03:54:16.950 --> 03:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
and then there's other parts of that we
 
03:54:18.229 --> 03:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
call it adequacy but it's not part of
 
03:54:20.070 --> 03:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional adequacy constitutional
 
03:54:21.510 --> 03:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
adequacy that's being litigated at the
 
03:54:23.910 --> 03:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
moment is three thousand seven hundred
 
03:54:25.110 --> 03:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
and eighty six dollars and sixty six
 
03:54:27.510 --> 03:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
cents per kid uh one thousand nine
 
03:54:29.349 --> 03:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
hundred and something dollars for every
 
03:54:31.110 --> 03:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
f r student two thousand dollars for
 
03:54:32.550 --> 03:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
every sped student there's a building
 
03:54:34.150 --> 03:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
blocks of the formula that's
 
03:54:35.990 --> 03:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
part of constitutional adequacy and then
 
03:54:37.670 --> 03:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
there's parts of the formula that are
 
03:54:39.189 --> 03:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
additional funding above and beyond what
 
03:54:41.030 --> 03:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
we are constitutionally required to uh
 
03:54:42.790 --> 03:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
provide that includes stabilization
 
03:54:44.710 --> 03:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
grants that includes relief aid which
 
03:54:46.070 --> 03:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
was passed in the budget and that would
 
03:54:47.510 --> 03:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
also include this grant this is above
 
03:54:48.550 --> 03:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
and beyond
 
03:54:49.750 --> 03:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
what the state has defined as a
 
03:54:52.469 --> 03:54:52.479 align:start position:0%
constitutional adequacy
 
03:54:55.510 --> 03:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
but how it impacts the courts um
 
03:54:58.309 --> 03:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
most likely the courts are
 
03:55:00.150 --> 03:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
i would expect them to litigate the
 
03:55:02.070 --> 03:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional side of the formula not
 
03:55:04.710 --> 03:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
this side of the formula but um you know
 
03:55:05.590 --> 03:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
the courts are going to do what they're
 
03:55:13.590 --> 03:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:16.150 --> 03:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
representative thank you uh just so i
 
03:55:19.189 --> 03:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
make sure i heard you right so
 
03:55:21.830 --> 03:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
this is above and beyond any
 
03:55:25.990 --> 03:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional adequacy and any other
 
03:55:27.990 --> 03:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
adequacies that are out there yeah this
 
03:55:31.189 --> 03:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
is the um uh this is funding
 
03:55:37.349 --> 03:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:41.830 --> 03:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
yeah uh it it it oftentimes becomes very
 
03:55:41.840 --> 03:55:43.830 align:start position:0%
yeah uh it it it oftentimes becomes very
confusing

03:55:43.830 --> 03:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
03:55:43.840 --> 03:55:46.389 align:start position:0%
confusing
and

03:55:46.389 --> 03:55:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:48.309 --> 03:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
even though
 
03:55:50.309 --> 03:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
some of us have been on division two for
 
03:55:51.590 --> 03:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
a long time
 
03:55:57.030 --> 03:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
we still learn things every single year
 
03:55:57.040 --> 03:55:59.030 align:start position:0%
we still learn things every single year
so

03:55:59.030 --> 03:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:55:59.040 --> 03:56:00.070 align:start position:0%
so
okay

03:56:00.070 --> 03:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:56:04.229 --> 03:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:06.790 --> 03:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh if we're are we ready for a motion oh
 
03:56:06.800 --> 03:56:07.510 align:start position:0%
uh if we're are we ready for a motion oh
no

03:56:07.510 --> 03:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:56:08.710 --> 03:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
i think mickey
 
03:56:10.150 --> 03:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
sorry did mickey provide a handout this
 
03:56:11.349 --> 03:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
handout yes
 
03:56:11.359 --> 03:56:12.229 align:start position:0%
handout yes
yes

03:56:12.229 --> 03:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:56:13.510 --> 03:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
so i just wanna we've i think we've
 
03:56:15.429 --> 03:56:15.439 align:start position:0%
covered a lot um and
 
03:56:16.870 --> 03:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
i think the bill has amended if my
 
03:56:19.510 --> 03:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is correct um
 
03:56:21.670 --> 03:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
did you just suspect differential aid is
 
03:56:24.150 --> 03:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
out um or i don't know if you accepted
 
03:56:26.389 --> 03:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
that amendment or not um
 
03:56:27.510 --> 03:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
the one thing i want to talk about is
 
03:56:29.269 --> 03:56:29.279 align:start position:0%
the accountability plan that the house
 
03:56:29.279 --> 03:56:30.229 align:start position:0%
the accountability plan that the house
added

03:56:30.229 --> 03:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
added
 
03:56:30.239 --> 03:56:31.269 align:start position:0%
added
so

03:56:31.269 --> 03:56:31.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:56:32.790 --> 03:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:56:35.189 --> 03:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
as uh as uh the senate passed it just an
 
03:56:36.550 --> 03:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs grant the house
 
03:56:38.870 --> 03:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
recently added
 
03:56:40.630 --> 03:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
to receive that extraordinary needs
 
03:56:42.550 --> 03:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
grant it's contingent upon
 
03:56:44.710 --> 03:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
completing an accountability plan so i
 
03:56:45.910 --> 03:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
just want to in the handout in the
 
03:56:47.429 --> 03:56:47.439 align:start position:0%
middle section there i talk a little bit
 
03:56:50.550 --> 03:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
about what that could possibly cost
 
03:56:52.950 --> 03:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
for districts so in that middle section
 
03:56:54.469 --> 03:56:54.479 align:start position:0%
there the accountability plan relative
 
03:56:56.550 --> 03:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
to extraordinary needs grant um so the
 
03:56:59.429 --> 03:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
first um looking at the data it looks
 
03:57:02.309 --> 03:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
like about 80 85 school districts would
 
03:57:03.830 --> 03:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
have to complete one of these plans in
 
03:57:05.510 --> 03:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
order to receive an extraordinary needs
 
03:57:05.520 --> 03:57:07.030 align:start position:0%
order to receive an extraordinary needs
grant

03:57:07.030 --> 03:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
grant
 
03:57:08.229 --> 03:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
and if they didn't complete one
 
03:57:09.830 --> 03:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
according to the way the legislation's
 
03:57:11.670 --> 03:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
written we would have to not give them
 
03:57:14.389 --> 03:57:14.399 align:start position:0%
one of these grants
 
03:57:16.070 --> 03:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
making the grant contingent upon
 
03:57:17.510 --> 03:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
completing one of these accountability
 
03:57:19.269 --> 03:57:19.279 align:start position:0%
plans could create some
 
03:57:21.750 --> 03:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
administrative fiscal technical issues
 
03:57:23.510 --> 03:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
it could create
 
03:57:27.590 --> 03:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
people that don't want to be accountable
 
03:57:29.750 --> 03:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
okay it could also do that um so the
 
03:57:30.870 --> 03:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
likely the way that just so you're
 
03:57:31.990 --> 03:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
understanding how the department would
 
03:57:33.349 --> 03:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
implement this
 
03:57:36.870 --> 03:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
we would likely include the grant
 
03:57:39.030 --> 03:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
as your state revenue during the tax
 
03:57:40.469 --> 03:57:40.479 align:start position:0%
setting process
 
03:57:42.710 --> 03:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
and then if they did not complete it we
 
03:57:45.269 --> 03:57:45.279 align:start position:0%
would dock their adequacy by that amount
 
03:57:47.750 --> 03:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
to end the school year and so for a lot
 
03:57:51.110 --> 03:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:53.349 --> 03:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
that much of a
 
03:57:54.710 --> 03:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
dock because some of them are receiving
 
03:57:56.630 --> 03:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
really small grants but for some
 
03:57:58.630 --> 03:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
districts we would dock their adequacy
 
03:58:00.150 --> 03:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
and then that could create
 
03:58:01.910 --> 03:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
a potential budget hole if we took that
 
03:58:03.830 --> 03:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
adequacy away if they did not complete
 
03:58:05.670 --> 03:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
this accountability plan so i'm just
 
03:58:07.670 --> 03:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
making the committee aware of that
 
03:58:07.680 --> 03:58:09.349 align:start position:0%
making the committee aware of that
um

03:58:09.349 --> 03:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:09.359 --> 03:58:11.030 align:start position:0%
um
lastly

03:58:11.030 --> 03:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
lastly
 
03:58:13.750 --> 03:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
these accountability plans uh uh
 
03:58:13.760 --> 03:58:14.790 align:start position:0%
these accountability plans uh uh
they

03:58:14.790 --> 03:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:58:16.229 --> 03:58:16.239 align:start position:0%
using the model of the federal
 
03:58:18.070 --> 03:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
accountability laws how much these
 
03:58:21.030 --> 03:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
typically cost we have a con
 
03:58:23.429 --> 03:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
we have a contractor who charges 37 000
 
03:58:25.030 --> 03:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
to develop one of these accountability
 
03:58:26.070 --> 03:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
plans or something like this
 
03:58:27.590 --> 03:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
accountability plan
 
03:58:31.990 --> 03:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
so 37 to 37 200 develop a new plan
 
03:58:32.000 --> 03:58:33.110 align:start position:0%
so 37 to 37 200 develop a new plan
28

03:58:33.110 --> 03:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
28
 
03:58:36.550 --> 03:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
800 to revise your plan um so to do a
 
03:58:38.870 --> 03:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
quality accountability plan it does cost
 
03:58:40.790 --> 03:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
money this is an example of using a
 
03:58:40.800 --> 03:58:42.070 align:start position:0%
money this is an example of using a
contractor

03:58:42.070 --> 03:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
03:58:44.710 --> 03:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
and so if just to talk about the cost of
 
03:58:46.990 --> 03:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
of developing that plan if we do the
 
03:58:50.469 --> 03:58:50.479 align:start position:0%
37.2 k multiplied by the 85 districts
 
03:58:53.110 --> 03:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
this could be 10 potentially a 3 million
 
03:58:55.189 --> 03:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
dollar 3.1 million dollar cost to school
 
03:58:57.429 --> 03:58:57.439 align:start position:0%
districts i don't think
 
03:59:00.469 --> 03:59:00.479 align:start position:0%
that we need to have something this
 
03:59:00.479 --> 03:59:02.469 align:start position:0%
that we need to have something this
complicated

03:59:02.469 --> 03:59:02.479 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
03:59:02.479 --> 03:59:04.309 align:start position:0%
complicated
okay

03:59:04.309 --> 03:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:59:05.429 --> 03:59:05.439 align:start position:0%
my goal
 
03:59:05.439 --> 03:59:06.229 align:start position:0%
my goal
and

03:59:06.229 --> 03:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:08.630 --> 03:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
senator hennessey's goal
 
03:59:09.910 --> 03:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
is to say
 
03:59:12.870 --> 03:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
i am giving you manchester over three
 
03:59:14.950 --> 03:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars to help your free and
 
03:59:18.790 --> 03:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch kids what are you doing
 
03:59:21.030 --> 03:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
for that a
 
03:59:23.670 --> 03:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
i've hired a new teacher that will teach
 
03:59:27.269 --> 03:59:27.279 align:start position:0%
reading from eight to twelve every day
 
03:59:30.229 --> 03:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
and we'll teach math from
 
03:59:33.030 --> 03:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
one to two or whatever the time frame is
 
03:59:38.389 --> 03:59:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:41.590 --> 03:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
right right you know i don't think any
 
03:59:43.110 --> 03:59:43.120 align:start position:0%
of us are
 
03:59:46.309 --> 03:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
looking for anything much more detailed
 
03:59:47.429 --> 03:59:47.439 align:start position:0%
than that
 
03:59:49.670 --> 03:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not looking for
 
03:59:51.349 --> 03:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
you know a plan to build a new high
 
03:59:51.359 --> 03:59:52.790 align:start position:0%
you know a plan to build a new high
school

03:59:52.790 --> 03:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:59:56.389 --> 03:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
i'm just simply want them to tell me
 
03:59:58.070 --> 03:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
what they are doing
 
03:59:58.080 --> 03:59:59.990 align:start position:0%
what they are doing
and

03:59:59.990 --> 04:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:00:03.750 --> 04:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
and what they expect the results to be
 
04:00:06.309 --> 04:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
okay if i am concentrating on the free
 
04:00:08.469 --> 04:00:08.479 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch then
 
04:00:11.510 --> 04:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
to me if i measured it at the end of the
 
04:00:13.349 --> 04:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
school year
 
04:00:16.389 --> 04:00:16.399 align:start position:0%
in the early school year everybody's
 
04:00:19.269 --> 04:00:19.279 align:start position:0%
one one and a half grades below
 
04:00:22.070 --> 04:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
reading at the end of the school year
 
04:00:23.910 --> 04:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
they're at
 
04:00:26.469 --> 04:00:26.479 align:start position:0%
one grade below i mean it's something as
 
04:00:30.309 --> 04:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
almost as simple as that so don't create
 
04:00:33.110 --> 04:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
a three million dollar
 
04:00:33.120 --> 04:00:35.189 align:start position:0%
a three million dollar
program

04:00:35.189 --> 04:00:35.199 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:00:37.830 --> 04:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
just to solve something
 
04:00:40.070 --> 04:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
that can be done
 
04:00:40.080 --> 04:00:41.830 align:start position:0%
that can be done
almost

04:00:41.830 --> 04:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
almost
 
04:00:45.750 --> 04:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
right here in in this room
 
04:00:47.670 --> 04:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
04:00:49.830 --> 04:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
districts must be pretty used to doing
 
04:00:51.990 --> 04:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
this anyway every year they have to do
 
04:00:54.469 --> 04:00:54.479 align:start position:0%
the title one application for funding
 
04:00:56.710 --> 04:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
and there are goals and objectives and
 
04:00:59.910 --> 04:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
and targets learning targets so this
 
04:01:02.469 --> 04:01:02.479 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be i agree with um
 
04:01:05.030 --> 04:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
the chair that this should be something
 
04:01:07.990 --> 04:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
fairly simple my question is do you
 
04:01:09.349 --> 04:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
would this plan
 
04:01:09.359 --> 04:01:10.870 align:start position:0%
would this plan
only

04:01:10.870 --> 04:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
only
 
04:01:14.469 --> 04:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
uh be attributed to those dollars that
 
04:01:16.790 --> 04:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
are being used for this purpose
 
04:01:23.429 --> 04:01:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:28.710 --> 04:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
if you if you look at the fiscal note
 
04:01:32.950 --> 04:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:35.670 --> 04:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
i'll just look at the last page it says
 
04:01:38.070 --> 04:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
woodstock gets 8
 
04:01:38.080 --> 04:01:40.630 align:start position:0%
woodstock gets 8
870

04:01:40.630 --> 04:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
870
 
04:01:44.550 --> 04:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
you know they don't need to spend 37 to
 
04:01:47.670 --> 04:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
figure out how they're going to do that
 
04:01:50.229 --> 04:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
represent maria
 
04:01:52.469 --> 04:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
thank you so can you clarify did you put
 
04:01:54.070 --> 04:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
this together you said that
 
04:01:56.389 --> 04:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
that it was accountability was added
 
04:02:00.309 --> 04:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
into this but were there there aren't um
 
04:02:02.710 --> 04:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
proposals in that language as to how to
 
04:02:05.189 --> 04:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
do this this is your proposal about how
 
04:02:07.189 --> 04:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
they might do it is that i don't know
 
04:02:09.910 --> 04:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
where how this fits in with the house
 
04:02:11.910 --> 04:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
asking for accountability so we
 
04:02:14.469 --> 04:02:14.479 align:start position:0%
currently have a federal law in essa
 
04:02:16.630 --> 04:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
the average student succeeds act
 
04:02:18.710 --> 04:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
that defines how accountability works
 
04:02:20.229 --> 04:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
and it's for
 
04:02:21.830 --> 04:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
these schools called comprehensive
 
04:02:23.910 --> 04:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
support and improvement schools so a
 
04:02:25.750 --> 04:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
district like manchester has some csi
 
04:02:27.269 --> 04:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
schools so they're very used of going
 
04:02:28.550 --> 04:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
through this exercise
 
04:02:30.630 --> 04:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh but that's we have very few csi
 
04:02:32.309 --> 04:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
schools at schools that are have um are
 
04:02:34.309 --> 04:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
in the bottom five percent i believe um
 
04:02:37.030 --> 04:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
in perform testing so manchester has
 
04:02:39.110 --> 04:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
some ex
 
04:02:40.950 --> 04:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
experience going through that process
 
04:02:43.590 --> 04:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
but what the way we contract out so we
 
04:02:45.429 --> 04:02:45.439 align:start position:0%
can use federal money to pay so
 
04:02:46.550 --> 04:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
manchester doesn't have to pay for that
 
04:02:48.469 --> 04:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
plan and do accountability by themselves
 
04:02:50.870 --> 04:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
they can access
 
04:02:52.710 --> 04:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
our state contract we have and the state
 
04:02:55.269 --> 04:02:55.279 align:start position:0%
contract is itemized in the same the way
 
04:02:56.389 --> 04:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
the table is so we're just mirroring
 
04:02:58.950 --> 04:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
this off the way the federal law works
 
04:03:00.550 --> 04:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
so if woodstock is getting eight
 
04:03:02.229 --> 04:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
04:03:05.269 --> 04:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
you're asking them to pay 37 000 in
 
04:03:06.870 --> 04:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
order to get that this is where i'm kind
 
04:03:09.189 --> 04:03:09.199 align:start position:0%
of i'm losing it and that's so in order
 
04:03:11.670 --> 04:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
to do a quality accountability plan it
 
04:03:12.710 --> 04:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
would cost
 
04:03:14.630 --> 04:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
likely more than eight thousand dollars
 
04:03:14.640 --> 04:03:16.150 align:start position:0%
likely more than eight thousand dollars
but

04:03:16.150 --> 04:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:03:17.670 --> 04:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
can they just send a letter to
 
04:03:19.910 --> 04:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative umberger if if that's
 
04:03:21.189 --> 04:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
sufficient for accountability the
 
04:03:21.199 --> 04:03:22.389 align:start position:0%
sufficient for accountability the
department

04:03:22.389 --> 04:03:22.399 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:03:24.950 --> 04:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
would prefer that accountability is
 
04:03:26.870 --> 04:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
is done with using data and bringing in
 
04:03:28.790 --> 04:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
stakeholders we would we would prefer
 
04:03:31.189 --> 04:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
that it be paid for by the department
 
04:03:34.950 --> 04:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
with ezra funds okay yes that's what we
 
04:03:37.429 --> 04:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
that's what we would prefer rather than
 
04:03:40.150 --> 04:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
having every school district come in and
 
04:03:43.269 --> 04:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
apply for esra funds if that's the kind
 
04:03:46.630 --> 04:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
of detail that you want
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's the kind of detail
 
04:03:52.790 --> 04:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
that we were looking for but
 
04:03:55.189 --> 04:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
okay i don't know if we'd be able to use
 
04:03:57.590 --> 04:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
esser funds for for a state program like
 
04:03:58.550 --> 04:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
this but
 
04:03:59.910 --> 04:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
you never know
 
04:04:02.229 --> 04:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
do you try
 
04:04:02.239 --> 04:04:03.349 align:start position:0%
do you try
uh

04:04:03.349 --> 04:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:04:04.830 --> 04:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
representative did you have another
 
04:04:07.189 --> 04:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
question along the same lines i just
 
04:04:08.630 --> 04:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
looked at that first page of the
 
04:04:10.070 --> 04:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
distribution and
 
04:04:12.710 --> 04:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
16 out of the 28 towns there have would
 
04:04:15.750 --> 04:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
receive less money than the cost of
 
04:04:17.990 --> 04:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
doing an accountability plan that's 16
 
04:04:21.030 --> 04:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
out of 28. uh the other issue
 
04:04:22.950 --> 04:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
so that's just a comment the other issue
 
04:04:22.960 --> 04:04:23.990 align:start position:0%
so that's just a comment the other issue
is

04:04:23.990 --> 04:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:04:24.000 --> 04:04:26.630 align:start position:0%
is
um

04:04:26.630 --> 04:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:29.429 --> 04:04:29.439 align:start position:0%
i just picked a random number of 300 000
 
04:04:31.510 --> 04:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
there's only 10 towns in the entire
 
04:04:33.510 --> 04:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
state that are going to receive really
 
04:04:35.830 --> 04:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
the lion's share of
 
04:04:38.150 --> 04:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
this uh money and maybe that's the
 
04:04:39.510 --> 04:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
intent but i
 
04:04:40.790 --> 04:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
i can't
 
04:04:46.469 --> 04:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:51.510 --> 04:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:54.150 --> 04:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
you look at that and uh
 
04:04:57.269 --> 04:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
berlin is at 377
 
04:04:57.279 --> 04:04:59.189 align:start position:0%
berlin is at 377
and

04:04:59.189 --> 04:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:05:02.790 --> 04:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
they're poorer than a church mouse okay
 
04:05:02.800 --> 04:05:03.510 align:start position:0%
they're poorer than a church mouse okay
in

04:05:03.510 --> 04:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:05:05.349 --> 04:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
in the community
 
04:05:06.790 --> 04:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
and then they're talking about closing
 
04:05:08.870 --> 04:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
the biomass plant so
 
04:05:11.750 --> 04:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
let's throw something else ugly at them
 
04:05:11.760 --> 04:05:12.710 align:start position:0%
let's throw something else ugly at them
okay

04:05:12.710 --> 04:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:05:12.720 --> 04:05:15.349 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:05:15.349 --> 04:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:18.950 --> 04:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:21.030 --> 04:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
oh farmington
 
04:05:27.910 --> 04:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:31.269 --> 04:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
yeah we we just eliminated that
 
04:05:34.309 --> 04:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
that's in the fiscal note that's 24. oh
 
04:05:37.670 --> 04:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:40.229 --> 04:05:40.239 align:start position:0%
yeah 20
 
04:05:45.429 --> 04:05:45.439 align:start position:0%
yeah 23. yeah this is 24. 23 and then
 
04:05:47.670 --> 04:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
14.7 million for 20
 
04:05:50.950 --> 04:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
for 23 and then a drop in aid for 24.
 
04:05:55.110 --> 04:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
and then we'll have to budget for it in
 
04:06:01.110 --> 04:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:03.349 --> 04:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
04:06:03.359 --> 04:06:05.510 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
yes

04:06:05.510 --> 04:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:06:07.189 --> 04:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
so i'm still stuck on accountability
 
04:06:10.630 --> 04:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
what are we asking them to do
 
04:06:12.389 --> 04:06:12.399 align:start position:0%
we're just asking for
 
04:06:13.429 --> 04:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:06:16.150 --> 04:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
obviously all of these schools get idea
 
04:06:16.160 --> 04:06:17.189 align:start position:0%
obviously all of these schools get idea
money

04:06:17.189 --> 04:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:06:20.070 --> 04:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
where they have to be accountable
 
04:06:20.080 --> 04:06:20.950 align:start position:0%
where they have to be accountable
okay

04:06:20.950 --> 04:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:06:21.910 --> 04:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:06:23.110 --> 04:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
to me
 
04:06:24.710 --> 04:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
this would be
 
04:06:26.950 --> 04:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
you know i've got this underlying ida
 
04:06:26.960 --> 04:06:28.309 align:start position:0%
you know i've got this underlying ida
money

04:06:28.309 --> 04:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:06:28.319 --> 04:06:30.070 align:start position:0%
money
for

04:06:30.070 --> 04:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:06:31.910 --> 04:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
school a b and c
 
04:06:33.910 --> 04:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
and with this additional money this is
 
04:06:36.150 --> 04:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
what i'll be able to accomplish
 
04:06:40.229 --> 04:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
i don't you know i don't think we need
 
04:06:42.150 --> 04:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
much more than that so it's not what's
 
04:06:44.630 --> 04:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
proposed here there's nothing proposed
 
04:06:46.389 --> 04:06:46.399 align:start position:0%
about this
 
04:06:49.189 --> 04:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
we're not doing that no
 
04:06:51.750 --> 04:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
the the front lines
 
04:06:54.630 --> 04:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
that's this yeah and that's not what's
 
04:06:55.830 --> 04:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
going to have to happen for these
 
04:06:57.830 --> 04:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
schools to get their funding i don't
 
04:06:59.349 --> 04:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
think so
 
04:07:02.309 --> 04:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
there's requirements on line 17 to 29 it
 
04:07:04.150 --> 04:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
goes into detail what metrics they must
 
04:07:04.160 --> 04:07:05.349 align:start position:0%
goes into detail what metrics they must
analyze

04:07:05.349 --> 04:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
analyze
 
04:07:06.950 --> 04:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
so they have to do that complete that
 
04:07:08.070 --> 04:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
work and demonstrate that they've
 
04:07:09.349 --> 04:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
completed that work
 
04:07:15.189 --> 04:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:17.189 --> 04:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
on page
 
04:07:19.110 --> 04:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
sorry the first uh so you got the first
 
04:07:20.309 --> 04:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
title page then you go to the second
 
04:07:21.830 --> 04:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
page yeah
 
04:07:24.630 --> 04:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
so still on section one pages uh lines
 
04:07:26.469 --> 04:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
17 through
 
04:07:28.870 --> 04:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
29 and continuing and describes exactly
 
04:07:31.429 --> 04:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
what the plan uh accountability process
 
04:07:32.309 --> 04:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
should be
 
04:07:34.469 --> 04:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
analyzing mathematics grades three
 
04:07:36.870 --> 04:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
through eight um
 
04:07:42.309 --> 04:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:46.389 --> 04:07:46.399 align:start position:0%
are you on 420 420 yeah first page first
 
04:07:50.229 --> 04:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
page oh not the first
 
04:07:52.149 --> 04:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
line 17
 
04:07:54.950 --> 04:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:56.710 --> 04:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
so they can do their accountability plan
 
04:07:58.070 --> 04:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
that will
 
04:08:00.309 --> 04:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
be satisfactory but they don't have to
 
04:08:01.910 --> 04:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
go through necessarily what you're
 
04:08:03.189 --> 04:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
proposing they don't necessarily have to
 
04:08:04.710 --> 04:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
hire a contractor but they do have to do
 
04:08:06.469 --> 04:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
that work and so they don't have to hire
 
04:08:07.910 --> 04:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
the contractor yes that's what i need to
 
04:08:10.469 --> 04:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
see here but they're they're really
 
04:08:12.870 --> 04:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
doing this work anyhow for idea yeah
 
04:08:12.880 --> 04:08:14.790 align:start position:0%
doing this work anyhow for idea yeah
okay

04:08:14.790 --> 04:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:08:16.389 --> 04:08:16.399 align:start position:0%
and for esr
 
04:08:18.469 --> 04:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
but they have to do this work specific
 
04:08:20.309 --> 04:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
to the funding they're receiving for the
 
04:08:21.910 --> 04:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
state funding right
 
04:08:23.590 --> 04:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
this ground
 
04:08:24.630 --> 04:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
04:08:26.710 --> 04:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
but you need to are you you are
 
04:08:28.710 --> 04:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
proposing that
 
04:08:30.309 --> 04:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
04:08:31.910 --> 04:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
work with the department of ed to
 
04:08:34.229 --> 04:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
contract with these contractors to do
 
04:08:35.189 --> 04:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
the work
 
04:08:37.110 --> 04:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
we're using the contract as an example
 
04:08:39.429 --> 04:08:39.439 align:start position:0%
to show how much it costs um only as an
 
04:08:40.710 --> 04:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
example as an example of how much it
 
04:08:41.990 --> 04:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
costs and that could be potentially
 
04:08:43.510 --> 04:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
available to districts so in a place
 
04:08:45.429 --> 04:08:45.439 align:start position:0%
like manchester where they have a grants
 
04:08:47.750 --> 04:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
writer and evaluation person that person
 
04:08:49.110 --> 04:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
would probably
 
04:08:51.950 --> 04:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
and you said that it was only
 
04:08:54.950 --> 04:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
specific to those dollars that they're
 
04:08:58.309 --> 04:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
going to use coming out of this
 
04:08:59.990 --> 04:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
if you have an accountability plan on
 
04:09:02.710 --> 04:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
federal dollars it's it's focused on the
 
04:09:04.149 --> 04:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
use of those federal dollars and how
 
04:09:05.670 --> 04:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
you've improved your school with those
 
04:09:06.710 --> 04:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
federal dollars so you have to mimic
 
04:09:08.550 --> 04:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
that same exact process but with the
 
04:09:10.710 --> 04:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs grant dollars so
 
04:09:12.389 --> 04:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
almost every school district in the
 
04:09:14.710 --> 04:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
state does that if they're eligible for
 
04:09:16.550 --> 04:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
esser funds
 
04:09:20.550 --> 04:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
or for the esa money so everybody should
 
04:09:23.750 --> 04:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:25.349 --> 04:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
yeah i can't i just can tell you how
 
04:09:27.110 --> 04:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
much it costs to have a contractor do
 
04:09:29.269 --> 04:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
that process i just i just want to make
 
04:09:30.630 --> 04:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not
 
04:09:30.640 --> 04:09:31.750 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not
imposing

04:09:31.750 --> 04:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
imposing
 
04:09:31.760 --> 04:09:33.349 align:start position:0%
imposing
another

04:09:33.349 --> 04:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
another
 
04:09:37.269 --> 04:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
big process on a school district
 
04:09:40.149 --> 04:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:43.269 --> 04:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
if we are i want someone to call me
 
04:09:49.030 --> 04:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:50.870 --> 04:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative lynn
 
04:09:52.790 --> 04:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
yes um uh
 
04:09:54.309 --> 04:09:54.319 align:start position:0%
represent my colleague from windham
 
04:09:57.269 --> 04:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
representative sony asked me
 
04:09:58.790 --> 04:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
about that i think it's a good question
 
04:10:00.630 --> 04:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
if we're going to be
 
04:10:02.469 --> 04:10:02.479 align:start position:0%
providing these
 
04:10:04.870 --> 04:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
grants to certain districts
 
04:10:06.229 --> 04:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
what about
 
04:10:09.269 --> 04:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
either charter schools or the new
 
04:10:11.510 --> 04:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
efas i mean do they
 
04:10:11.520 --> 04:10:13.670 align:start position:0%
efas i mean do they
uh

04:10:13.670 --> 04:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:10:15.830 --> 04:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
will they fit into this somehow and if
 
04:10:18.550 --> 04:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
not why not so this is based the metric
 
04:10:20.229 --> 04:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
here is it's for district public schools
 
04:10:21.990 --> 04:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
that would not um charter schools and
 
04:10:23.349 --> 04:10:23.359 align:start position:0%
efas would not
 
04:10:25.030 --> 04:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
get any of this funding
 
04:10:28.309 --> 04:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
it's based on property values over fnr
 
04:10:30.710 --> 04:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
students so it's it's kind of a meant to
 
04:10:30.720 --> 04:10:31.750 align:start position:0%
students so it's it's kind of a meant to
target

04:10:31.750 --> 04:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
target
 
04:10:33.750 --> 04:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
communities with less property wealth
 
04:10:35.269 --> 04:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
and that's because property taxes pay
 
04:10:36.950 --> 04:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
for district public schools and property
 
04:10:38.550 --> 04:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
taxes don't pay for charter schools so
 
04:10:41.510 --> 04:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
the intent is to focus on uh
 
04:10:44.550 --> 04:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
district schools who require who depend
 
04:10:46.630 --> 04:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
on property wealth to fund their schools
 
04:10:46.640 --> 04:10:47.910 align:start position:0%
on property wealth to fund their schools
well

04:10:47.910 --> 04:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:10:48.950 --> 04:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
i i
 
04:10:51.110 --> 04:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
i mean certainly i guess
 
04:10:52.550 --> 04:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm not clear on that i thought
 
04:10:54.070 --> 04:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
i thought that charter schools were
 
04:10:56.790 --> 04:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
public schools and they were funded by
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
at least in part by property tax they're
 
04:11:01.750 --> 04:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
not they're not funded by um
 
04:11:04.149 --> 04:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
they're funded by state etf dollars we
 
04:11:06.710 --> 04:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
we pay we the state
 
04:11:06.720 --> 04:11:07.590 align:start position:0%
we pay we the state
okay

04:11:07.590 --> 04:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:11:10.469 --> 04:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
pay for the charter school funding
 
04:11:14.070 --> 04:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
we the state pay for the ef
 
04:11:17.189 --> 04:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
a the dfa's okay yeah okay all right so
 
04:11:20.229 --> 04:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
i knew that was true for yesterday yeah
 
04:11:23.269 --> 04:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
there is no loca there aren't no local
 
04:11:27.030 --> 04:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
tax dollars that go to either of those
 
04:11:27.040 --> 04:11:29.030 align:start position:0%
tax dollars that go to either of those
entities

04:11:29.030 --> 04:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
entities
 
04:11:31.030 --> 04:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
right okay okay
 
04:11:32.469 --> 04:11:32.479 align:start position:0%
just to get a little into the weeds here
 
04:11:33.990 --> 04:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
if you're looking for a vehicle to fund
 
04:11:36.229 --> 04:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
charter schools or efas
 
04:11:37.590 --> 04:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
um you wouldn't want to use property
 
04:11:38.790 --> 04:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
values you just want to find another
 
04:11:40.309 --> 04:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle to fund them because this
 
04:11:41.590 --> 04:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
formula wouldn't work would it make
 
04:11:44.229 --> 04:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
sense for charters
 
04:11:50.550 --> 04:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:52.469 --> 04:11:52.479 align:start position:0%
represent petri
 
04:11:54.630 --> 04:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
i'm ready is everybody ready
 
04:11:54.640 --> 04:11:56.149 align:start position:0%
i'm ready is everybody ready
okay

04:11:56.149 --> 04:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:12:09.429 --> 04:12:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:09.439 --> 04:12:10.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:12:10.389 --> 04:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:12:13.269 --> 04:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
and we all know that uh there are two
 
04:12:13.279 --> 04:12:15.510 align:start position:0%
and we all know that uh there are two
amendments

04:12:15.510 --> 04:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
04:12:18.630 --> 04:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
to this bill i'll i'll merge those to be
 
04:12:20.149 --> 04:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
one amendment for the whole committee
 
04:12:22.070 --> 04:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so we'll have a new number once i
 
04:12:24.790 --> 04:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
get that i'll email it to everybody
 
04:12:27.590 --> 04:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
otpa with
 
04:12:31.189 --> 04:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
two amendments out of ours yeah okay and
 
04:12:31.199 --> 04:12:33.349 align:start position:0%
two amendments out of ours yeah okay and
then

04:12:33.349 --> 04:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
