00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
the pandemic remote meetings also allow
 
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
many more people to take part in their
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
government we've seen during public
 
00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:21.919 align:start position:0%
hearings this session that many more
 
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
people to remote hearings and would nor
 
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
normally be able to and this is not to
 
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:28.919 align:start position:0%
mention the many more elected officials
 
00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
who have an Avenue to participate
 
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
without worrying about child care as
 
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
much or needing to travel during this
 
00:08:37.709 --> 00:08:37.719 align:start position:0%
unusual time passing part one of sb95
 
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
will ensure that governments on all
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
levels City towns are able to continue
 
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
offering expanded access and
 
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
transparency even after the covid-19
 
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic and the state of emergency
 
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.550 align:start position:0%
pandemic and the state of emergency
end

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
end
 
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
um you know I'll be happy to answer any
 
00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
questions I do add that we've worked
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
closely with the New Hampshire Municipal
 
00:08:58.990 --> 00:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
Association on the language of this bill
 
00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:01.959 align:start position:0%
and that originally both Senator James
 
00:09:06.069 --> 00:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
and I had brought um separate parts of s
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
sp95 so there was originally a part one
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
and a part two we've worked together to
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
combine those two parts so that what the
 
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
bill that's in front of you now um
 
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
represents the combined efforts of the
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
Senate to find something that everybody
 
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
could work with and so um this bill
 
00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:26.839 align:start position:0%
passed on the senate floor 24 to nothing
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
um and I welcome your questions I know
 
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.870 align:start position:0%
um and I welcome your questions I know
that

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh cell Johnson from New Hampshire
 
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:40.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:43.630 align:start position:0%
 
senat

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
senat
 
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I'm looking
 
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
through the bill and it it scratches out
 
00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
all of the language you pertaining to
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
the requirements for having an emergency
 
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
and things of this nature are there any
 
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.190 align:start position:0%
and things of this nature are there any
um

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:06.279 align:start position:0%
requirements uh to allow this to take
 
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
place or is it just the body on its own
 
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
can just decide that this is the best
 
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
way to do its own
 
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
business uh yes sir thank you very much
 
00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:17.839 align:start position:0%
for the question representative it it
 
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
was um in the Senate part of compromise
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
that we made that it needs to be the
 
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
governing body of each municipality that
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
makes the decision whether to hold um
 
00:10:31.069 --> 00:10:31.079 align:start position:0%
remote meetings so the way that it's
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
structured now is that um remote
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
meetings can continue in their current
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
state until each municipality has the
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take that vote at which
 
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:45.240 align:start position:0%
time the authority has turned over to
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
them and in addition I think you'll see
 
00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:50.839 align:start position:0%
that we added um two things into this
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
legislation one is um a study commission
 
00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
which should meet later this year to
 
00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're correcting you know
 
00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:01.639 align:start position:0%
or improving the process in any way
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
possible and we added a sunset Clause so
 
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519 align:start position:0%
that um you know we need to make sure we
 
00:11:09.629 --> 00:11:09.639 align:start position:0%
have legislation on this next year that
 
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
will either extend the for
 
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities to do this if if a lot of
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
them take it up or where this right will
 
00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:18.519 align:start position:0%
end um after the legislative session
 
00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:21.550 align:start position:0%
end um after the legislative session
next

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:26.629 --> 00:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
sen yes represent
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much Mr chair first
 
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
of all I just say we got email from um
 
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
Senator daniels's Aid so he's trying to
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
log in so um might want to somebody
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
might want to call Deb Marton mik my
 
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
question is is um are there any um
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
requirements here for uh recording the
 
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
meetings when it's possible which uh
 
00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
something that was not done here in the
 
00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
house or the that was not done here in
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
the house house at all until like uh you
 
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:03.160 align:start position:0%
know until till 2020 but which is proven
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
very useful and is there any uh anything
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
in here talking about how the uh
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
recording should be uh
 
00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
preserved yes thank you representative
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
Horan um there is no requirement that uh
 
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.240 align:start position:0%
meetings be recorded there is only um
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
the requirement that if the meeting is
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
to be held remotely that there is audio
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
access available remotely there is
 
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
always the option of course that a
 
00:12:35.189 --> 00:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
municipality could choose to record but
 
00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um you know we just didn't
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
feel that that was um that that was
 
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
something that the all municipalities
 
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
would be able to to meet at this time
 
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:47.710 align:start position:0%
would be able to to meet at this time
okay

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
you guess my my only question that I had
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
when I read the bill
 
00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:00.519 align:start position:0%
was the first the first part then the
 
00:13:00.519 --> 00:13:01.350 align:start position:0%
was the first the first part then the
third

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
third
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
part again is establishing committee to
 
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
look at having the remote
 
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
meetings seems like it's sort of like a
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
a ready fire a approach by doing the
 
00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:22.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
afterwards yes thank you chairman Garden
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
so um and and I'm to how it it may come
 
00:13:34.509 --> 00:13:34.519 align:start position:0%
across a little confusing so the intent
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
is that because our municipalities are
 
00:13:40.509 --> 00:13:40.519 align:start position:0%
currently operating this way you know to
 
00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:42.519 align:start position:0%
the extent they have decided to or been
 
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
able to our hope is not to disturb their
 
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
business but rather let them continue in
 
00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
the way they've operating or chosen to
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
operate for this time however we also
 
00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that if there are
 
00:13:56.829 --> 00:13:56.839 align:start position:0%
opportunities to improve the procedure
 
00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
that's been underway for for example um
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
there was a conversation about whether
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
roll call votes are necessary for every
 
00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
vote over Zoom people had different
 
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
opinions about that that would be
 
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
something that could be raised in the
 
00:14:12.749 --> 00:14:12.759 align:start position:0%
study commission to ensure that um if we
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
are going to continue with remote
 
00:14:15.749 --> 00:14:15.759 align:start position:0%
meetings into next year and Beyond in
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
any capacity that we're doing so in the
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
best way possible so the idea was to
 
00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959 align:start position:0%
sort of you know
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
concurrently allow current operations to
 
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
continue while you know taking a look at
 
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
how we can improve that and then make
 
00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
sure that we we bring um the results of
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
both of those things back to the
 
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
legislature next year if we'd like to
 
00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519 align:start position:0%
remove the sunset or if we'd like to
 
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
statute thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
for my followup question I just you
 
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned in your testimony that there's
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
a sunset clause on this that the purpose
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
of the study committee is to look at it
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
um is that is is a sunset clause in part
 
00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
three of the of the bill I'm just trying
 
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:07.190 align:start position:0%
it yes exactly so
 
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:12.430 align:start position:0%

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm just looking at everything so in
 
00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
section in part
 
00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.590 align:start position:0%

Farmington um my part of this uh bill is
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
part two um violations of privacy um the
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
uh this was brought to me by both the
 
00:16:58.590 --> 00:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
chiefs of police in summersworth and r
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
Chester and the County Attorney uh that
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
currently under the statute for
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
violations of privacy where uh pictures
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
and other things are being taken of
 
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
people in violation of their privacy uh
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
is not allowed to be charged any higher
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
than a misdemeanor and they would like
 
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.350 align:start position:0%
than a misdemeanor and they would like
the

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity um if this is an ongoing
 
00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:25.959 align:start position:0%
thing with a particular individual to
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
increase that penalty and that's
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is that if they
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
believe that it is warranted it can be
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
gr question um thank you Mr chair um
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Senator
 
00:17:59.710 --> 00:17:59.720 align:start position:0%
gray now how do um these violations of
 
00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:03.559 align:start position:0%
privacy where there's a um kind of like
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
sexual um violation how do those work
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
with the sex offenders registry are
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
people who have found guilty of invading
 
00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
privacy um set at tier one tier two or
 
00:18:21.549 --> 00:18:21.559 align:start position:0%
tier three thank you um that would be a
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
decision for the courts uh I do not know
 
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
the the exact answer to that um again I
 
00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:29.919 align:start position:0%
don't think that if you're convicted of
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor anything happens but um I
 
00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:36.039 align:start position:0%
certainly am not the authority on that
 
00:18:36.039 --> 00:18:48.750 align:start position:0%
certainly am not the authority on that
thank

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
meeting you're not connected
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
yet that's correct he's not connected at
 
00:19:10.679 --> 00:19:13.669 align:start position:0%
yet that's correct he's not connected at
the

00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%

from antrum I'm speaking in support of
 
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
sb95 the pandemic pandemic has shown a
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
light on inequities and oversights in
 
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
our communities but it has also
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
illuminated new ways of working and
 
00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
participating in society video
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
conferencing tools such as Zoom
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
exemplify one of these changes
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
in our personal professional and Civic
 
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
lives we have quickly become accustomed
 
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
to communicating and interacting with
 
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
others while staying at
 
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
home citizen participation in
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
legislative hearings has been open to a
 
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
much wider population people who are
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
elderly disabled or health impaired can
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
now observe and testify on bills
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
important to them transportation to
 
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
conquered or time limitations no longer
 
00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
have to be impediments to
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
participation I support the creation of
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
a legislative committee to study remote
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
access to meetings and make re
 
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations My Hope Is that the
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
committee will recommend the
 
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
continuation of this access New
 
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Prides itself on having a
 
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
citizen legislature with significant
 
00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
input from
 
00:21:54.269 --> 00:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
constituents continuation of remote
 
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
access to legislative hearings will move
 
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
participation into the 21st century by
 
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%

is Todd selig I'm the administrator for
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
the town of Durham New Hampshire and I'm
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
accompanied this morning by with Wayne
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
Burton who is the uh Town Council Vice
 
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
chairman here in Durham um I believe
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
last evening representative Margie Smith
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
shared with you uh the Durham Town
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
Council resolution
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
20219 which was passed unanimously by a
 
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
90 vote last night endorsing
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
sb95 just a few thoughts for you on this
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
bill uh first at the outset of the
 
00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:15.559 align:start position:0%
pandemic we were very concerned about
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
how virtual meetings would work uh we
 
00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
put a lot of time and effort and
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
investment into that and ultimately
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
they've worked well Durham has a very
 
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
long tradition of equity and inclusion
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
and transparency so we wanted to give
 
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
our residents the fullest access to our
 
00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
public meetings and local officials
 
00:23:39.269 --> 00:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
during this pandemic time over time our
 
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
residents have become very familiar with
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
the platform um in fact we had a
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
resident last night at our council
 
00:23:46.269 --> 00:23:46.279 align:start position:0%
meeting who at the outset of the
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic struggled greatly to figure out
 
00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:50.919 align:start position:0%
how to unmute how to talk into the
 
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
microphone where to look last night this
 
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
individual was right there in the
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
meeting participating actively and this
 
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
was an individual who was old older in
 
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
years so it was very successful some uh
 
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
General benefits uh that I wanted to
 
00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
highlight for you first is um we believe
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
that residents gain better access to
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
public meetings with this virtual option
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
the second is um virtual meetings are
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
just plain more sustainable there's no
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
need to get in the car and drive to the
 
00:24:18.269 --> 00:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
town hall or in your case drive to
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
conquer you can participate virtually
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
which is positive third item is that um
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
it increases participation residents who
 
00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
have disabilities illnesses child care
 
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
or Elder Care issues or residents or

board members who are traveling can
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
participate virtually which has been
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
very beneficial the fourth point is uh
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
inclement weather no problem uh with
 
00:24:42.669 --> 00:24:42.679 align:start position:0%
zoom you can zoom into the meeting and
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
there's no need to to Brave the elements
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
and take a risk on icy roads in the
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
winter or if there's a a severe storm
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
that comes through and finally uram
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
we've had no issues of fraud or abuse
 
00:24:56.389 --> 00:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
locally it's worked very well so I just
 
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to close by saying that that you
 
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840 align:start position:0%

merged part one and part two which both
 
00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
had to do with virtual
 
00:26:48.909 --> 00:26:48.919 align:start position:0%
meetings uh and we use part two as the
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
base uh for bringing that forward uh the
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
bill authorizes the public body to allow
 
00:26:58.029 --> 00:26:58.039 align:start position:0%

not possess those means uh if the
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
meeting is virtual public notice must be
 
00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:29.960 align:start position:0%

public is unable to access the meeting
 
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
the meeting shall be adjourned so you
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
see it it's very much like what we are
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
doing now what we've been living with
 
00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
for the past few months uh just to
 
00:28:18.509 --> 00:28:18.519 align:start position:0%
quickly go
 
00:28:21.789 --> 00:28:21.799 align:start position:0%
through the bill uh because it was
 
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
amended in the
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
Senate uh so that the bill will take
 
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
effect upon passage uh regardless of
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
whether or not the state of emergency
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
exist and the continuation of virtual
 
00:28:36.909 --> 00:28:36.919 align:start position:0%
meeting Authority uh will continue until
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
July 1st
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
2022 um a study committee is
 
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
established uh which will be effective
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
60 days after passage to assess the
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
virtual meeting policy uh enacted to
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
monitor the practices and note any
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
problems that are encountered that study
 
00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
committee that study committee will rep
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
will re produce a report on November 1st
 
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
2021 and then be discontinued uh based
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
on the study committee's report and
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh we can then bring
 
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
forth legislation next year that will
 
00:29:17.509 --> 00:29:17.519 align:start position:0%
either address the deficiencies and
 
00:29:20.909 --> 00:29:20.919 align:start position:0%
repeal the July 1st
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
2022 date of this bill or or just repeal
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
the uh date if there are no
 
00:29:31.389 --> 00:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
deficiencies uh if nothing is done the
 
00:29:31.399 --> 00:29:32.669 align:start position:0%
deficiencies uh if nothing is done the
authority

00:29:32.669 --> 00:29:32.679 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
will uh will be discontinued and
 
00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:40.039 align:start position:0%
repealed on July 1st um I know one of
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
the parts of the bill that has been a
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
little bit confusing for people is part
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me section two of part one
 
00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:51.799 align:start position:0%
you'll see in there the the the language
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
is pretty much almost a duplicate of uh
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
part one excuse me section one of that
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
bill but I guess that's the way that it
 
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
had to be drafted so that part two is
 
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:05.720 align:start position:0%
the original language that is now in law
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
so if uh it's
 
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
repealed uh then it goes back to that
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
language in part two and with that I'll
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony apologize if I
 
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
repeated a lot of what people have said
 
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
the yes president M so I'm sorry
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative Daniels but for the part
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
you're testifying right before the study
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
committee you were garbled for us here
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
in the committee room I don't know about
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
the folks remotely so um so if you could
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
go back before you were talking about
 
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
the study committee and just repeat what
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
you were saying about part one and how
 
00:30:51.389 --> 00:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
it would be implemented because you were
 
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
garbled here in the
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
room okay uh yes um just just to let you
 
00:31:00.509 --> 00:31:00.519 align:start position:0%
know how things will happen is that uh
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
the bill will take effect upon passage
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
but uh it there is a date in there will
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
where it will be repealed on July 1st
 
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
2022 so essentially you know we we will
 
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
be able to do the virtual U meetings for
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
about a year but about uh 60 days after
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
passage a study committee is created to
 
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
monitor uh the the experiences of people
 
00:31:32.909 --> 00:31:32.919 align:start position:0%
using these virtual meetings and they'll
 
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
be taking taking note of any
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
deficiencies and come out with a report
 
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
on November 1st of
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
2021 uh next year and next session we
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
will be able to take the result of th
 
00:31:52.029 --> 00:31:52.039 align:start position:0%
that report and we can fix or tweak uh
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
as needed the experiences that we've
 
00:31:57.389 --> 00:31:57.399 align:start position:0%
been having or people have been having
 
00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519 align:start position:0%
with the virtual meetings so we will
 
00:32:03.149 --> 00:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
have the option of either uh addressing
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
the any deficiencies that come up and
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
then repealing the July 1st date to
 
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
allow virtual meetings to
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
continue or we if there are no
 
00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
deficiencies we can just file a bill to
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
take off the repeal date uh if nothing
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
is done then the bill will automatically
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
be repealed on July 1st
 
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:30.669 align:start position:0%
be repealed on July 1st
2022

00:32:30.669 --> 00:32:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
further question yeah F thank you for
 
00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
for taking my follow-up question so I'm
 
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
I I think you're right I am a little bit
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
confused with with part one between part
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
one of part one and part two of part one
 
00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:47.559 align:start position:0%
so if I go and I look at part one of
 
00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
part one it pretty much says physical
 
00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
location is not required and there's no
 
00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:55.039 align:start position:0%
restrictions around that but if I look
 
00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
at part two of part one
 
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
uh going on to page
 
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
three uh Roman page page three line
 
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
three accept an emergency acum of the
 
00:33:09.549 --> 00:33:09.559 align:start position:0%
public body shall be physically present
 
00:33:09.559 --> 00:33:11.230 align:start position:0%
public body shall be physically present
so

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:11.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
um so are those in conflict or am I just
 
00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
reading it
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
wrong no it's it's very confusing and
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
actually I I had to check with
 
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
legislative services to make sure there
 
00:33:25.789 --> 00:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
wasn't a problem uh section two of part
 
00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
one that part that you just read is the
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
original is that is the language in
 
00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.430 align:start position:0%
original is that is the language in
statute

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:33:36.909 --> 00:33:36.919 align:start position:0%
now okay and if you look on on page
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
three on uh line
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
26 okay you'll you'll you'll see that
 
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
says section two of part one of this act
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
shall take effect July 1st 2022
 
00:33:52.629 --> 00:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
essentially what that says is that on
 
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2022 we will revert back to the
 
00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:00.440 align:start position:0%
current language which is section two so
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
that that's the sunset Clause we were
 
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
looking for okay I got that is that is
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
the sun yes that is
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
correct so just one last followup so
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
then if this was not to pass and the
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
emergency order ends that basically
 
00:34:18.669 --> 00:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
terminates the ability for anybody to do
 
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
remote meetings is that my understanding
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
that I believe that is
 
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you sure yeah and I
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
would I would just add that uh you know
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
I I heard a little bit of Mr celik's um
 
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
comments and I would agree with them I'm
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
I'm a selectman in the town of Milford
 
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
and uh when when we had in-person
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
meetings uh before Co started we'd be
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
lucky if we had maybe three or four
 
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
people show up to those meetings uh we
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
now have somewhere between 35 and 40
 
00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
that regularly tune in and while while
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
we have uh cable Access TV those on the
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
other end could only watch what was
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
going on they couldn't participate they
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
can now participate by calling calling
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
in so it really is a win-win situation
 
00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:10.839 align:start position:0%
because it it helps us as Selectmen to
 
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
educate the public as to what's going on
 
00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
but it also helps the public because
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
meetings any other questions
 
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.190 align:start position:0%
meetings any other questions
for

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
sing thanks for your testimony today
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:47.480 align:start position:0%

G good morning chairman Gordon and
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
members of the House Judiciary Committee
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
my name is Jean Bowden and I am the Town
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
Administrator in Belmont New Hampshire
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
in March of 2020 the ability to conduct
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
municipal government changed
 
00:36:08.309 --> 00:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
dramatically catching many of us in
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
smaller communities unprepared to deal
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
with the safer at home restrictions and
 
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
the reality that remote meetings and
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
online services were going to be
 
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
necessary we had to purchase equipment
 
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
and software options that would allow
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
our boards staff and committees to meet
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
securely the governor's uh the creation
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
of the governor's office for emergency
 
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
relief and response which assisted in
 
00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
funding our equipment and software
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
upgrades was vital and truly provided us
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
the town the ability to continue to meet
 
00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:45.079 align:start position:0%
our residents needs my select board was
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
skeptical initially that the public
 
00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
would accept the remote meeting option
 
00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:50.839 align:start position:0%
they were unsure that planning and
 
00:36:52.589 --> 00:36:52.599 align:start position:0%
zoning boards would be able to provide
 
00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
adequate plan review and feedback
 
00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
through a remote process however over
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
the course of the following months Our
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
Town boards and committees became
 
00:37:04.109 --> 00:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
accustomed to the process and we found
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
that public participation increased we
 
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
successfully deliberated the development
 
00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
of the 2021 budget with a budget
 
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
committee remotely and each member of
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
the committee felt the process went
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
smoothly we have resumed our in-person
 
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
meetings um as of this month however we
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
are continuing to provide a um a link
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
via Zoom for anyone not wishing to
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
attend in person and we hope to continue
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
this option going forward we urge
 
00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to support the
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
bill as proposed and I thank you for
 
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
your time and I'm happy to answer any
 
00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:44.599 align:start position:0%

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
people to testify but everybody who
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
signed up to testify has signed up in
 
00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.309 --> 00:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you chairman Gordon and
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
representative uh Julie Gilman uh
 
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 18 uh representing exiter I
 
00:38:26.109 --> 00:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
am also a select woman in exitor and
 
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
have been since 2007 so I have seen this
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
change in our uh
 
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:36.200 align:start position:0%
meeting U method really grow in the
 
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
participation I don't want to go into
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
the details that everyone else has I
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
agree with Senator Perkins quoka uh Mr
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
selig and and uh Senator Daniels uh we
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
have seen a great amount of
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
participation and I can say over 14
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
years great um and it's the visual as
 
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
well as verbal aspect is uh is much more
 
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
uh successful in our conf in our um
 
00:39:08.829 --> 00:39:08.839 align:start position:0%
conversations um one thing I would like
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
to say about the larger participation is
 
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
that uh we see more participation by
 
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
people with families because the town
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
cannot find a substantial or or healthy
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
way to do child care during meetings of
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
like the planning board or the various
 
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
boards and commissions so we don't get
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
the people that are affected uh for a
 
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
longer range of time because they are
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
younger and perhaps cannot have a spouse
 
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
that can watch children while they're
 
00:39:44.589 --> 00:39:44.599 align:start position:0%
participating in a meeting uh so that's
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
one of the big pluses for me is that we
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
can have a greater participation of
 
00:39:52.309 --> 00:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
volunteers not just the general public
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
um And in regards to the questions about
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
the of 91a I would recommend an
 
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
amendment to uh require written minutes
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
as we do now uh because those would be
 
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
available in perpetuity and not depend
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
on the method of recording that we're
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
using um and the other is
 
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
uh the Privacy um whether or not people
 
00:40:21.309 --> 00:40:21.319 align:start position:0%
want to be seen on camera uh that we um
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
have an option to ask for permission at
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
the time that they're participating as
 
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
in this meeting you could ask me do I
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
want to uh have my face on the screen or
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
would I like to remain uh just as a a
 
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
member participating uh
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
remotely um and the last thing is about
 
00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:39.710 align:start position:0%
remotely um and the last thing is about
the

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
transportation and as you know one of
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
your members is in kissamee Florida uh
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
so you would not have a a larger
 
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
participation in your committee without
 
00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:53.720 align:start position:0%
the option of being remote for me um I
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
have epilepsy and the medication I take
 
00:40:58.670 --> 00:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow me to drive so I would not
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
be in conquered to be at this meeting
 
00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
unless representative Paige or or
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
Simpson uh gave me a ride and then I
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
would be subject to your um calendar and
 
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
would have to stay as all day or all
 
00:41:14.109 --> 00:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
morning as you are uh depending on the
 
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:17.720 align:start position:0%
schedule uh and and so that goes for all
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
the members of the public that would
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
like to speak uh you know they can't
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
make take a day off to go to conquer
 
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
they take can't take a morning off to go
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
to conquer um and I think that we really
 
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
um it's very positive result when you
 
00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
can either see people or hear from them
 
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
directly rather than the bazillion
 
00:41:38.109 --> 00:41:38.119 align:start position:0%
emails that we get on the various bills
 
00:41:38.119 --> 00:41:38.950 align:start position:0%
emails that we get on the various bills
of

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
interest and I think that is it I don't
 
00:41:43.309 --> 00:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
want to take up all your uh all your
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
time I would recommend that all uh votes
 
00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
be made by roll call if uh you choose to
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
stay in a remote uh fashion yeah I me
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
and that is it thank you very much and
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
yes meet myself thank you much Mr chair
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you much representative and select
 
00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:12.839 align:start position:0%
uh woman Gilman um something that's
 
00:42:14.349 --> 00:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
created some controversy here in the
 
00:42:17.069 --> 00:42:17.079 align:start position:0%
house is that uh you have to have your
 
00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
camera on when you're doing the roll
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
call vote but my correct understand that
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
that's not Universal with all bodies who
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
because some of them have been doing you
 
00:42:28.549 --> 00:42:28.559 align:start position:0%
know um all bodies to have remote votes
 
00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:31.559 align:start position:0%
and um so that
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh does that in your opinion is that is
 
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
that something so um you have any
 
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
opinion on that
 
00:42:40.549 --> 00:42:40.559 align:start position:0%
issue yes I would I would agree with you
 
00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079 align:start position:0%
that um as we do here in the house that
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
if you're participating member uh that
 
00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:48.280 align:start position:0%
your face be on screen because the the
 
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
as as well as the roll call vote um the
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
members of the public have to see who is

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
that any other questions for
 
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.430 align:start position:0%

Collins

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
there seems like we're having difficulty
 
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.079 --> 00:44:05.309 align:start position:0%

muted but we can't hear her for some
 
00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:20.270 align:start position:0%
muted but we can't hear her for some
reason

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%

meetings um I am uh co-founder of a
 
00:45:13.589 --> 00:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
group called The Kent Street Coalition
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%

advocacy
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
organization uh I speak here on my own
 
00:45:23.069 --> 00:45:23.079 align:start position:0%
behalf but you maybe many of you have
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
seen us at in the halls of the State
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
House back when we could do that and the
 
00:45:32.589 --> 00:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
whole purpose of our group is really to
 
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
promote engagement citizen engagement in
 
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
in our democracy
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
particularly um at the state level so
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
and this is really part of a proud
 
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
tradition in New Hampshire of robust
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
citizen engagement
 
00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.510 align:start position:0%
citizen engagement
um

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:56.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry I don't I was just seeing
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
if I could make take off my um my
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
picture and make myself live but I don't
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
see how to do that but um anyway we have
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
a proud tradition here in New Hampshire
 
00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:10.280 align:start position:0%
of Citizen engagement and this bill
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
really UND underscores that commitment
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
and with a willingness to incorporate
 
00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
new and modern tools and um while we
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
often were're at the State House many of
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
us as retired people who live here and
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
conquered we were well aware of those
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
who were not able to join us those who
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
were working who have disabilities who
 
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
were taking care of sick family members
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
or children those who couldn't drive or
 
00:46:40.589 --> 00:46:40.599 align:start position:0%
otherwise who didn't have access to
 
00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:42.839 align:start position:0%
transportation and while we would do our
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
best to represent them and their voices
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
it's obviously not the same as people
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
being able to uh be there and speak and
 
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
participate themselves um there have not
 
00:46:58.349 --> 00:46:58.359 align:start position:0%
been many benefits of covid but learning
 
00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
that we could find new ways for people
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
to participate in government was
 
00:47:05.549 --> 00:47:05.559 align:start position:0%
certainly one of those positives and I
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
think that we see evidence of that here
 
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
this morning a number of people have
 
00:47:12.069 --> 00:47:12.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know that they would not
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
have been able to be here but for remote
 
00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
access we also see it on the signin
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
sheet where in times past you know maybe
 
00:47:22.349 --> 00:47:22.359 align:start position:0%
there would have been five or 10 names
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
on those blue sheets um 50 would have
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
been cons considered a really large
 
00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:32.440 align:start position:0%
number um here we have have over hundred
 
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
um citizens who have added their voice
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
and weighed in on this process so we
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
hope that the study committee will
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
um will will meet and see that this is
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
something that enriches our Civic life
 
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
and that we'll figure out ways to make
 
00:47:56.109 --> 00:47:56.119 align:start position:0%
this a permanent part of how we do self
 
00:47:59.470 --> 00:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
government and self-governance because
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
um we benefit when we can hear from all
 
00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
the voices who make up our community so
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
um with that I Echo the words of of much
 
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:12.200 align:start position:0%
of what was said here today and
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
particularly value
 
00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
those those people who are you know
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%

00:48:23.589 --> 00:48:23.599 align:start position:0%

would you believe that uh as a
 
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:12.520 align:start position:0%

signatures on the the blue sheet uh
 
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:18.680 align:start position:0%

00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
yes so I one of my big concerns is that
 
00:49:33.069 --> 00:49:33.079 align:start position:0%
we find a way through the remote
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
signings to make it very clear who is
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
signing in as a um as a New Hampshire
 
00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:43.640 align:start position:0%
voter um or a New Hampshire resident
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
versus people signing in from across the
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
country I I think it's really um my
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
interest in this is really the ability
 
00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire citizens and New
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire res residents to participate
 
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
in self-governance so I would like to
 
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
see those those blue sheets um whether
 
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:07.240 align:start position:0%
they be remote or whether they be in
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
person really providing opportunities
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
for people to list their town and make
 
00:50:16.349 --> 00:50:16.359 align:start position:0%
it clear whether they are here to
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
participate in New Hampshire
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
self-governance or whether they are here
 
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
weighing in with an opinion from out of
 
00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:25.160 align:start position:0%
state thank you for answering my
 
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
question and I uh really value seeing
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
your face in the uh legislative office
 
00:50:32.589 --> 00:50:32.599 align:start position:0%
building along with others who are
 
00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
willing to do the hard work of showing
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
Horgan need to unmute
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
yourself unmute buttons are probably
 
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
something we will we want if we ever get
 
00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
back iners meeting some something that
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
was an issue well probably more so at
 
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
the at the legislature just because the
 
00:50:58.270 --> 00:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
way the L is set up which isn't case
 
00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
with zoom is um that you know the room
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
has essentially uh has enough room room
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
for everybody so it's not not a question
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
to cramy into a small small hearing room
 
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
so how do you uh so you think that has
 
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
changed you think that is you think the
 
00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
fact that we have have like a you know a
 
00:51:18.109 --> 00:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
virtual room that has enough room for
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
everybody you think that's changed the
 
00:51:23.549 --> 00:51:23.559 align:start position:0%
uh just sort of like uh who shows up at
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
the who shows up at the hearings and um
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
and and so for and like just s like how
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
they how they
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
go I'm sorry I'm trying to make sure I
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
understand the question oh just W um
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
just wonder if the makeup the if if you
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
found it the make of the hearings is
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps changed somewhat just by the uh
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
fact not just by the fact that people
 
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
don't that uh just we're we're now
 
00:51:49.789 --> 00:51:49.799 align:start position:0%
meeting in rooms that are big enough to
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
fit everyone who shows up and we have
 
00:51:53.309 --> 00:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
like a blue sheet that's right there at
 
00:51:55.309 --> 00:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
the website rather than sort of get in
 
00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:56.440 align:start position:0%
in the corner of the room that you have
 
00:51:58.789 --> 00:51:58.799 align:start position:0%
to fight a bunch of people off to get to
 
00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:01.240 align:start position:0%
so if you
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
found I'm sorry um yes definitely we see
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
a much more diverse um group of people
 
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
who are able to be in those rooms in
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
those virtual rooms um in terms of you
 
00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
know the people that can't take off a
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
full day from work but can take off an
 
00:52:23.069 --> 00:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
hour or people who can be home with
 
00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
their children um people who have health
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
related concerns such as epilepsy or
 
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
other reasons those people are now able
 
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
to be present in the rooms I I would
 
00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:37.839 align:start position:0%
like to just step back to something that
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
representative Silva said I agree there
 
00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
is also great value in inperson
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
engagement and interaction and so I
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
don't see this as a substitute for for
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
that um in fact I think it's one of the
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
things right now we all are very much
 
00:52:59.069 --> 00:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
missing because we know that when you
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
can um you know say hi to somebody
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
across the room or maybe in the
 
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
cafeteria share a cup of tea or have
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
those moments it helps to break down
 
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
some of the polarization that
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we're dealing with right
 
00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
now so I also think it does show a great
 
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
deal of commitment for those who are
 
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
able to come to the state house and
 
00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
participate in person my concern is
 
00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
primarily for those people who that
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
simply is not an option and there are
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
many many people who fit that category
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
and I wouldn't want to assume that
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
they're any less committed to to the
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
legislative process and to engaging in
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
government than I than I am who you know
 
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
where I happen to be able-bodied have
 
00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:49.640 align:start position:0%
transportation live fairly locally um I
 
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to make assumptions about
 
00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
those folks who aren't able to be here
 
00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:54.150 align:start position:0%
those folks who aren't able to be here
in

00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
person great thank you thank you Mr
 
00:53:59.910 --> 00:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
chair and and thank you for taking my
 
00:54:02.829 --> 00:54:02.839 align:start position:0%
question so we did hear a lot of
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
testimony so far about the enhanced
 
00:54:08.109 --> 00:54:08.119 align:start position:0%
participation but one of the things that
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
the bill does in addition to allowing
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
individual members uh to participate
 
00:54:16.829 --> 00:54:16.839 align:start position:0%
remotely the bill also allows for the
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
waving of a physical location all
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
together so in that situation um you
 
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
know as a person who's trying to you
 
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
know Drive engagement there might be
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
people that are on the fringes that
 
00:54:33.309 --> 00:54:33.319 align:start position:0%
maybe don't have access to technology or
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
whatever but because there's no physical
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
location whatsoever while other people
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
have increased opportunity for
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
participation maybe those people have
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
reduced opportunity for participation so
 
00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
as a person who works to to drive
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
engagement how would you approach that
 
00:54:52.829 --> 00:54:52.839 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
scenario I I thank you for that question
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
question and I think you make a very
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
good point again this is all about
 
00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
removing whatever barriers exist to full
 
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
participation in our demogra democratic
 
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:07.720 align:start position:0%
form of government and we know for
 
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
example that Broadband is an issue in
 
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
the North Country um and we also know
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
that that some people just quite frankly
 
00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:19.640 align:start position:0%
are better suited to in-person location
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
so I would favor whenever possible
 
00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
having a a hybrid model
 
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
um I think that that's one of the things
 
00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:30.440 align:start position:0%
that the committee would be well advised
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
to to look at and um I would you know
 
00:55:38.029 --> 00:55:38.039 align:start position:0%
hesitate to move into a system of you
 
00:55:40.589 --> 00:55:40.599 align:start position:0%
know where it's all remote all the time
 
00:55:44.589 --> 00:55:44.599 align:start position:0%
there may be reasons on occasion where
 
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
where they a physical location doesn't
 
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
make sense whether it be due to weather
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
or another health emergency or something
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
of that sort but in General personally I
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
would absolutely favor having the option
 
00:56:02.109 --> 00:56:02.119 align:start position:0%
for people to be able to show up in
 
00:56:04.589 --> 00:56:04.599 align:start position:0%
person thank you and to remove whatever
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
barriers that prevent that um as you
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned you
 
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
know in terms of any technological
 
00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
barriers and I I would hope that any
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
physical spaces that we do have that we
 
00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that those are fully
 
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
accessible um so that you know if
 
00:56:25.029 --> 00:56:25.039 align:start position:0%
someone with a disability um wants to
 
00:56:28.029 --> 00:56:28.039 align:start position:0%
come in person that there are things
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
like wheelchair ramps or you know or
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
other things that don't get in the way
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
or that promote access and that don't
 
00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:38.839 align:start position:0%
don't create barriers for people with
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
disabilities for example thank you for
 
00:56:44.029 --> 00:56:44.039 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
today and the next person to testify
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:56.990 align:start position:0%
 
Corgan

00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:59.549 --> 00:56:59.559 align:start position:0%
good morning uh Mr chairman and members
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
of the Judiciary Committee uh my name is
 
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
Kate Horan I serve as the executive
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire
 
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
Association of counties I won't repeat
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
what others have said I will just simply
 
00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
state that the association does support
 
00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
this bill um in regards to the
 
00:57:17.789 --> 00:57:17.799 align:start position:0%
electronic meetings we think it's uh a
 
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
smart way to do it uh we were involved
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
with Senator Daniels and Senator Perkins
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
quoka in drafting the legislation
 
00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
um especially around the sunset
 
00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
provision and the study committee uh we
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
have seen increased participation in
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
County meetings and we don't believe
 
00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
that covid is going any away anytime
 
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
soon so just giving us that extra
 
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
flexibility for a year while we look to
 
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
see if things uh how things can be
 
00:57:48.029 --> 00:57:48.039 align:start position:0%
improved to increase participation in
 
00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
the future uh we think is a a strong way
 
00:57:52.349 --> 00:57:52.359 align:start position:0%
to approach this and I'm happy to take
 
00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
any questions are there any questions
 
00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
from Zan again thank you for your
 
00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:12.520 align:start position:0%

and provides services for seniors and
 
00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities who wish to
 
00:58:37.589 --> 00:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
remain independent in their homes and
 
00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
communities and I'm speaking to you
 
00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
today in support of
 
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
sb95 and I'll try not to repeat anything
 
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
that's already been said but I do want
 
00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:52.039 align:start position:0%
to emphasize that remote access to
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
public meetings benefits all New
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire City citizens who wish to
 
00:58:57.789 --> 00:58:57.799 align:start position:0%
engage with their government and
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
community and even more so for seniors
 
00:59:03.309 --> 00:59:03.319 align:start position:0%
and people with disabilities who often
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
face significant barriers to
 
00:59:08.789 --> 00:59:08.799 align:start position:0%
participating in person such as lack of
 
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
public and accessible Transportation
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
need for personal care services and
 
00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
compromised health for many the only way
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
they can attend and participate in
 
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
public hearings meetings and briefings
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
is remotely via phone video streaming
 
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
and video
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
conferencing this technological ability
 
00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
to connect with their government and
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
Community makes the difference between
 
00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%
being heard and not being heard for many
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
seniors and people disabilities in New
 
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:42.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with this in mind we hope that
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
the members of this committee will chose
 
00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
to support s sp95 and allow for
 
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
continued remote access to public
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%

Grace of the New Hampshire Municipal
 
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
Association we do support this bill like
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
the association of counties we were
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
involved in assisting Senator Daniels
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
Senator Perkins quoka and the other
 
01:00:31.589 --> 01:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
sponsors in the Senate on this bill um I
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
won't repeat what you've what you've
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
heard today um you've heard a lot of
 
01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:40.039 align:start position:0%
support across the board from various
 
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
organizations um including Municipal
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
organizations and I think they pretty
 
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
clearly explained why we support this
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
bill um the only thing I would like to
 
01:00:50.349 --> 01:00:50.359 align:start position:0%
address is there was a comment made
 
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
about uh an a proposal for an amendment
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
requiring minutes
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh minutes are already required for any
 
01:00:59.950 --> 01:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
public meeting this bill would not
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
change that so whether a meeting is held
 
01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:05.240 align:start position:0%
remotely or in person minutes would be
 
01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:08.680 align:start position:0%
required I'm happy to take questions any
 
01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.190 align:start position:0%
required I'm happy to take questions any
questions

01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
for yes attorney MC uh representative MC
 
01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.190 align:start position:0%
for yes attorney MC uh representative MC
Beth

01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
Beth
 
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chair um and thank
 
01:01:22.109 --> 01:01:22.119 align:start position:0%
you um Mr gays for taking my question an
 
01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
earlier representative mentioned I think
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
the counties that um Lo elected
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
representatives were also grateful this
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
for this opportunity because they felt
 
01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
like they could educate the public and
 
01:01:35.549 --> 01:01:35.559 align:start position:0%
you know there were I guess they said
 
01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
they were getting 35 people
 
01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
participating as opposed to three or
 
01:01:40.589 --> 01:01:40.599 align:start position:0%
four and that hadn't occurred to me
 
01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:43.240 align:start position:0%
before that so I'm just wondering are
 
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
are your members are you know seeing
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
that too that it's not just the input
 
01:01:51.029 --> 01:01:51.039 align:start position:0%
from the public but it's also a way to
 
01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
educate the public and you know bring
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
them around that that's correct um so
 
01:01:58.990 --> 01:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to probably 20 or 30
 
01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
municipalities over the past year um
 
01:02:03.269 --> 01:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
that have just spontaneously said how
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
much they' like remote meetings um
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
mainly because of that public
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
participation you know as you heard from
 
01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Daniels you went from having
 
01:02:15.029 --> 01:02:15.039 align:start position:0%
three four five people who normally
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
attend to 30 or 40 um huge increases in
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
participation people who don't normally
 
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
participate whether they be elderly
 
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
whether they be disabled whether may be
 
01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
parents with young children um across
 
01:02:28.349 --> 01:02:28.359 align:start position:0%
the board there there are a lot of
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
things to like about the ability to
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
participate remotely um and people can
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
actually learn what their local
 
01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
government is doing make sure that they
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
know what their local government is
 
01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
doing and as appropriate hold those
 
01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
officials accountable in the voting
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
booth thank you very much representative
 
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Sharon just just a just a
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
quick question Mr Grace with with your
 
01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:55.160 align:start position:0%
membership how do you see um use of the
 
01:02:57.029 --> 01:02:57.039 align:start position:0%
remote breaking down currently do you
 
01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
see most people using hybrid approaches
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
do you see um a heavy use of fully
 
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
remote I guess amongst your membership
 
01:03:08.029 --> 01:03:08.039 align:start position:0%
what what do you see is the kind of
 
01:03:11.069 --> 01:03:11.079 align:start position:0%
breakdown currently I think it's very
 
01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:13.960 align:start position:0%
tailored to what municipality you're
 
01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
talking about so more rural areas with
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
less internet access are much less
 
01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
likely to use remote meetings simply
 
01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
because they understand it's more
 
01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
difficult for people to participate
 
01:03:26.029 --> 01:03:26.039 align:start position:0%
including members of the board and
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
members of the public at the same time
 
01:03:32.029 --> 01:03:32.039 align:start position:0%
um you know very connected communities
 
01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
especially those along the i93 Bor i93
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
Corridor in Southern New Hampshire more
 
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
likely to use them um simply because
 
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's what they can do it also
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
relates to I think um any sort of
 
01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
concerns that they have in their
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
communities about covid you know as
 
01:03:52.109 --> 01:03:52.119 align:start position:0%
you've as you've looked at the map over
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
the past year I'm sure you've seen some
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
communities are more more affected than
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
others um and that's certainly something
 
01:03:59.829 --> 01:03:59.839 align:start position:0%
that's been taken uh under consideration
 
01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
by Municipal officials making these
 
01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
decisions thank you any other questions
 
01:04:06.319 --> 01:04:07.269 align:start position:0%

keep them from um Coming forth if if
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%

members for the opportunity to speak my
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
name is Russell Dean and I'm the town
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
manager and exitor uh we're testifying
 
01:08:28.349 --> 01:08:28.359 align:start position:0%
in favor of the bill s
 
01:08:30.749 --> 01:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
sp95 um I just wanted to make a few
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
quick points uh one is that in the
 
01:08:36.030 --> 01:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
virtual space uh small meeting rooms
 
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
that are undersized for in-person
 
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
meetings uh are becoming as large as the
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
entire town in the virtual space so
 
01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
that's a money saver for us also with
 
01:08:47.709 --> 01:08:47.719 align:start position:0%
multiple meetings uh you can attend that
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
are running concurrently you can attend
 
01:08:52.749 --> 01:08:52.759 align:start position:0%
remotely so that's a benefit as well and
 
01:08:55.149 --> 01:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
just the final point is that regionalism
 
01:08:57.070 --> 01:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
has really been enhanced by the virtual
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
meeting space uh we did a lot of work on
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
the Great Bay and that issue and it was
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
done virtually in a better way than
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me than we could have done in
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
person so just wanted to make those
 
01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
points and thank you for the chance to
 
01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:14.199 align:start position:0%

01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:17.480 align:start position:0%

and we research and we find that
 
01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practice best model best
 
01:10:24.189 --> 01:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
practice so that we can better form the

01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%

attend these meetings when they were in
 
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:45.760 align:start position:0%

01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
those geographical
 
01:10:58.990 --> 01:10:59.000 align:start position:0%

no test no we are not expecting any
 
01:22:27.390 --> 01:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
testimony and opposition today
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
so with that we'll Begin by calling the
 
01:22:33.430 --> 01:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
primary sponsor of the bill that's
 
01:22:37.189 --> 01:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
FCA good morning chairman
 
01:22:43.070 --> 01:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
morning for the record I am Senator
 
01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
Rebecca Perkins quoka from Senate
 
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
District 21 representing the city of
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and the towns of Madbury Lee
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
Durham Newington New market and
 
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
newfields I'm the prime sponsor of 126
 
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
FN and also the prime sponsor of part
 
01:23:03.310 --> 01:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
both parts one and two of that
 
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
bill part one is intended to provide
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
some protection to tenants given the
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
high prevalence of covid related job
 
01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
loss under statutes tenants have a 7-Day
 
01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:16.280 align:start position:0%
notice period for non-payment for
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
eviction after the 7-Day period
 
01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
landlords often commence eviction
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
proceedings if they deem this
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
circumstances to Warrant it simply due
 
01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
to the amount of time it takes Pi this
 
01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
bill would simply allow the tenant to
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
make payment full payment for its rent
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
and AAR up to the date of the eviction
 
01:23:37.709 --> 01:23:37.719 align:start position:0%
Hearing in such a case the eviction
 
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
proceedings would be ended and the
 
01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
Tenant could remain in their home it
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
makes sense for landlords to keep
 
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
tenants who can pay and I think any
 
01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
landlord here today otherwise would tell
 
01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
you they agree it is extraordinary
 
01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
situations which cause us to look at
 
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
ways we can make some small tweaks to
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
give each other a little extra room to
 
01:23:59.310 --> 01:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
do the best we all can this bill does
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
not extend the time for eviction
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
overall part two of the bill enables
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
residents to apply for and receive
 
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
rental assistance prior to an eviction
 
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
notice being issued this would allow
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
people to receive help before an
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
eviction process
 
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
begins often when tenants apply for
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
assistance adding an inspection by the
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
municipality is an extra step prior to
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
tenants receiving such assistance which
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
in turn allows them to pay rent in an
 
01:24:29.790 --> 01:24:29.800 align:start position:0%
Ideal World such inspection would always
 
01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
be a check the box requirement but in
 
01:24:35.149 --> 01:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
cases where repairs are required by L he
 
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
or she may need time to make such
 
01:24:38.910 --> 01:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
Investments and the Tenant is left
 
01:24:40.830 --> 01:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
without control over the situation
 
01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
without Aid and potentially without
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
housing I think we would all agree we
 
01:24:47.669 --> 01:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
want people to remain in their homes as
 
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
it is well known that keeping someone in
 
01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
their home is a more Humane solution and
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
allows them to focus on their work and
 
01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.149 align:start position:0%
allows them to focus on their work and
their

01:24:54.149 --> 01:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%

this piece of um this part three brings
 
01:26:10.709 --> 01:26:10.719 align:start position:0%
the uh State of New Hampshire in line
 
01:26:13.790 --> 01:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
with the requirements of HUD in the past
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
what's been happening is at the work
 
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
that the Human Rights Commission does uh
 
01:26:23.109 --> 01:26:23.119 align:start position:0%
has not been um uh the federal
 
01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:26.560 align:start position:0%

Barry

01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
good morning can you hear me we can
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
great uh thank you Mr chairman members
 
01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
01:27:34.669 --> 01:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
is Elliot Barry I'm the director of
 
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
housing Justice at New Hampshire legal
 
01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
assistance uh it's a pleasure to be back
 
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh before you especially on a bill where
 
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
apparently everybody agrees that it is
 
01:27:48.189 --> 01:27:48.199 align:start position:0%
the uh prototype win-win
 
01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
situation uh again just to be really
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
clear under current current law um as a
 
01:27:56.350 --> 01:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
number of you know already if a tenant
 
01:27:59.430 --> 01:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
gets an eviction not they generally have
 
01:28:01.950 --> 01:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
seven days to pay I'm sorry for
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
non-payment of rent they basically have
 
01:28:07.470 --> 01:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
seven days to uh solve that to cure the
 
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
non-payment and if they don't um there's
 
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
no right to continue to pay and stay
 
01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
this bill um extends that until the date
 
01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
of the hearing but it also says that if
 
01:28:24.390 --> 01:28:24.400 align:start position:0%
the tenant does uh cures the non-payment
 
01:28:27.070 --> 01:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
after the landlord tenant writ has been
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
filed the 10 part of the Cure is that
 
01:28:31.950 --> 01:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
the tenant also has to pay the filing
 
01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
fee and the service costs associated
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
with uh that the landlord incurred uh
 
01:28:41.189 --> 01:28:41.199 align:start position:0%
when uh he he filed the eviction action
 
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh as was already mentioned that it adds
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
no time to the process and the great
 
01:28:49.870 --> 01:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
thing right now is I think a a number of
 
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
you probably know that the Federal
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
federal government has provided uh
 
01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars to the state uh in
 
01:29:00.310 --> 01:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
order to help uh tenants who were
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
adversely affected by covid uh to catch
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
up on their rent however and I think
 
01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
it's being administered well but nobody
 
01:29:10.590 --> 01:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
gets payment within seven days it's
 
01:29:13.109 --> 01:29:13.119 align:start position:0%
going to take much longer uh and this
 
01:29:15.149 --> 01:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
will provide the tenant with the time
 
01:29:18.669 --> 01:29:18.679 align:start position:0%
they need even when covid is over local
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
welfare administrators and Charities
 
01:29:23.950 --> 01:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
will get much more time uh to deal with
 
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
these emergency situations and again I
 
01:29:30.790 --> 01:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
think um uh it's it's a pleasure um and
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
I'm really pleased that there is so much
 
01:29:34.910 --> 01:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
support for this bill and I don't want
 
01:29:36.669 --> 01:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
to be presumptuous but I certainly
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate the support that I know many
 
01:29:40.109 --> 01:29:40.119 align:start position:0%
of you will give it and I'd be happy to
 
01:29:42.669 --> 01:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you any
 
01:29:46.109 --> 01:29:46.119 align:start position:0%

Barry see none thank you for your
 
01:30:00.510 --> 01:30:00.520 align:start position:0%

01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
with everyone in agreement um before um
 
01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
the Senate finished on this bill it was
 
01:30:19.229 --> 01:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
negotiated through and the Troublesome
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
parts that at least for us were trou
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
some were taken care of uh we had
 
01:30:27.629 --> 01:30:27.639 align:start position:0%
meetings with LA Barry we had meetings
 
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
with the director of The Human Rights
 
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
Commission and both landlord and tenant
 
01:30:35.709 --> 01:30:35.719 align:start position:0%
communities are in agreement with this
 
01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
bill as it stands as it came from the
 
01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
Senate the part one uh as you heard
 
01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
would change it so that the tenants
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
would have until the court hearing to
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
pay what they owe but what they would
 
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
have to do at that point is is to pay
 
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
all lawful charges owed to that point so
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
simple language there is that it would
 
01:31:00.030 --> 01:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
make landlords whole so if the tenant
 
01:31:01.629 --> 01:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
makes the landlord hold by the time of
 
01:31:03.629 --> 01:31:03.639 align:start position:0%
the hearing it's totally reasonable that
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
they would stay in their um
 
01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
location uh the provisions that some of
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
you may know could be Loosely termed
 
01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
fourth strike you're out that remains so
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
if a tenant was constantly behind and
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
used this clause three times in a
 
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
12-month period on the fourth time then
 
01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719 align:start position:0%
it would become the option for the
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
landlord to say not you know even if
 
01:31:30.910 --> 01:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
you're paying up we still would rather
 
01:31:34.109 --> 01:31:34.119 align:start position:0%
not continue um it's true that this does
 
01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
not add any time to the total eviction
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
cost whether it was existing law or with
 
01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
this change the
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
timetable the the full timetable is the
 
01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
same so part two is really simple it
 
01:31:58.229 --> 01:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
just says that the welfare departments
 
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
giving rental assistance cannot hold
 
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
back giving that assistance if the
 
01:32:06.990 --> 01:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
tenant doesn't have an eviction
 
01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
notice um we think that's a good thing
 
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh in present law occasionally you have
 
01:32:17.109 --> 01:32:17.119 align:start position:0%
a welfare department that says we're not
 
01:32:19.229 --> 01:32:19.239 align:start position:0%
going to entertain giving assistance to
 
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
a tenant unless they come to us with an
 
01:32:21.199 --> 01:32:22.310 align:start position:0%
a tenant unless they come to us with an
eviction

01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
eviction
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
notice which just seems silly like
 
01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to get assistance so they
 
01:32:27.590 --> 01:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
don't get
 
01:32:30.990 --> 01:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
evicted um and in practice we've had
 
01:32:34.109 --> 01:32:34.119 align:start position:0%
many times where uh tenant is trying to
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
get assistance and then we we have to
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
give them an eviction notice so they can
 
01:32:41.149 --> 01:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
go to the town to uh to get that
 
01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
assistance it just seems like an un
 
01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um delay and needless
 
01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:49.070 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um delay and needless
eviction

01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
eviction
 
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
notices part three is all about about
 
01:32:54.390 --> 01:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
bringing New Hampshire discrimination
 
01:32:57.790 --> 01:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
law language to be the same as Federal
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
language we did have a big meeting uh
 
01:33:04.229 --> 01:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
with the Director of Human Rights and
 
01:33:07.470 --> 01:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
our real estate core team specialist
 
01:33:10.270 --> 01:33:10.280 align:start position:0%
that specializes in discrimination law
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
poured through it fairly well with a
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
fine tooth comb the things that
 
01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
were changing New Hampshire law were
 
01:33:21.629 --> 01:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
removed so all that's left here is
 
01:33:23.470 --> 01:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
bringing New Hampshire law into
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
compliance with federal law when I say
 
01:33:28.149 --> 01:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
changing New Hampshire law I guess I
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
should say changing the entire picture
 
01:33:34.149 --> 01:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
between Federal and and state with the
 
01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
bill as it is now the total picture of
 
01:33:39.629 --> 01:33:39.639 align:start position:0%
the Discrimination law is not changing
 
01:33:41.470 --> 01:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire's language is now
 
01:33:44.030 --> 01:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
mirroing Federal language that just
 
01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
makes it every easier for everybody
 
01:33:49.229 --> 01:33:49.239 align:start position:0%
involved in the process to have one set
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
of uh rules guidelines language to to
 
01:33:55.950 --> 01:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
deal with I'd be very very happy to to
 
01:33:56.990 --> 01:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
take any
 
01:34:02.189 --> 01:34:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:05.109 --> 01:34:05.119 align:start position:0%
Norman seeing none thank you for your
 
01:34:08.189 --> 01:34:08.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
much there
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159 align:start position:0%

chairman Gordon and members of the
 
01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee excuse me uh my name
 
01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
is Annie Malachi I am the executive
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
director of the commission for human
 
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
rights uh the commission certainly is in
 
01:34:44.430 --> 01:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
support of sb26 and would ask that the
 
01:34:46.510 --> 01:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
committee would support this bill as
 
01:34:50.590 --> 01:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
amended uh this piece of legislation as
 
01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
others have spoken uh specifically part
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
three uh is needed to allow the
 
01:34:56.109 --> 01:34:56.119 align:start position:0%
commission to begin the Contracting
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
process with HUD upon approval this
 
01:35:02.470 --> 01:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
workshare agreement uh would reimburse
 
01:35:05.310 --> 01:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
the commission for work that it work
 
01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
work that it does already and elements
 
01:35:11.149 --> 01:35:11.159 align:start position:0%
completed this work is something that
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
the commission currently does um and
 
01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
there are some language changes which
 
01:35:19.709 --> 01:35:19.719 align:start position:0%
Nick Norman specified um that are
 
01:35:22.189 --> 01:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
addressed in this bill to allow the
 
01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire to be what is
 
01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
called substantially equivalent with the
 
01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
federal fair housing act um and as Mr
 
01:35:33.070 --> 01:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
Norman pointed out and Mr Barry um there
 
01:35:35.229 --> 01:35:35.239 align:start position:0%
were several meetings had with various
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to explain and improve upon
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
the original Bill and through the
 
01:35:42.750 --> 01:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
addition of an amendment addressed the
 
01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
concerns that the stakeholders had um I
 
01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
think that encapsulates basically
 
01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
everything thank you for your time and
 
01:35:53.070 --> 01:35:53.080 align:start position:0%

Brandon

01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
see oh sorry about that hello everybody
 
01:36:31.629 --> 01:36:31.639 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Brandon lame uh I am
 
01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
representing rights and democracy I am
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
the housing Justice organizer for them
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh I'm here speaking in favor of Senate
 
01:36:41.550 --> 01:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
Bill 126 um I really don't want to
 
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
reiterate what's already been said um
 
01:36:46.510 --> 01:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
and I think I just want to emphasize uh
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
I don't really think that this bill is
 
01:36:50.189 --> 01:36:50.199 align:start position:0%
controversial uh to anybody uh because
 
01:36:52.669 --> 01:36:52.679 align:start position:0%
it benefits both tenants and landlords
 
01:36:55.149 --> 01:36:55.159 align:start position:0%
alike uh making it easier for folks to
 
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
access assistance uh before receiving an
 
01:36:59.229 --> 01:36:59.239 align:start position:0%
eviction notice is a great step to
 
01:37:01.149 --> 01:37:01.159 align:start position:0%
ensure that residents can stay in their
 
01:37:03.109 --> 01:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
homes and that landlords can get the
 
01:37:06.270 --> 01:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
income at the same time um simply put I
 
01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
just think that this is a winwin um and
 
01:37:10.669 --> 01:37:10.679 align:start position:0%
as it's been stated part three just make
 
01:37:12.629 --> 01:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
sure that our codes are in line with
 
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
other states and the federal government
 
01:37:16.270 --> 01:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
um ensuring that we can have access to
 
01:37:19.629 --> 01:37:19.639 align:start position:0%
vital federal funds uh so and as we all
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
know uh tackling the housing Cris in New
 
01:37:24.189 --> 01:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will require some of these
 
01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
federal funds um so I think I'm just
 
01:37:28.229 --> 01:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
going to wrap that up I don't want to
 
01:37:30.270 --> 01:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
Again State what's already been stated
 
01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
so I thank you very much for your
 
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
time thank thank you for your testimony
 
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:38.280 align:start position:0%

01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to you I'll try to
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
be brief this morning and not repeat um
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
some of the comments made by other folks
 
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm speaking to you this morning um
 
01:38:13.229 --> 01:38:13.239 align:start position:0%
wearing two hats I am both the executive
 
01:38:15.790 --> 01:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
director of Crossroads house one of our
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
state's homeless shelters for
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
individuals and families I am also
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
speaking to you as a member of housing
 
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
action New Hampshire um I speak as many
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
others have already in favor of SB 1226
 
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
um I certainly support the opportunity
 
01:38:36.830 --> 01:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
for any tenant to make payments to be
 
01:38:39.790 --> 01:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
able to um catch up and as others have
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
said um make a landlord whole before um
 
01:38:46.990 --> 01:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
they are are Lo actually in a position
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
where they're losing their housing unit
 
01:38:51.229 --> 01:38:51.239 align:start position:0%
from my perspective as the Director of
 
01:38:54.149 --> 01:38:54.159 align:start position:0%
an emergency shelter once someone is
 
01:38:56.350 --> 01:38:56.360 align:start position:0%
evicted and and becomes homeless if they
 
01:38:58.030 --> 01:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
don't have anywhere to go it's
 
01:39:00.790 --> 01:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily difficult to get back
 
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
into a new apartment both because they
 
01:39:05.669 --> 01:39:05.679 align:start position:0%
may have an eviction on their record but
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
also just because as I'm sure you're
 
01:39:10.109 --> 01:39:10.119 align:start position:0%
well aware the housing rental housing
 
01:39:13.390 --> 01:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
stock is is very very low in our region
 
01:39:16.149 --> 01:39:16.159 align:start position:0%
it's a we have a 1% vacancy rate and the
 
01:39:18.990 --> 01:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
prices are Sky High so everything we can
 
01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
do to support tenants to be able to
 
01:39:24.189 --> 01:39:24.199 align:start position:0%
catch up on their rent um is is
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
definitely a great strategy um because
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
as we see once people have um been
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
forced to move out of their Apartments
 
01:39:33.790 --> 01:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
the lengths of stay that we're finding
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
in shelters in our state is rising as
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
are the number of people experiencing
 
01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
homelessness um excuse me in addition um
 
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
we are we're getting very close to the
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
end of the eviction moratorium um that
 
01:39:51.589 --> 01:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
ends on June 30th and so we're already
 
01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
starting to see um you know we
 
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
anticipate there could be a surge in
 
01:39:59.790 --> 01:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
those who are um are potentially going
 
01:40:03.790 --> 01:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
to be evicted and the this new um policy
 
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
would allow more people the opportunity
 
01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of the federal
 
01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
resources that you've heard about as
 
01:40:12.629 --> 01:40:12.639 align:start position:0%
well that are available um to be able to
 
01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
catch up on on their rent so as we start
 
01:40:16.990 --> 01:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
to see an increase already in the
 
01:40:20.189 --> 01:40:20.199 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant eviction cases um this
 
01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
certainly be a helpful
 
01:40:26.589 --> 01:40:26.599 align:start position:0%
policy and um I think the rest people
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
have already said I just wanted to also
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
add that um housing action New Hampshire
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
also supports part two so that welfare
 
01:40:35.310 --> 01:40:35.320 align:start position:0%
support is able to flow without
 
01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:38.719 align:start position:0%
requiring notices of eviction so um
 
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
that's it again wearing both my hats
 
01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
from an emergency shelter provider and
 
01:40:45.149 --> 01:40:45.159 align:start position:0%
as a member of housing action New
 
01:40:47.709 --> 01:40:47.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I thank you for um
 
01:40:49.629 --> 01:40:49.639 align:start position:0%
allowing me this
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
time repres pres MC Beth did you have a
 
01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you um Mr chair and
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
thank you m stone for taking my question
 
01:41:00.750 --> 01:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that um the evictions are
 
01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
once someone's homeless the the length
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
of stay is longer it impacts the length
 
01:41:07.149 --> 01:41:07.159 align:start position:0%
of stay what's negative about the length
 
01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
of stay what what what are the Fallout
 
01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
from that yes so um I've been tracking
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
our length of stay at our shelter and
 
01:41:18.229 --> 01:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
it's significantly increased by um more
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
than 20% over the past um five or six
 
01:41:24.109 --> 01:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
years we're up to 103 days is the
 
01:41:27.070 --> 01:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
average so we have some people that are
 
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
um you know some people who stay in a
 
01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
shelter may come in just literally for a
 
01:41:33.629 --> 01:41:33.639 align:start position:0%
couple of days they're in they're out
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
they're not really seeking our full
 
01:41:37.709 --> 01:41:37.719 align:start position:0%
array of Supportive Services but those
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
who come and engage and get case
 
01:41:40.990 --> 01:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
management and are actually looking to
 
01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
get back on their feet and back in an
 
01:41:44.589 --> 01:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
apartment it can take months and months
 
01:41:46.750 --> 01:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
and months with the waiting lists for
 
01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
public housing being lengthy But to
 
01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
answer your question the negative impact
 
01:41:55.070 --> 01:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
of an increased length of stay is
 
01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
that for every person that has to stay
 
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
in an emergency shelter they're taking
 
01:42:02.510 --> 01:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
up a bed that is not available for the
 
01:42:04.990 --> 01:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
next person who needs it and so
 
01:42:07.709 --> 01:42:07.719 align:start position:0%
especially given our covid restrictions
 
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
to um last night we had 66 people
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
sleeping at our shelter um we've been
 
01:42:15.870 --> 01:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
averaging more like 70 to 80 during
 
01:42:19.390 --> 01:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
covid but a year ago March when the
 
01:42:22.270 --> 01:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic hit we had 100 20 people in our
 
01:42:25.629 --> 01:42:25.639 align:start position:0%
shelter and we were able to kind of pack
 
01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
people in if you will which is not the
 
01:42:29.629 --> 01:42:29.639 align:start position:0%
most Humane thing to do but it's better
 
01:42:33.589 --> 01:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
than sleeping outside um but most well
 
01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:35.560 align:start position:0%
all emergency shelters in the state are
 
01:42:39.550 --> 01:42:39.560 align:start position:0%
still limited in our ability to utilize
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
all of our space due to covid
 
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
restrictions so every night that a bed
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
is occupied by someone because they
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
can't get into housing um it's not
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
available to someone else and our
 
01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
ability to flex to get more people in is
 
01:42:57.030 --> 01:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
still limited so I hope that answers
 
01:42:59.149 --> 01:42:59.159 align:start position:0%
your question if not I'm happy for a
 
01:43:01.390 --> 01:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
followup no thank you very much thank
 
01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:02.719 align:start position:0%

01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
for single men single women and we have
 
01:43:31.709 --> 01:43:31.719 align:start position:0%
separate spaces for families as
 
01:43:35.709 --> 01:43:35.719 align:start position:0%

01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
our families um and individuals at our
 
01:43:40.109 --> 01:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
shelter and we continue to keep a few
 
01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
people um using local motel rooms which
 
01:43:46.229 --> 01:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
was a strategy we employed during Co to
 
01:43:49.830 --> 01:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
increase our capacity to meet the need
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
but yes we do to shelter both families
 
01:43:54.189 --> 01:43:54.199 align:start position:0%
and individuals and we have infants
 
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.040 align:start position:0%

support for section three of Senate Bill
 
01:44:46.750 --> 01:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
126 the Realtors worked with the Human
 
01:44:48.270 --> 01:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission to craft an amendment
 
01:44:50.669 --> 01:44:50.679 align:start position:0%
to the Senate Bill 126 prior to the hear
 
01:44:53.149 --> 01:44:53.159 align:start position:0%
in in the Senate those changes added
 
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
definitions and clarified discriminatory
 
01:44:58.350 --> 01:44:58.360 align:start position:0%
acts which aligned with existing federal
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
laws all of our questions and concerns
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
were dealt with in that Amendment so we
 
01:45:04.030 --> 01:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
fully support the passage of that
 
01:45:06.669 --> 01:45:06.679 align:start position:0%
section in the past our industry has
 
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
played a regrettable role in
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
perpetuating discrimination in the home
 
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
buying process while much of the of
 
01:45:15.310 --> 01:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
while much work has been accomplished
 
01:45:17.790 --> 01:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
over the past decades such as ending red
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
lining and discriminatory restrictive C
 
01:45:24.669 --> 01:45:24.679 align:start position:0%
we still have the long way to go RSA

04:01:49.870 --> 04:01:49.880 align:start position:0%

um the first bill is sen Bill 41
 
04:02:00.910 --> 04:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
relative to police disciplinary
 
04:02:04.149 --> 04:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
hearings I note that we uh we only heard
 
04:02:06.750 --> 04:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
from one speaker on the bill and that
 
04:02:11.149 --> 04:02:11.159 align:start position:0%
was from the attorney this the primary
 
04:02:18.149 --> 04:02:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:21.269 --> 04:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
appear I was gonna make a motion when we
 
04:02:25.149 --> 04:02:25.159 align:start position:0%
ready oh thank you Mr chair um um I'd
 
04:02:28.830 --> 04:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion uh to uh retain uh
 
04:02:31.910 --> 04:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
sp41 and speak to that
 
04:02:36.110 --> 04:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
motion uh yeah thank you Mr chair so um
 
04:02:39.349 --> 04:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
when the ACLU came in and they testified
 
04:02:42.710 --> 04:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
on this bill they supported the bill um
 
04:02:44.550 --> 04:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot that that's good about
 
04:02:48.070 --> 04:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
it for transparency point of view
 
04:02:50.030 --> 04:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
however they did recommend retention
 
04:02:52.870 --> 04:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
because there was a parallel Bill HB
 
04:02:55.550 --> 04:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
471 uh that was going through and they
 
04:02:57.750 --> 04:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
felt that the language was cleaner there
 
04:03:00.750 --> 04:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that we had was um
 
04:03:03.790 --> 04:03:03.800 align:start position:0%
when you make a petition um who was it
 
04:03:06.950 --> 04:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
made to that wasn't specified in sb41
 
04:03:12.830 --> 04:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
and it is an hb4 471 so um I just would
 
04:03:14.630 --> 04:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
ask that we retain the bill until we
 
04:03:22.469 --> 04:03:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:25.389 --> 04:03:25.399 align:start position:0%
471 I should asked is there a second
 
04:03:25.399 --> 04:03:27.349 align:start position:0%
471 I should asked is there a second
motion

04:03:27.349 --> 04:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
motion
 
04:03:34.870 --> 04:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:38.110 --> 04:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
by and is there any other discussion yes
 
04:03:38.120 --> 04:03:40.189 align:start position:0%
by and is there any other discussion yes
representative

04:03:40.189 --> 04:03:40.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:03:42.670 --> 04:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
bur uh thank you Mr
 
04:03:46.189 --> 04:03:46.199 align:start position:0%
chair um in I'm kind of puzzled since
 
04:03:49.030 --> 04:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
there was no objection to the bill uh
 
04:03:50.830 --> 04:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
why we need to retain it or what would
 
04:03:54.070 --> 04:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
really be gained by uh spending
 
04:03:56.710 --> 04:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
summertime working on it the the
 
04:03:59.910 --> 04:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
question that uh uh my good friend just
 
04:04:04.550 --> 04:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
raised as to who should be petitioned as
 
04:04:07.630 --> 04:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
referred to in line six of the bill it
 
04:04:10.790 --> 04:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
was see fairly obvious at least to me
 
04:04:13.550 --> 04:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
that if we're if there's a disciplinary
 
04:04:16.110 --> 04:04:16.120 align:start position:0%
hearing and one of the parties has a
 
04:04:19.790 --> 04:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
requests it would go to uh the person or
 
04:04:23.349 --> 04:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
persons conducting the hearing uh and
 
04:04:27.510 --> 04:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
they would ask um that uh a decision be
 
04:04:30.750 --> 04:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
made on on closure so I I I think the
 
04:04:33.990 --> 04:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
the bill is pretty clear as to um what
 
04:04:37.550 --> 04:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
is required and I think there's at least
 
04:04:39.429 --> 04:04:39.439 align:start position:0%
from my perspective no problem if we
 
04:04:46.630 --> 04:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:50.810 --> 04:04:50.820 align:start position:0%
bill than chair so all
 
04:04:50.820 --> 04:04:54.189 align:start position:0%
bill than chair so all
[Music]

04:04:54.189 --> 04:04:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:57.670 --> 04:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
respect sent a good bill to theate we
 
04:04:59.910 --> 04:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
don't need we are hling over two
 
04:05:02.429 --> 04:05:02.439 align:start position:0%
separate bills de the same thing so
 
04:05:04.469 --> 04:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
let's just hle all we one we can retain
 
04:05:06.510 --> 04:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
this if something could happen
 
04:05:09.110 --> 04:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
471 somehow doesn't go all the way
 
04:05:11.269 --> 04:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
through and we'll still have
 
04:05:14.229 --> 04:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
it to work on
 
04:05:18.269 --> 04:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:25.149 --> 04:05:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:29.309 --> 04:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:32.950 --> 04:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
discussion I I do recall uh I had asked
 
04:05:35.269 --> 04:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
some questions about the
 
04:05:39.349 --> 04:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
bill and the
 
04:05:43.550 --> 04:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
the and I I remember attorney
 
04:05:46.830 --> 04:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
banet indicated that the other Bill
 
04:05:51.830 --> 04:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill 471 was clearer and one was I
 
04:05:53.950 --> 04:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
know one of the questions was it
 
04:05:55.990 --> 04:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
mentions confidential information but it
 
04:05:58.349 --> 04:05:58.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't Define confidential information
 
04:05:59.670 --> 04:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
in this
 
04:06:03.189 --> 04:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
bill and it uses the term compelling
 
04:06:06.429 --> 04:06:06.439 align:start position:0%
interest but it doesn't explain what
 
04:06:09.750 --> 04:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
creates what might create a compelling
 
04:06:12.750 --> 04:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
interest and it also doesn't specify in
 
04:06:15.870 --> 04:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
here who actually makes the decisions to
 
04:06:19.910 --> 04:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
whether there's a compelling interest so
 
04:06:23.030 --> 04:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
I think that was and and he indicated
 
04:06:26.149 --> 04:06:26.159 align:start position:0%
that he thought House Bill 471 was
 
04:06:29.429 --> 04:06:29.439 align:start position:0%
clearer and that we should prend we
 
04:06:32.070 --> 04:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
should retain the
 
04:06:36.389 --> 04:06:36.399 align:start position:0%
bill representative bir uh in view of
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%

uh made by my colleagues here uh I will
 
04:06:46.590 --> 04:06:46.600 align:start position:0%

McBeth thank you I just the the the um
 
04:10:24.389 --> 04:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
audio is very garbled it's very
 
04:10:27.109 --> 04:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
difficult to hear it sound I think it's
 
04:10:28.670 --> 04:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
every one of you that was just talking
 
04:10:35.070 --> 04:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:39.790 --> 04:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
w as I'm speaking right now is it is it
 
04:10:45.149 --> 04:10:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:49.309 --> 04:10:49.319 align:start position:0%
you move on to Senate Bill
 
04:10:53.109 --> 04:10:53.119 align:start position:0%
143 which is an Omnibus
 
04:10:56.269 --> 04:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
Bill dealing with certain agency
 
04:10:59.070 --> 04:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
requests and the plan I think the plan
 
04:11:02.229 --> 04:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
is to go through part by part because I
 
04:11:05.109 --> 04:11:05.119 align:start position:0%
know there are amendments relative to
 
04:11:08.309 --> 04:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
certain parts in the bill
 
04:11:09.750 --> 04:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
the first part being appointment of
 
04:11:11.790 --> 04:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
council for a minor and a juvenile
 
04:11:11.800 --> 04:11:23.790 align:start position:0%
council for a minor and a juvenile
delinquency

04:11:23.790 --> 04:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:26.590 --> 04:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
proceeding I I know that there are there
 
04:11:29.950 --> 04:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
have been a couple different amendments
 
04:11:35.429 --> 04:11:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:38.550 --> 04:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
bir uh thank you Mr share I I guess my
 
04:11:40.349 --> 04:11:40.359 align:start position:0%
first question is a bit
 
04:11:44.429 --> 04:11:44.439 align:start position:0%
procedural um I do have an amendment to
 
04:11:48.590 --> 04:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
present and would offer which is uh uh
 
04:11:48.600 --> 04:11:52.189 align:start position:0%
present and would offer which is uh uh
1267

04:11:52.189 --> 04:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:56.510 --> 04:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
H I don't know if there is going to be
 
04:11:59.389 --> 04:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
um an amendment
 
04:12:01.910 --> 04:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh which has a
 
04:12:06.269 --> 04:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
senate uh heading on it from Senator
 
04:12:10.309 --> 04:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
Carson in some
 
04:12:13.510 --> 04:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
respects it's better to compare and
 
04:12:15.790 --> 04:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
contrast the two from my
 
04:12:18.429 --> 04:12:18.439 align:start position:0%
perspective uh rather than have two
 
04:12:21.429 --> 04:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
separate consecutive arguments the
 
04:12:25.109 --> 04:12:25.119 align:start position:0%
number on her bill or or amendment is
 
04:12:28.510 --> 04:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
0969 s and I'm not sure procedurally
 
04:12:33.429 --> 04:12:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:35.630 --> 04:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
introduced can't take
 
04:12:38.950 --> 04:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
us okay my clerk tells me that we can't
 
04:12:42.790 --> 04:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
take a senate Amendment all right in
 
04:12:47.070 --> 04:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
that case I will speak to um 1267 but
 
04:12:48.990 --> 04:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
first I would move its
 
04:12:54.590 --> 04:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:59.950 --> 04:12:59.960 align:start position:0%
just so I thought we could uh offer a as
 
04:13:01.269 --> 04:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
long as somebody from the committee
 
04:13:02.750 --> 04:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
offer the
 
04:13:05.070 --> 04:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that was uh I think that was
 
04:13:07.389 --> 04:13:07.399 align:start position:0%
our understanding that if somebody when
 
04:13:09.870 --> 04:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
the committee offered the amendment then
 
04:13:16.269 --> 04:13:16.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:20.149 --> 04:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
satisfactory do do you yeah so it would
 
04:13:24.389 --> 04:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
be my opinion that's all it is uh that
 
04:13:27.510 --> 04:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
we are if we agree to the am language of
 
04:13:31.349 --> 04:13:31.359 align:start position:0%
the amendment we can agree to the
 
04:13:35.830 --> 04:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
amendment 10 number change but yes we
 
04:13:39.030 --> 04:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
can't officially cannot put an S
 
04:13:41.950 --> 04:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment Senate
 
04:13:43.950 --> 04:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment if we agree that's what we
 
04:13:56.429 --> 04:13:56.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:59.070 --> 04:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
do is uh I guess I'm looking to the
 
04:14:01.429 --> 04:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
committee what I can do is uh I can have
 
04:14:04.229 --> 04:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
this sent over I'll have the researcher
 
04:14:06.830 --> 04:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
send it over and convert it into a house
 
04:14:09.229 --> 04:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
of Amendment and then we'll come back to
 
04:14:11.349 --> 04:14:11.359 align:start position:0%
part one if you'd like to do
 
04:14:14.510 --> 04:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
that does that make
 
04:14:18.870 --> 04:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
sense I think it does and I I
 
04:14:28.109 --> 04:14:28.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:30.630 --> 04:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
so so do we want to skip part one we'll
 
04:14:32.790 --> 04:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
come back to part
 
04:14:36.070 --> 04:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
one would that be okay with everyone yes
 
04:14:38.990 --> 04:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
yes that's fine we
 
04:14:42.790 --> 04:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
all okay part two relative to recovery

this

04:16:29.389 --> 04:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:16:31.510 --> 04:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
amendment is there a second to the
 
04:16:34.870 --> 04:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
amendment I'll second it okay I I think
 
04:16:38.990 --> 04:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
I saw representative MCB in

chair I strongly ask that you um support
 
04:16:56.189 --> 04:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
this amendment which removes section two
 
04:16:59.309 --> 04:16:59.319 align:start position:0%

unit the Union has 11 employees
 
04:17:13.389 --> 04:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
full-time one part-time and a cost of
 
04:17:17.389 --> 04:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
about 990 million a
 
04:17:21.670 --> 04:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
year currently state law allows recovery
 
04:17:23.830 --> 04:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
only from future
 
04:17:26.750 --> 04:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
grants this section will require a
 
04:17:28.710 --> 04:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
recipient of Public Assistance to pay
 
04:17:30.429 --> 04:17:30.439 align:start position:0%
the department back for what the
 
04:17:33.510 --> 04:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
department determines are unauthorized
 
04:17:37.269 --> 04:17:37.279 align:start position:0%
payments made to that person in the past
 
04:17:38.830 --> 04:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
the term
 
04:17:42.510 --> 04:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
unauthorized is an interesting term in
 
04:17:45.510 --> 04:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
fact the department authorized the
 
04:17:48.070 --> 04:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
payments and that's why the payments
 
04:17:48.080 --> 04:17:49.070 align:start position:0%
payments and that's why the payments
were

04:17:49.070 --> 04:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:17:51.910 --> 04:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
made subsequent
 
04:17:55.790 --> 04:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
investigation raised questions about the
 
04:17:59.429 --> 04:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
payments um in some cases it might be
 
04:18:01.950 --> 04:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
that the recipient filled out a form
 
04:18:04.429 --> 04:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
incorrectly or did not know that they
 
04:18:07.590 --> 04:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
had to reapply every year
 
04:18:09.950 --> 04:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
in some cases the department made a
 
04:18:12.910 --> 04:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
mistake in calculating the payment the
 
04:18:14.950 --> 04:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
department made the mistake in
 
04:18:17.830 --> 04:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
calculating the payment this is the
 
04:18:19.950 --> 04:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
Department's reasoning of why they want
 
04:18:23.309 --> 04:18:23.319 align:start position:0%
to be able to seek money
 
04:18:25.389 --> 04:18:25.399 align:start position:0%
retroactively I was told that if a
 
04:18:27.830 --> 04:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
person's been able to do everything that
 
04:18:30.870 --> 04:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
expected of him or her and is able to
 
04:18:35.389 --> 04:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
withdraw from receiving any public
 
04:18:38.910 --> 04:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
assistance um because they are now
 
04:18:43.790 --> 04:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
earning money um that is the time to ask
 
04:18:45.790 --> 04:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
them to
 
04:18:49.630 --> 04:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
repay um a mistaken payment the mistake
 
04:18:51.429 --> 04:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
might have been made by the recipient
 
04:18:53.109 --> 04:18:53.119 align:start position:0%
and it might have been made by the
 
04:18:56.670 --> 04:18:56.680 align:start position:0%
department so at the very time that the
 
04:18:59.070 --> 04:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
recipient has been able to do exactly
 
04:19:01.189 --> 04:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
what we want them to do has been able to
 
04:19:05.870 --> 04:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
get a job and barely pull themselves out
 
04:19:10.510 --> 04:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
and above line of of uh being able to
 
04:19:13.389 --> 04:19:13.399 align:start position:0%
support themselves at that very moment
 
04:19:15.710 --> 04:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
that's when the department would swoop
 
04:19:21.229 --> 04:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
in and um and uh and ask for repayment
 
04:19:23.750 --> 04:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
and the reason in is because that's the
 
04:19:26.309 --> 04:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
time when they might have the money of
 
04:19:29.510 --> 04:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
course by doing this it's very possible
 
04:19:31.670 --> 04:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
that the recipient will then fall below
 
04:19:34.429 --> 04:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
the line again and have to start the
 
04:19:37.229 --> 04:19:37.239 align:start position:0%
process all over of trying trying to get
 
04:19:39.710 --> 04:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
back on his or her
 
04:19:43.309 --> 04:19:43.319 align:start position:0%
feet might make sense to you it doesn't
 
04:19:46.070 --> 04:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
make sense to me they have a program
 
04:19:48.950 --> 04:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
they refer to as Fred
 
04:19:51.830 --> 04:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
frontend detection I love those cute
 
04:19:53.710 --> 04:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
names for
 
04:19:56.309 --> 04:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
programs about half the money they take
 
04:19:59.189 --> 04:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
credit for falls into this category
 
04:20:02.630 --> 04:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
which they refer to as cost avoidance in
 
04:20:04.389 --> 04:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
other words this is money that they have
 
04:20:07.790 --> 04:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
not spent cost avoidance
 
04:20:10.149 --> 04:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
but where they have caught errors before
 
04:20:12.510 --> 04:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
payment was made I asked how much
 
04:20:15.189 --> 04:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
related to errors in calculations made
 
04:20:16.109 --> 04:20:16.119 align:start position:0%
by the
 
04:20:19.070 --> 04:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
department rather than misstatements
 
04:20:21.070 --> 04:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
made by the potential recipient they
 
04:20:24.030 --> 04:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
could not answer that question I asked
 
04:20:26.469 --> 04:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
how much money was C categorized as
 
04:20:28.990 --> 04:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
general fund dollars rather than total
 
04:20:31.550 --> 04:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
dollars they could not answer that
 
04:20:34.229 --> 04:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
question other than cost avoidance as
 
04:20:36.710 --> 04:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
discussed above the amount they collect
 
04:20:40.790 --> 04:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
is about the same perhaps a little less
 
04:20:43.870 --> 04:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
as they spend on salaries and
 
04:20:46.510 --> 04:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
benefits I do not have the figure on how
 
04:20:48.670 --> 04:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
much they spend in other categories in
 
04:20:51.830 --> 04:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
the budget I do not believe that anyone
 
04:20:54.030 --> 04:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
who deliberately misrepresents their
 
04:20:56.670 --> 04:20:56.680 align:start position:0%
financial circumstances should be
 
04:20:59.070 --> 04:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
protected legitimate procedures should
 
04:21:01.229 --> 04:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
be followed to collect money for which
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
the recipient was not eligible but if
 
04:21:05.990 --> 04:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
the department is responsible for the
 
04:21:08.429 --> 04:21:08.439 align:start position:0%
error then I do not think the recipient
 
04:21:10.870 --> 04:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
should be punished I want to remove
 
04:21:13.790 --> 04:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
section two that adds the ability to go
 
04:21:16.149 --> 04:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
after someone no longer receiving aid
 
04:21:19.309 --> 04:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
and I hope you will support
 
04:21:22.189 --> 04:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
me I believe that government plays an
 
04:21:25.109 --> 04:21:25.119 align:start position:0%
important role in a Democratic Society
 
04:21:27.030 --> 04:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
but I do not believe that government
 
04:21:29.870 --> 04:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
should have unlimited power and I hope
 
04:21:32.710 --> 04:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
you agree with me on that if in the
 
04:21:34.030 --> 04:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
fullness of
 
04:21:37.750 --> 04:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
time the department is able to provide
 
04:21:40.990 --> 04:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
better explanation of this program and
 
04:21:44.590 --> 04:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that the guilty are in fact
 
04:21:46.550 --> 04:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
held guilty and the innocent are
 
04:21:48.750 --> 04:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
protected then I would be the first one
 
04:21:51.870 --> 04:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
to support the effort but today I really
 
04:21:54.189 --> 04:21:54.199 align:start position:0%
hope you will agree with me that this
 
04:21:57.109 --> 04:21:57.119 align:start position:0%
section is not ready for prime time and
 
04:21:59.870 --> 04:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
I would ask you to support the amendment
 
04:21:59.880 --> 04:22:00.750 align:start position:0%
I would ask you to support the amendment
which

04:22:00.750 --> 04:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:22:04.269 --> 04:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
removes uh part two from the Bill thank
 
04:22:08.550 --> 04:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair for indulging
 
04:22:14.309 --> 04:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:18.149 --> 04:22:18.159 align:start position:0%

representative wer know that I am on and
 
04:22:29.750 --> 04:22:29.760 align:start position:0%

you yes representative mlan yeah um I'm

representative Smith's Amendment uh it's
 
04:22:41.990 --> 04:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
a it's a tough call for me because I'm
 
04:22:44.630 --> 04:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
not a fan of fraud uh especially in
 
04:22:47.030 --> 04:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
programs like this
 
04:22:47.040 --> 04:22:49.109 align:start position:0%
programs like this
where

04:22:49.109 --> 04:22:49.119 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:22:53.189 --> 04:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
oh oh are we recording again are so and
 
04:22:55.590 --> 04:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
so and I don't want people to perceive
 
04:22:58.790 --> 04:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
that that I I favor fraud but I think
 
04:23:00.990 --> 04:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
that you know where there's an
 
04:23:04.189 --> 04:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the Departments to be in
 
04:23:06.630 --> 04:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
error and especially in the the middle
 
04:23:09.910 --> 04:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
of a pandemic um where I know uh I've
 
04:23:12.309 --> 04:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
had calls from multiple constituents
 
04:23:14.550 --> 04:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
including a disabled veteran where
 
04:23:17.269 --> 04:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
they've been caught up in a whole bunch
 
04:23:18.950 --> 04:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
of administrative errors and I've had to
 
04:23:20.429 --> 04:23:20.439 align:start position:0%
speak to department heads and
 
04:23:23.790 --> 04:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I I really think um that
 
04:23:26.429 --> 04:23:26.439 align:start position:0%
this is is not the time uh to be doing
 
04:23:28.510 --> 04:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
it in the case of true fraud as
 
04:23:30.469 --> 04:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
representative Smith said there are
 
04:23:33.389 --> 04:23:33.399 align:start position:0%
other tools available and so we need to
 
04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
be pursuing fraud we have to hold people
 
04:23:37.550 --> 04:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
accountable but we have to temper that
 
04:23:38.790 --> 04:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
accountability with a little bit of
 
04:23:41.910 --> 04:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
mercy and so I'm going to be supporting
 
04:23:41.920 --> 04:23:43.670 align:start position:0%
mercy and so I'm going to be supporting
her

04:23:43.670 --> 04:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
her
 
04:23:46.429 --> 04:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment any other
 
04:23:49.710 --> 04:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
discussion yes representative Langley
 
04:23:52.429 --> 04:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I too would support
 
04:23:55.550 --> 04:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative Smith's Amendment and
 
04:23:57.910 --> 04:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
um Wanted to express my concern with the
 
04:24:01.910 --> 04:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
Department's um uh efforts to recoup
 
04:24:04.149 --> 04:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
money uh from people as they begin to
 
04:24:06.269 --> 04:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
stabilize their lives and become
 
04:24:09.109 --> 04:24:09.119 align:start position:0%
productive citizens um as representative
 
04:24:12.469 --> 04:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
mlan just stated I I also do not support
 
04:24:14.590 --> 04:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
fraud but when you look at the numbers
 
04:24:17.269 --> 04:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
that were provided by the department the
 
04:24:20.070 --> 04:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
number uh the department recouped less
 
04:24:23.550 --> 04:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
than what it cost them to uh investigate
 
04:24:26.469 --> 04:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
um the people that were alleged to have
 
04:24:28.870 --> 04:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
committed the fraud so I think it the
 
04:24:32.710 --> 04:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
numbers spoke for themselves thank
 
04:24:35.149 --> 04:24:35.159 align:start position:0%

pass okay the amendment has passed is
 
04:27:00.389 --> 04:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
and I guess we are open to at this point
 
04:27:02.189 --> 04:27:02.199 align:start position:0%
in time I guess since it removes that
 
04:27:04.910 --> 04:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
section there's no need for further
 
04:27:07.910 --> 04:27:07.920 align:start position:0%

uh

04:28:32.389 --> 04:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:34.790 --> 04:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
does somebody want to
 
04:28:34.800 --> 04:28:44.070 align:start position:0%
does somebody want to
uh

04:28:44.070 --> 04:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:46.550 --> 04:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
Mr could I ask a question of the chair
 
04:28:51.389 --> 04:28:51.399 align:start position:0%
yes you may um Mr chair um if there is
 
04:28:56.269 --> 04:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
no amendment to any particular section
 
04:28:59.790 --> 04:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
um I would think that we need to vote on
 
04:29:02.990 --> 04:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
each section we only need to vote on the
 
04:29:06.750 --> 04:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
Amendments and then at the end vote on
 
04:29:11.149 --> 04:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
the entire bill so we
 
04:29:15.269 --> 04:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
um uh the first section we're waiting
 
04:29:18.309 --> 04:29:18.319 align:start position:0%
now to convert a bill from Senate to
 
04:29:20.910 --> 04:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
house the second we've just eliminated
 
04:29:23.910 --> 04:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
the third if they no amendments um we
 
04:29:27.670 --> 04:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
would just go on to the fourth section
 
04:29:29.790 --> 04:29:29.800 align:start position:0%
do you see it differently no I think
 
04:29:32.269 --> 04:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
you're right as usual I think we're just
 
04:29:34.670 --> 04:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
waiting to see if representative wer had
 
04:29:38.510 --> 04:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:38.520 --> 04:29:41.389 align:start position:0%
 
am

04:29:41.389 --> 04:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:45.590 --> 04:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:48.349 --> 04:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
unnecessary well if you can get an
 
04:29:50.469 --> 04:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
amendment before we're finished
 
04:29:52.469 --> 04:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
executing here today then that would be
 
04:29:55.710 --> 04:29:55.720 align:start position:0%
fine but otherwise we'll be moving
 
04:29:58.830 --> 04:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
on part four allowing judicial referees
 
04:30:00.750 --> 04:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
to issue orders and non-contested
 
04:30:00.760 --> 04:30:04.030 align:start position:0%

04:30:16.710 --> 04:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
that see none part five permitting a
 
04:30:18.269 --> 04:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court Justice to sit as a
 
04:30:27.070 --> 04:30:27.080 align:start position:0%

04:30:34.640 --> 04:30:43.109 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

04:30:43.109 --> 04:30:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:43.119 --> 04:30:44.349 align:start position:0%
 
part

04:30:44.349 --> 04:30:44.359 align:start position:0%
part
 
04:30:47.030 --> 04:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
six relative to payment of cost for
 
04:30:53.590 --> 04:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:59.790 --> 04:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:01.990 --> 04:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
that seeing
 
04:31:05.149 --> 04:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
none part seven requiring a penalty
 
04:31:07.990 --> 04:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
assessment on
 
04:31:09.950 --> 04:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
violations chairman I do have an
 
04:31:12.429 --> 04:31:12.439 align:start position:0%
amendment for that
 
04:31:15.109 --> 04:31:15.119 align:start position:0%
one and I would like to
 
04:31:20.349 --> 04:31:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:23.630 --> 04:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
two2 and and Mr chair I would second
 
04:31:23.640 --> 04:31:24.990 align:start position:0%
two2 and and Mr chair I would second
that

04:31:24.990 --> 04:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:31:27.830 --> 04:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment and what was that Amendment
 
04:31:31.109 --> 04:31:31.119 align:start position:0%
again so relative to penalty assessments
 
04:31:33.309 --> 04:31:33.319 align:start position:0%
on violations yeah what was the
 
04:31:36.469 --> 04:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
amendment number oh I'm sorry
 
04:31:36.479 --> 04:31:40.710 align:start position:0%
amendment number oh I'm sorry
1272

04:31:40.710 --> 04:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:45.670 --> 04:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
H and so that was moov by representative
 
04:31:48.269 --> 04:31:48.279 align:start position:0%

04:31:48.279 --> 04:31:50.149 align:start position:0%

04:31:50.149 --> 04:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
04:31:52.670 --> 04:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
correct and just to speak very briefly
 
04:31:54.109 --> 04:31:54.119 align:start position:0%
on this
 
04:31:57.830 --> 04:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
um there is a bit of confusion I guess
 
04:32:01.590 --> 04:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh apparently assessments are already uh
 
04:32:04.910 --> 04:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
applied to violations U but the law does
 
04:32:07.109 --> 04:32:07.119 align:start position:0%
not NE necessarily provide for it I'm
 
04:32:08.990 --> 04:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
not sure how that happens but I don't
 
04:32:12.670 --> 04:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
want to be instituting a section into
 
04:32:16.030 --> 04:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
the statute to correct uh something
 
04:32:17.990 --> 04:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's perhaps not done right I'm not
 
04:32:21.830 --> 04:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:28.030 --> 04:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:30.950 --> 04:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
amendment seeing none I think Mr clerk
 
04:32:33.670 --> 04:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:41.550 --> 04:32:41.560 align:start position:0%

representative

04:35:02.510 --> 04:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:35:07.189 --> 04:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
syvia yes uh thank you Mr chairman um in
 
04:35:10.629 --> 04:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
in looking at this uh we have a statute
 
04:35:13.390 --> 04:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
that there are two parts to it that
 
04:35:16.070 --> 04:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
might be a problem and I believe uh
 
04:35:18.070 --> 04:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative Smith was going to
 
04:35:21.830 --> 04:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
address part of it being a 28a issue of
 
04:35:24.109 --> 04:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
a mandate for U
 
04:35:27.750 --> 04:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities but the more troubling
 
04:35:30.551 --> 04:35:30.561 align:start position:0%
aspect I guess is that this is a bill
 
04:35:33.910 --> 04:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
with no actual mandate uh while it says
 
04:35:36.189 --> 04:35:36.199 align:start position:0%
it needs to be done and it suggests
 
04:35:37.629 --> 04:35:37.639 align:start position:0%
things should be done there is certainly
 
04:35:41.750 --> 04:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
no uh penalty for a violation of it so
 
04:35:43.551 --> 04:35:43.561 align:start position:0%
essentially this turns into putting a
 
04:35:46.551 --> 04:35:46.561 align:start position:0%
suggestion into statute and I think um
 
04:35:49.551 --> 04:35:49.561 align:start position:0%
our statutes are full of things that
 
04:35:53.029 --> 04:35:53.039 align:start position:0%
actually um tend to be ignored already
 
04:35:55.629 --> 04:35:55.639 align:start position:0%
so uh I don't think this is necessary
 
04:35:57.949 --> 04:35:57.959 align:start position:0%
and therefore I would just assum have it
 
04:36:02.590 --> 04:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:12.910 --> 04:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:15.349 --> 04:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
cler I think you call the RO on
 
04:36:15.359 --> 04:36:17.949 align:start position:0%
cler I think you call the RO on

04:37:52.470 --> 04:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
yes um Mr chair um I wasn't called on
 
04:37:55.590 --> 04:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:57.709 --> 04:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
vote did you call Representative
 
04:38:02.349 --> 04:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:06.310 --> 04:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
you I don't remember voting so um if I
 
04:38:10.349 --> 04:38:10.359 align:start position:0%
if I forgot about me voting I vote Yes
 
04:38:16.029 --> 04:38:16.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:21.789 --> 04:38:21.799 align:start position:0%
you so the motion uh fails it's 10 to
 
04:38:31.150 --> 04:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:33.910 --> 04:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
motion is there another
 
04:38:33.920 --> 04:38:36.769 align:start position:0%
motion is there another
amendment

04:38:36.769 --> 04:38:36.779 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:38:36.779 --> 04:38:39.109 align:start position:0%
amendment
[Applause]

04:38:39.109 --> 04:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
04:38:41.109 --> 04:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
now ordinarily i' think i' know what to
 
04:38:42.670 --> 04:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
do if this was a separate bill but I'm
 
04:38:44.590 --> 04:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
not exactly sure what to do if it's a
 
04:38:47.789 --> 04:38:47.799 align:start position:0%
part so I guess it just stays in the way
 
04:38:53.551 --> 04:38:53.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:57.349 --> 04:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
um and part nine relative to emergency
 
04:39:03.830 --> 04:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:03.840 --> 04:39:08.910 align:start position:0%
 
data

04:39:08.910 --> 04:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:13.551 --> 04:39:13.561 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes um I did have an amendment
 
04:39:16.670 --> 04:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
um on part nine but it also addresses
 
04:39:19.670 --> 04:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
part 10
 
04:39:25.470 --> 04:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
so I so I'll I'll offer it uh uh
 
04:39:29.551 --> 04:39:29.561 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1223
 
04:39:35.189 --> 04:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
H um and so what amendment 1223 does
 
04:39:38.830 --> 04:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
basically is it takes both part nine and
 
04:39:43.470 --> 04:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
part 10 out of the uh out of the bill
 
04:39:47.310 --> 04:39:47.320 align:start position:0%
part 10 nobody really came at all to
 
04:39:51.150 --> 04:39:51.160 align:start position:0%
testify on part 10 um so I'm not sure
 
04:39:53.390 --> 04:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
that I have a full understanding of what
 
04:39:58.030 --> 04:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
it's trying to do um part nine was uh
 
04:40:01.868 --> 04:40:01.878 align:start position:0%
the the sharing of uh Medical Data you
 
04:40:05.430 --> 04:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
know for data Gathering and research and
 
04:40:07.948 --> 04:40:07.958 align:start position:0%
while that may be well-intentioned and
 
04:40:11.750 --> 04:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
it may be to the good um
 
04:40:15.390 --> 04:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
there's authorization within that part
 
04:40:17.990 --> 04:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill that would allow for the
 
04:40:21.750 --> 04:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
sharing of non-anonymized data as well
 
04:40:25.708 --> 04:40:25.718 align:start position:0%
as aggregate data and I I it does have a
 
04:40:28.550 --> 04:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
privacy Council set up but how that
 
04:40:30.390 --> 04:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
would operate and what rules it would
 
04:40:32.628 --> 04:40:32.638 align:start position:0%
operate under I don't really think we
 
04:40:35.550 --> 04:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
really had the opportunity to V any of
 
04:40:38.910 --> 04:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
that and so while there may be Merit to
 
04:40:41.270 --> 04:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
it I don't think you know buried an an
 
04:40:44.390 --> 04:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
omous bill is where this should be it
 
04:40:48.150 --> 04:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
should have its own uh airing in the
 
04:40:51.750 --> 04:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
light of day so um Amendment one 223
 
04:40:54.590 --> 04:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
basically removes both those parts from
 
04:40:54.600 --> 04:40:58.110 align:start position:0%
basically removes both those parts from
the

04:40:58.110 --> 04:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:02.150 --> 04:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
bill second if you need it second uh so
 
04:41:03.990 --> 04:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's moved by representative mlan
 
04:41:05.990 --> 04:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
seconded by represented
 
04:41:08.868 --> 04:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
Sylvia basically removing Parts nine and
 
04:41:12.868 --> 04:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
parts 10 from Senate Bill
 
04:41:16.550 --> 04:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
143 is there any other discussion I'd
 
04:41:19.550 --> 04:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
like to offer uh something if I may you
 
04:41:22.868 --> 04:41:22.878 align:start position:0%
sure can uh so I I'm particularly
 
04:41:25.628 --> 04:41:25.638 align:start position:0%
troubled by this uh section nine and the
 
04:41:28.430 --> 04:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh the data that's going to be
 
04:41:32.310 --> 04:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
collected um find it very
 
04:41:35.830 --> 04:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
troubling data is becoming
 
04:41:40.910 --> 04:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh big business and uh the people's
 
04:41:44.430 --> 04:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
privacy is is affected by this so I
 
04:41:47.910 --> 04:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
would say our our
 
04:41:50.830 --> 04:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution and our right to privacy is
 
04:41:53.708 --> 04:41:53.718 align:start position:0%
uh important and this bill is less
 
04:41:59.948 --> 04:41:59.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:02.110 --> 04:42:02.120 align:start position:0%
it any
 
04:42:08.270 --> 04:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:10.708 --> 04:42:10.718 align:start position:0%

call the
 
04:42:15.830 --> 04:42:15.840 align:start position:0%

vote total again please 18
 
04:49:12.750 --> 04:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
to2 thank
 
04:49:15.830 --> 04:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I was wondering if it might
 
04:49:18.070 --> 04:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
be possible for us to recess just for a
 
04:49:19.628 --> 04:49:19.638 align:start position:0%
little bit I know that we have a couple
 
04:49:21.708 --> 04:49:21.718 align:start position:0%
amendments that we sent out to be
 
04:49:25.070 --> 04:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
converted I know that you had one on 143
 
04:49:27.390 --> 04:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
and based on that ruling I realized I
 
04:49:29.548 --> 04:49:29.558 align:start position:0%
had to have another uh Amendment from
 
04:49:32.110 --> 04:49:32.120 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson's relative to 134
 
04:49:34.628 --> 04:49:34.638 align:start position:0%
converted over so I just like to have
 
04:49:37.230 --> 04:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to get those converted
 
04:49:42.070 --> 04:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:45.910 --> 04:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
resume so uh what we'll do is um I think
 
04:49:47.628 --> 04:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
we if we could
 
04:49:50.470 --> 04:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
recess uh
 
04:49:54.150 --> 04:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
till give us let's say if we recess to
 
04:49:56.750 --> 04:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
quarter past
 
04:49:56.760 --> 04:49:58.270 align:start position:0%
quarter past
two

04:49:58.270 --> 04:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:50:02.390 --> 04:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
okay uh could I suggest an alternative I
 
04:50:04.070 --> 04:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you're interested in
 
04:50:09.150 --> 04:50:09.160 align:start position:0%
that is um that we
 
04:50:11.510 --> 04:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
um move
 
04:50:14.868 --> 04:50:14.878 align:start position:0%
on we we do not close the executive
 
04:50:19.708 --> 04:50:19.718 align:start position:0%
session on on this um but we move on to
 
04:50:24.270 --> 04:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
the executive session on the next bill
 
04:50:27.430 --> 04:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
um or does that make things
 
04:50:29.708 --> 04:50:29.718 align:start position:0%
confusing I think it it makes it
 
04:50:32.270 --> 04:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
confusing for me okay oh no no I don't
 
04:50:34.868 --> 04:50:34.878 align:start position:0%
want to do that I would never do that
 
04:50:38.190 --> 04:50:38.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair Mr chair might I
 
04:50:40.788 --> 04:50:40.798 align:start position:0%
inquire we only have one section
 
04:50:43.510 --> 04:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
obviously left in
 
04:50:48.110 --> 04:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
143 and I know we were waiting for a uh
 
04:50:52.628 --> 04:50:52.638 align:start position:0%
um a repaired Amendment uh has have you
 
04:50:54.430 --> 04:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
received that I mean the only change is
 
04:50:57.030 --> 04:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
from an S to an H have you received that
 
04:50:57.040 --> 04:50:59.510 align:start position:0%
from an S to an H have you received that
yet

04:50:59.510 --> 04:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
yet
 
04:51:02.948 --> 04:51:02.958 align:start position:0%
no and also representative Burch um
 
04:51:04.470 --> 04:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
based on that rule there was an
 
04:51:06.670 --> 04:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
amendment from Senator Carson on 134
 
04:51:09.030 --> 04:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with part one that I had to have
 
04:51:12.670 --> 04:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
converted as well so before we go 134
 
04:51:14.788 --> 04:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
I'd like that right I was just trying to
 
04:51:16.830 --> 04:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
figure out if we could just finish 143
 
04:51:19.788 --> 04:51:19.798 align:start position:0%
at this point um also that's a long
 
04:51:24.190 --> 04:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
delay and I know that the house Dems are
 
04:51:26.590 --> 04:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
having a caucus which we will
 
04:51:29.070 --> 04:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly those of us here miss a good
 
04:51:30.910 --> 04:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
chunk of but I'd like to catch a little
 
04:51:34.030 --> 04:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
bit of it and so maybe if the would
 
04:51:36.430 --> 04:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
shorten that uh period of time a little
 
04:51:41.350 --> 04:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
bit the court excuse me the
 
04:51:58.510 --> 04:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:00.948 --> 04:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
habits the
 
04:52:03.470 --> 04:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh I need I need do need a little bit of
 
04:52:03.480 --> 04:52:04.830 align:start position:0%
uh I need I need do need a little bit of
time

04:52:04.830 --> 04:52:04.840 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:52:06.470 --> 04:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
um I
 
04:52:08.830 --> 04:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
Al to
 
04:52:12.150 --> 04:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh to get those amendments here if if
 
04:52:14.628 --> 04:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't object to

a senate Amendment but obviously you're

ruling on
 
04:57:51.390 --> 04:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
143 as soon as you did that I said oh

well that's going to have implications
 
04:57:55.628 --> 04:57:55.638 align:start position:0%
on 134 as well so that'll have to be
 
04:57:55.638 --> 04:57:58.110 align:start position:0%
on 134 as well so that'll have to be
tightened

section one as well and the issue there
 
05:04:29.470 --> 05:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
was it was another amendment that had
 
05:04:32.310 --> 05:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
been prepared by Senator Carson and we
 
05:04:36.510 --> 05:04:36.520 align:start position:0%

my

05:06:27.590 --> 05:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:30.390 --> 05:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
yes my
 
05:06:43.070 --> 05:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:46.548 --> 05:06:46.558 align:start position:0%
so the amendment went through 4 I I'm
 
05:06:48.070 --> 05:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
expecting that all the Judiciary
 
05:06:49.830 --> 05:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
Committee members have
 
05:06:54.990 --> 05:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
it because sent by email about six days
 
05:06:59.110 --> 05:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
ago uh and what it does is it replaces
 
05:07:01.270 --> 05:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
the definition of electronic signature
 
05:07:03.270 --> 05:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
in two parts to the
 
05:07:08.548 --> 05:07:08.558 align:start position:0%
built both in part two section three and
 
05:07:12.070 --> 05:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
in part two section
 
05:07:14.628 --> 05:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
10 and in each
 
05:07:18.628 --> 05:07:18.638 align:start position:0%
place it changes the definition from the
 
05:07:21.470 --> 05:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
quite broad vague definition that's in
 
05:07:25.590 --> 05:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
it to the definition that's used by the
 
05:07:28.310 --> 05:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
FDIC which was suggested to us by the
 
05:07:28.320 --> 05:07:30.190 align:start position:0%
FDIC which was suggested to us by the
registry

05:07:30.190 --> 05:07:30.200 align:start position:0%
registry
 
05:07:32.670 --> 05:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
deeds and that was there only objection
 
05:07:35.230 --> 05:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
to this bill which was actually I know
 
05:07:37.270 --> 05:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
the only
 
05:07:39.390 --> 05:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
objection that we really got the
 
05:07:39.400 --> 05:07:40.510 align:start position:0%
objection that we really got the
registry

05:07:40.510 --> 05:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
registry
 
05:07:43.750 --> 05:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
ofs so that's what the amendment does
 
05:07:45.430 --> 05:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
just changes the definition of
 
05:07:45.440 --> 05:07:53.150 align:start position:0%
just changes the definition of
electronic

05:07:53.150 --> 05:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:55.070 --> 05:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
signature first of all was there a
 
05:07:58.310 --> 05:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
second to representative W's
 
05:08:01.350 --> 05:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
motion I'll second second it by
 
05:08:01.360 --> 05:08:05.030 align:start position:0%
motion I'll second second it by
represent

05:08:05.030 --> 05:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:05.040 --> 05:08:17.230 align:start position:0%
 
ready

05:08:17.230 --> 05:08:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:21.390 --> 05:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:23.948 --> 05:08:23.958 align:start position:0%
Loreno thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:08:25.750 --> 05:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
U representative welper for taking my
 
05:08:31.110 --> 05:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
question I'm trying to figure out um how
 
05:08:33.708 --> 05:08:33.718 align:start position:0%
the electronic signature becomes
 
05:08:38.548 --> 05:08:38.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:42.510 --> 05:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
instance um and the answer
 
05:08:45.670 --> 05:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
is over my
 
05:08:48.590 --> 05:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
head the answer I have is the what the
 
05:08:50.470 --> 05:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
words you see in front of you apparently
 
05:08:55.470 --> 05:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
this is a private key trans uh uh
 
05:08:58.350 --> 05:08:58.360 align:start position:0%
encryption in which in which place only
 
05:09:01.670 --> 05:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
one person has that private key and has
 
05:09:03.510 --> 05:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
to give it anybody else that wants to
 
05:09:06.230 --> 05:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
open I don't exactly understand
 
05:09:09.430 --> 05:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
this what I do know about it is that as
 
05:09:12.830 --> 05:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
was explained to us by uh rean from the
 
05:09:15.830 --> 05:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
Mart County
 
05:09:19.310 --> 05:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
registry that the definition of
 
05:09:22.430 --> 05:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
electronic signature was a big problem
 
05:09:24.390 --> 05:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
during mortgage crisis and caused a lot
 
05:09:27.030 --> 05:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
of the problems that they had and that a
 
05:09:29.670 --> 05:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
result of that the
 
05:09:34.230 --> 05:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
FDIC has changed its definition to
 
05:09:36.868 --> 05:09:36.878 align:start position:0%
this I know two things about that one
 
05:09:40.230 --> 05:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
this does work because it is in
 
05:09:46.590 --> 05:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
use and two it it fixes the only problem
 
05:09:49.788 --> 05:09:49.798 align:start position:0%
that was identified with this language
 
05:09:53.628 --> 05:09:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:00.548 --> 05:10:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:04.990 --> 05:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:06.910 --> 05:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
I apologize I just want to I'm gotten a
 
05:10:09.190 --> 05:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
little bit confused so what is the
 
05:10:11.030 --> 05:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
number of the amendment that we are
 
05:10:12.910 --> 05:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
considering right
 
05:10:17.948 --> 05:10:17.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:22.390 --> 05:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
Z if you just so you'll
 
05:10:26.548 --> 05:10:26.558 align:start position:0%
know and that's not I'm I'm sorry May is
 
05:10:28.310 --> 05:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
that one of the new ones or that's an
 
05:10:30.990 --> 05:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
old one that's is that all new because
 
05:10:34.230 --> 05:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
none have been introduced but uh I sent
 
05:10:39.670 --> 05:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:43.190 --> 05:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:46.708 --> 05:10:46.718 align:start position:0%
30th thank you so you should have it in
 
05:10:46.718 --> 05:10:47.708 align:start position:0%
30th thank you so you should have it in
your

05:10:47.708 --> 05:10:47.718 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:10:54.070 --> 05:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:56.990 --> 05:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
have no this is the house oh okay all
 
05:10:59.350 --> 05:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
right so it's not I'm okay I just was
 
05:11:00.830 --> 05:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
clarifying it wasn't one of the new ones
 
05:11:03.470 --> 05:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
that was just drafted thank you we're on
 
05:11:05.628 --> 05:11:05.638 align:start position:0%
a different
 
05:11:05.638 --> 05:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
a different
now

05:11:06.920 --> 05:11:06.930 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:11:06.930 --> 05:11:08.590 align:start position:0%
now
[Music]

05:11:08.590 --> 05:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:11:12.070 --> 05:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
no no not
 
05:11:15.990 --> 05:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
new yes uh representative
 
05:11:20.350 --> 05:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
bur uh thank you uh and thank you
 
05:11:22.070 --> 05:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question I
 
05:11:26.110 --> 05:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
gather this is a uh a public key private
 
05:11:29.070 --> 05:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
key encryption system which I'm
 
05:11:31.350 --> 05:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
wondering whether is kind of an overload
 
05:11:34.670 --> 05:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
for you know what a notary needs to go
 
05:11:36.868 --> 05:11:36.878 align:start position:0%
through and I'm wondering how this would
 
05:11:40.030 --> 05:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
impact uh notarization for people who
 
05:11:45.830 --> 05:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
don't have uh um either the electronic
 
05:11:50.430 --> 05:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge to do this uh or an ability to
 
05:11:54.948 --> 05:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
keep this electronic data uh secret yet
 
05:11:58.990 --> 05:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
available over considerable periods of
 
05:11:59.000 --> 05:12:00.868 align:start position:0%
available over considerable periods of
time

05:12:00.868 --> 05:12:00.878 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:12:03.948 --> 05:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
so it's my expectation that everybody
 
05:12:06.470 --> 05:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
that uses this would just buy software
 
05:12:06.480 --> 05:12:12.590 align:start position:0%
that uses this would just buy software
that

05:12:12.590 --> 05:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:21.030 --> 05:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:25.350 --> 05:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:27.868 --> 05:12:27.878 align:start position:0%
muted representative Simpson sorry I was
 
05:12:29.150 --> 05:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
looking sorry I was looking at the
 
05:12:31.510 --> 05:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
amendment um and didn't realize I was
 
05:12:31.520 --> 05:12:32.830 align:start position:0%
amendment um and didn't realize I was
muted

05:12:32.830 --> 05:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
muted
 
05:12:35.830 --> 05:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
um sorry forgive me for not figuring
 
05:12:37.910 --> 05:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
this out myself but I have a question
 
05:12:40.548 --> 05:12:40.558 align:start position:0%
about the um when I'm reading the
 
05:12:43.070 --> 05:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
amendment does it just replace a
 
05:12:45.310 --> 05:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
definition or does it replace the entire
 
05:12:48.868 --> 05:12:48.878 align:start position:0%
section 10 no no just a definition okay
 
05:12:48.878 --> 05:12:50.788 align:start position:0%
section 10 no no just a definition okay
great

05:12:50.788 --> 05:12:50.798 align:start position:0%
great
 
05:12:56.990 --> 05:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:02.110 --> 05:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
MC um so I do have concerns um that but
 
05:13:03.510 --> 05:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
I I'm sorry I need to look at the
 
05:13:05.030 --> 05:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
current law that that's not what
 
05:13:06.830 --> 05:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
electronic signature means to me I've
 
05:13:08.628 --> 05:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
been electronic filing some things with
 
05:13:11.190 --> 05:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch but I'm I I just
 
05:13:14.990 --> 05:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
need to clarify so I won't I let me
 
05:13:15.000 --> 05:13:18.150 align:start position:0%
need to clarify so I won't I let me
thank

05:13:18.150 --> 05:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:21.750 --> 05:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
you I mean do you chair have a is that
 
05:13:23.910 --> 05:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
what electronic s signature means to you
 
05:13:25.868 --> 05:13:25.878 align:start position:0%
is that or have you been using I I don't
 
05:13:29.548 --> 05:13:29.558 align:start position:0%
mean to put you on the spot I'm just
 
05:13:33.430 --> 05:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
curious uh in the the uses that I'm
 
05:13:36.270 --> 05:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
currently involved with they aren't as
 
05:13:39.830 --> 05:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
technical as that and in terms of
 
05:13:39.840 --> 05:13:41.270 align:start position:0%
technical as that and in terms of
encryption

05:13:41.270 --> 05:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
encryption
 
05:13:43.948 --> 05:13:43.958 align:start position:0%
so that's it's new to
 
05:13:46.430 --> 05:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
me thank you I think that's how I'm
 
05:13:49.868 --> 05:13:49.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:53.430 --> 05:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
you represent Horgan um yes thank you
 
05:13:56.750 --> 05:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
very much um I mean my concern is well
 
05:13:58.350 --> 05:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
first of all I think this wasn't the
 
05:14:00.390 --> 05:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
registers of deed only objection to the
 
05:14:02.390 --> 05:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
wording of the bill so I think
 
05:14:06.030 --> 05:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
we um they you there were I mean there
 
05:14:08.590 --> 05:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
were I'm also like not exactly
 
05:14:10.548 --> 05:14:10.558 align:start position:0%
encryption key is an encryption keys I'm
 
05:14:12.110 --> 05:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
not exactly sure how that's the same
 
05:14:14.270 --> 05:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
thing as an electronic signature so I
 
05:14:16.548 --> 05:14:16.558 align:start position:0%
feel like even though I'm not a lawyer
 
05:14:18.230 --> 05:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
this is something I feel like
 
05:14:21.910 --> 05:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
I seems to me I either either this is
 
05:14:24.310 --> 05:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
like not a good substitute for the
 
05:14:26.070 --> 05:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
language on electronic signature or
 
05:14:27.910 --> 05:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a hole of my knowledge so
 
05:14:30.350 --> 05:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
maybe want maybe R wber can clarify a
 
05:14:32.670 --> 05:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
little bit more about how an encryption
 
05:14:35.310 --> 05:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
key is the same thing as an electronic
 
05:14:37.708 --> 05:14:37.718 align:start position:0%
signature because iide of the signature
 
05:14:41.310 --> 05:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
just a remark that tells you verify
 
05:14:43.230 --> 05:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
tells you who the person was who who
 
05:14:46.070 --> 05:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
signed it so I I just don't I just don't
 
05:14:49.948 --> 05:14:49.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:53.750 --> 05:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
don't but maybe you can enlighten
 
05:14:57.470 --> 05:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
me I've had correspondence with the
 
05:14:59.430 --> 05:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
registers of deeds and in particularly
 
05:15:01.150 --> 05:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
the president of the register of deeds
 
05:15:01.160 --> 05:15:02.430 align:start position:0%
the president of the register of deeds
associate

05:15:02.430 --> 05:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
associate
 
05:15:06.548 --> 05:15:06.558 align:start position:0%
a her her concern wasn't with the
 
05:15:09.230 --> 05:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
electronic signature as much as it
 
05:15:13.590 --> 05:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
was uh the ability to have signatures on
 
05:15:16.470 --> 05:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
documents such as plats and maps and
 
05:15:20.670 --> 05:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
surveys that uh and that was raised that
 
05:15:23.590 --> 05:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
day and subsequently raised and they
 
05:15:25.110 --> 05:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
actually wrote a letter to us which I
 
05:15:27.470 --> 05:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
think we all reive saying that they
 
05:15:30.270 --> 05:15:30.280 align:start position:0%
objected to Part 10 of the bill but I've
 
05:15:32.590 --> 05:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
since heard from them and and I I have
 
05:15:35.110 --> 05:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
an amendment as well which corrects that
 
05:15:36.868 --> 05:15:36.878 align:start position:0%
part which they're in agreement with and
 
05:15:39.310 --> 05:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
indicated that if that Amendment passed
 
05:15:48.628 --> 05:15:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:50.910 --> 05:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
satisfied if I could just ask uh
 
05:15:50.920 --> 05:15:52.070 align:start position:0%
satisfied if I could just ask uh
representative

05:15:52.070 --> 05:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:15:55.190 --> 05:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
wer the the the
 
05:15:58.510 --> 05:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
FDIC uh the amendment that you have was
 
05:16:00.510 --> 05:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
that something that was given to you by
 
05:16:03.510 --> 05:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
the registers is something that they
 
05:16:03.520 --> 05:16:09.708 align:start position:0%
the registers is something that they
wanted

05:16:09.708 --> 05:16:09.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:12.150 --> 05:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
yes and she's particularly concerned
 
05:16:30.470 --> 05:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:30.480 --> 05:16:49.830 align:start position:0%
 
of

05:16:49.830 --> 05:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:54.070 --> 05:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:56.750 --> 05:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
Beth well I hadn't lowered my hand but I
 
05:16:58.390 --> 05:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
I just was doing a little bit of
 
05:17:01.110 --> 05:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
research um I don't this definition I
 
05:17:02.788 --> 05:17:02.798 align:start position:0%
don't know where the language come came
 
05:17:06.230 --> 05:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
from but I it's it's not one that I see
 
05:17:08.390 --> 05:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's used typically in some of the
 
05:17:10.670 --> 05:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
like electronic systems that I've been
 
05:17:13.350 --> 05:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
using frequently but I I appreciate the
 
05:17:13.360 --> 05:17:15.948 align:start position:0%
using frequently but I I appreciate the
concern

05:17:15.948 --> 05:17:15.958 align:start position:0%
concern
 
05:17:19.830 --> 05:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:23.270 --> 05:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
it any other discussion on the amendment
 
05:17:30.390 --> 05:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:30.400 --> 05:17:32.230 align:start position:0%
 
124

05:17:32.230 --> 05:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
124
 
05:17:33.830 --> 05:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
I guess the question is do you feel
 
05:17:35.628 --> 05:17:35.638 align:start position:0%
comfortable I I don't understand it is
 
05:17:37.030 --> 05:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
what it comes down to and I guess the
 
05:17:39.030 --> 05:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
question is do I feel comfortable voting
 
05:17:49.868 --> 05:17:49.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:55.070 --> 05:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:00.310 --> 05:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:00.320 --> 05:18:02.110 align:start position:0%
 
muted

05:18:02.110 --> 05:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
muted
 
05:18:03.708 --> 05:18:03.718 align:start position:0%
for the group I'd like to offer sort of
 
05:18:07.628 --> 05:18:07.638 align:start position:0%
a simple explanation of encryption um so
 
05:18:09.830 --> 05:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
encryption would be
 
05:18:14.750 --> 05:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
the partty a agrees to exchange a
 
05:18:17.750 --> 05:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
document with partty two
 
05:18:21.150 --> 05:18:21.160 align:start position:0%
and both have sort of like a
 
05:18:24.150 --> 05:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
passcode to get into the document so
 
05:18:28.150 --> 05:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
that if I if I sign let's say a form um
 
05:18:31.190 --> 05:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
they'll be like it will be scrambled by
 
05:18:35.030 --> 05:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
the the system and each party has a key
 
05:18:38.110 --> 05:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
that will unscramble the um the
 
05:18:40.150 --> 05:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
information that's it it's like having a
 
05:18:41.910 --> 05:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
password to someone's signature that's
 
05:18:44.310 --> 05:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
only shared by two P two people the
 
05:18:46.470 --> 05:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
party that's the simplest I could I
 
05:18:48.230 --> 05:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
could make
 
05:18:53.350 --> 05:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:53.360 --> 05:18:56.350 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

05:18:56.350 --> 05:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:00.240 --> 05:19:03.670 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

05:19:03.670 --> 05:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:08.470 --> 05:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
so I yeah so I I I appreciate my
 
05:19:10.270 --> 05:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
distinguished colleague from uh new
 
05:19:13.350 --> 05:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
markets explanation I guess I I and I
 
05:19:15.030 --> 05:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate that but what I don't
 
05:19:17.310 --> 05:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
understand what I'm concerned about is
 
05:19:21.430 --> 05:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
having each party having the software to
 
05:19:23.230 --> 05:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
do the encryption and communicate with
 
05:19:25.990 --> 05:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
each other and it seems like what we're
 
05:19:27.948 --> 05:19:27.958 align:start position:0%
you know we're talking about a broader
 
05:19:29.708 --> 05:19:29.718 align:start position:0%
Network where everyone's not going to
 
05:19:31.548 --> 05:19:31.558 align:start position:0%
have that so I won't be able ble to
 
05:19:33.510 --> 05:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
support the amendment
 
05:19:37.430 --> 05:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:41.628 --> 05:19:41.638 align:start position:0%
you is if I could just ask question
 
05:19:44.788 --> 05:19:44.798 align:start position:0%
representative wer does that your
 
05:19:47.708 --> 05:19:47.718 align:start position:0%
Amendment apply to the whole bill or
 
05:19:52.150 --> 05:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
simply to the recordable documents
 
05:19:54.590 --> 05:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
part and the reason I asked that is
 
05:19:57.150 --> 05:19:57.160 align:start position:0%
because estate planning attorneys are
 
05:20:00.150 --> 05:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
using the remote
 
05:20:03.628 --> 05:20:03.638 align:start position:0%
notorized I wouldn't want them to put
 
05:20:05.910 --> 05:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
them out of business by requiring them
 
05:20:10.470 --> 05:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:15.670 --> 05:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
do so it does both parts of the
 
05:20:19.230 --> 05:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
bill chance the definition in both in
 
05:20:27.430 --> 05:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:30.910 --> 05:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
10 any other question represent m f is
 
05:20:36.628 --> 05:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:39.510 --> 05:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
no you ready to vote
 
05:20:42.990 --> 05:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
so by yep so just for everybody's
 
05:20:45.830 --> 05:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
information I'm at the fdic.gov
 
05:20:45.840 --> 05:20:49.030 align:start position:0%
information I'm at the fdic.gov
regulations

05:20:49.030 --> 05:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:51.628 --> 05:20:51.638 align:start position:0%
information Tech p in
 
05:20:54.750 --> 05:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
HML it says signing and receiving
 
05:20:57.190 --> 05:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
documents in signing a document the
 
05:21:01.150 --> 05:21:01.160 align:start position:0%
sender uses his or her private key and
 
05:21:03.910 --> 05:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
ver algorithm to create an encrypted
 
05:21:06.510 --> 05:21:06.520 align:start position:0%

05:21:08.590 --> 05:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
set with the clear text document to a

05:21:13.270 --> 05:21:13.280 align:start position:0%

05:21:15.350 --> 05:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
uses the public portion of the center's
 
05:21:18.990 --> 05:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
key together both parts of the C D are
 
05:21:21.230 --> 05:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
used to verify the document was not
 
05:21:23.670 --> 05:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
altered and that it originated from the
 
05:21:27.030 --> 05:21:27.040 align:start position:0%

on

05:21:32.390 --> 05:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:21:34.230 --> 05:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
was part of
 
05:21:38.110 --> 05:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
what registered great incentives link to
 
05:21:40.868 --> 05:21:40.878 align:start position:0%
that right
 
05:21:44.470 --> 05:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:47.548 --> 05:21:47.558 align:start position:0%
Simpson um do can somebody I'm trying to
 
05:21:49.350 --> 05:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
find it real quick but tell me when the
 
05:21:51.708 --> 05:21:51.718 align:start position:0%
effective date for this bill would be
 
05:21:54.390 --> 05:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
because I I if this is not universally
 
05:21:59.150 --> 05:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
able to be done by um folks real quickly
 
05:22:01.670 --> 05:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
I don't want to if this is eff you know
 
05:22:01.680 --> 05:22:02.670 align:start position:0%
I don't want to if this is eff you know
July

05:22:02.670 --> 05:22:02.680 align:start position:0%
July
 
05:22:06.788 --> 05:22:06.798 align:start position:0%
1st um then that makes me anxious
 
05:22:10.910 --> 05:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
to expect the um compliance in such a
 
05:22:23.030 --> 05:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:27.030 --> 05:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
time 180 days after
 
05:22:29.350 --> 05:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
passage no
 
05:22:35.270 --> 05:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:35.280 --> 05:22:46.310 align:start position:0%
 
no

05:22:46.310 --> 05:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:54.030 --> 05:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:56.788 --> 05:22:56.798 align:start position:0%
uh part of it part of it says part of
 
05:22:59.270 --> 05:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
the bill is part of section
 
05:23:01.948 --> 05:23:01.958 align:start position:0%
two is uh
 
05:23:04.750 --> 05:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
upon passage and part of it is 180 days
 
05:23:04.760 --> 05:23:09.030 align:start position:0%
upon passage and part of it is 180 days
after

05:23:09.030 --> 05:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:11.830 --> 05:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
passage thank you Mr chair the the only
 
05:23:15.708 --> 05:23:15.718 align:start position:0%
thing I would say is that
 
05:23:18.948 --> 05:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
um this this this kind of language as
 
05:23:21.788 --> 05:23:21.798 align:start position:0%
representative wer said was requested by
 
05:23:24.310 --> 05:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
the registry of deeds because they have
 
05:23:26.910 --> 05:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
real concerns around the security we're
 
05:23:28.990 --> 05:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with real property and things of
 
05:23:31.310 --> 05:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
this nature so we we want to make sure
 
05:23:34.310 --> 05:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
that that's as secure as possible but we
 
05:23:37.670 --> 05:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
we can't forget that we still have what
 
05:23:40.190 --> 05:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
we've had for the last 300 years which
 
05:23:44.948 --> 05:23:44.958 align:start position:0%
is the manual um mode of of of of doing
 
05:23:47.788 --> 05:23:47.798 align:start position:0%
business as well that hasn't gone away
 
05:23:51.390 --> 05:23:51.400 align:start position:0%
this is just an added option so we are
 
05:23:54.430 --> 05:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
going to add it as an added option if
 
05:23:56.910 --> 05:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
the registry of deeds has raised these
 
05:24:00.310 --> 05:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
concerns um I think we can't lose sight
 
05:24:02.110 --> 05:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
that we still have the old manual option
 
05:24:03.750 --> 05:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
but we have to make this new option as
 
05:24:05.470 --> 05:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
secure as possible so I'm going to
 
05:24:07.788 --> 05:24:07.798 align:start position:0%
support the amendment even though some
 
05:24:10.510 --> 05:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
people may not have the ability to do it
 
05:24:10.520 --> 05:24:14.628 align:start position:0%
people may not have the ability to do it
right

05:24:14.628 --> 05:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:19.350 --> 05:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:19.360 --> 05:24:20.990 align:start position:0%
 
Simpson

05:24:20.990 --> 05:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
Simpson
 
05:24:25.150 --> 05:24:25.160 align:start position:0%
okay any any other yes representing mcf
 
05:24:27.310 --> 05:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
so thank you and I was I wanted to know
 
05:24:29.670 --> 05:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
if if uh representative walor had had a
 
05:24:31.868 --> 05:24:31.878 align:start position:0%
chance to run this any of the other
 
05:24:34.788 --> 05:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
groups the bankers the The Mortgage
 
05:24:36.590 --> 05:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
Bankers the real estate or the estate
 
05:24:39.190 --> 05:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
attorneys to look at this
 
05:24:42.190 --> 05:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
language I have
 
05:24:46.788 --> 05:24:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:50.470 --> 05:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
you one thing that uh I also point out
 
05:24:52.990 --> 05:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
is we also have a bill which we retain
 
05:24:56.310 --> 05:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
with regard to notarial services so if
 
05:24:59.670 --> 05:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
we do need to fix something we do have
 
05:25:05.310 --> 05:25:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:05.320 --> 05:25:06.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:25:06.830 --> 05:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
so

bill
 
05:27:34.190 --> 05:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
134 we received a letter from the
 
05:27:38.670 --> 05:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
registers of Deeds objecting to to uh
 
05:27:40.510 --> 05:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
part section 10 of the
 
05:27:45.470 --> 05:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
bill and in discussing it with uh the
 
05:27:47.948 --> 05:27:47.958 align:start position:0%
registers yesterday they indicated that
 
05:27:50.628 --> 05:27:50.638 align:start position:0%
they were unhappy over the fact
 
05:27:53.470 --> 05:27:53.480 align:start position:0%
that uh they have to deal with plats and
 
05:27:57.390 --> 05:27:57.400 align:start position:0%
maps and surveys of a land
 
05:27:59.910 --> 05:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
and uh and you just can't apply
 
05:28:03.190 --> 05:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
electronic signatures to them and so
 
05:28:05.510 --> 05:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
they wanted those to be accepted so this
 
05:28:07.868 --> 05:28:07.878 align:start position:0%
amendment what it does it indicates that
 
05:28:10.030 --> 05:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
a register Deeds shall accept for
 
05:28:12.548 --> 05:28:12.558 align:start position:0%
reporting a tangible copy of an
 
05:28:17.190 --> 05:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
electronic document other than a map
 
05:28:20.150 --> 05:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
plat survey or plat of land as provided
 
05:28:21.948 --> 05:28:21.958 align:start position:0%
in RSA
 
05:28:24.510 --> 05:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
47818 and the registers indicated that
 
05:28:25.750 --> 05:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
if we made that
 
05:28:28.708 --> 05:28:28.718 align:start position:0%
change uh my register at least indicated
 
05:28:32.470 --> 05:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
that they would be satisfied with the
 
05:28:35.670 --> 05:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
bill and so I'll offer that Amendment if
 
05:28:39.190 --> 05:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:42.230 --> 05:28:42.240 align:start position:0%

05:31:22.590 --> 05:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
05:31:27.030 --> 05:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
remove uh it's Amendment 1232
 
05:31:31.670 --> 05:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
H basically it would remove
 
05:31:39.948 --> 05:31:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:42.990 --> 05:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
entirety is there a second to
 
05:31:51.650 --> 05:31:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:51.660 --> 05:31:59.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

05:31:59.070 --> 05:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:59.080 --> 05:32:04.670 align:start position:0%
 
it

05:32:04.670 --> 05:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:06.150 --> 05:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
yeah this
 
05:32:09.708 --> 05:32:09.718 align:start position:0%
um the reason I'm doing this as you may
 
05:32:10.990 --> 05:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
recall the
 
05:32:14.628 --> 05:32:14.638 align:start position:0%
testimony uh the testimony is that
 
05:32:17.390 --> 05:32:17.400 align:start position:0%
basically this bill is already in the
 
05:32:20.390 --> 05:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
budget and they put the bill in the
 
05:32:23.470 --> 05:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
budget and put in a separate
 
05:32:26.430 --> 05:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
bill and it's still in the budget the
 
05:32:27.948 --> 05:32:27.958 align:start position:0%
only thing that they took out of the
 
05:32:30.628 --> 05:32:30.638 align:start position:0%
bill when the budget went forward
 
05:32:33.948 --> 05:32:33.958 align:start position:0%
was a provision that made uh the use of
 
05:32:33.958 --> 05:32:36.670 align:start position:0%
was a provision that made uh the use of
estimates

05:32:36.670 --> 05:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
05:32:40.150 --> 05:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
retroactive and the question was whether
 
05:32:41.390 --> 05:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
it was appropriate to make it
 
05:32:43.350 --> 05:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
retroactive and actually whether it
 
05:32:45.910 --> 05:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
would be enforcable if it was
 
05:32:49.030 --> 05:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
retroactive and since the legislation is
 
05:32:50.470 --> 05:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
already in the
 
05:32:54.110 --> 05:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
budget and frankly I'm not in agreement
 
05:32:56.350 --> 05:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily with making it
 
05:32:59.310 --> 05:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
retroactive the testimony actually uh
 
05:33:01.030 --> 05:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
was that
 
05:33:03.830 --> 05:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
that they've already used in the past
 
05:33:06.548 --> 05:33:06.558 align:start position:0%
they've used estimates for
 
05:33:09.470 --> 05:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
damages uh and they consistently used it
 
05:33:11.510 --> 05:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
except as I understand it the Attorney
 
05:33:13.830 --> 05:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
General now has taken the position
 
05:33:17.150 --> 05:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
that they don't think that they can
 
05:33:17.160 --> 05:33:19.470 align:start position:0%
that they don't think that they can
enforce

05:33:19.470 --> 05:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
05:33:25.270 --> 05:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
it and have elected not to enforce it so
 
05:33:26.868 --> 05:33:26.878 align:start position:0%
long and the short since it's already in
 
05:33:26.878 --> 05:33:27.830 align:start position:0%
long and the short since it's already in
the

05:33:27.830 --> 05:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:33:30.030 --> 05:33:30.040 align:start position:0%
budget with the exception of that one
 
05:33:31.708 --> 05:33:31.718 align:start position:0%
provision I think we should just remove
 
05:33:40.310 --> 05:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:44.190 --> 05:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
bill MC Beth I would support you I think
 
05:33:46.470 --> 05:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
that's the the reasonable way and the
 
05:33:49.548 --> 05:33:49.558 align:start position:0%
fair way to move forward thank
 
05:33:52.990 --> 05:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
you representative organ oh yes I agree
 
05:33:54.470 --> 05:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
with you too and I
 
05:33:56.708 --> 05:33:56.718 align:start position:0%
was this was sort of a gap for my
 
05:33:57.948 --> 05:33:57.958 align:start position:0%
knowledge I didn't realize that they
 
05:34:01.070 --> 05:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
don't um do the cost when calculating
 
05:34:02.868 --> 05:34:02.878 align:start position:0%
the liability for depreciation which is
 
05:34:05.510 --> 05:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
how it would be in the private sector
 
05:34:09.628 --> 05:34:09.638 align:start position:0%
but um anyway I I think there a I think
 
05:34:11.390 --> 05:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
this section is unnecessary and I don't
 
05:34:12.788 --> 05:34:12.798 align:start position:0%
necessarily agree with what's in the
 
05:34:14.990 --> 05:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
budget either but we don't need it here
 
05:34:15.000 --> 05:34:16.510 align:start position:0%
budget either but we don't need it here
so

05:34:16.510 --> 05:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:34:18.590 --> 05:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
thank thank
 
05:34:24.230 --> 05:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:27.548 --> 05:34:27.558 align:start position:0%
discussion then Mr clerk call a roll on

05:36:48.430 --> 05:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
uh those who are not familiar with
 
05:36:50.788 --> 05:36:50.798 align:start position:0%
structured settlements those are
 
05:36:54.110 --> 05:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
settlements uh where a person receives a
 
05:36:57.030 --> 05:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
settlement but it's paid uh into their
 
05:37:00.270 --> 05:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
pocket over time and some times that
 
05:37:02.628 --> 05:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
individual cannot wait the amount of
 
05:37:04.590 --> 05:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
time or chooses not to wait the amount
 
05:37:07.948 --> 05:37:07.958 align:start position:0%
of time and wishes to sell that uh
 
05:37:10.390 --> 05:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
settlement and get somewhat less money
 
05:37:13.430 --> 05:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
but getting it uh immediately in hand
 
05:37:15.868 --> 05:37:15.878 align:start position:0%
perfectly legal perfectly
 
05:37:20.910 --> 05:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
understandable um the original bill in
 
05:37:22.670 --> 05:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
in uh s SP
 
05:37:26.910 --> 05:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
134 would require a Court's
 
05:37:30.548 --> 05:37:30.558 align:start position:0%
approval uh in that it would require
 
05:37:33.868 --> 05:37:33.878 align:start position:0%
an individual to show the court that he
 
05:37:37.670 --> 05:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
or she had gone specifically to three or
 
05:37:42.150 --> 05:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
so um potential buyers of the structured
 
05:37:45.548 --> 05:37:45.558 align:start position:0%
settlement and uh go into the details of
 
05:37:45.558 --> 05:37:46.788 align:start position:0%
settlement and uh go into the details of
those

05:37:46.788 --> 05:37:46.798 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:37:50.548 --> 05:37:50.558 align:start position:0%
negotiations uh the idea is that uh uh
 
05:37:52.110 --> 05:37:52.120 align:start position:0%
the court wants to make sure that the
 
05:37:54.910 --> 05:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
seller is not being taken advantage of
 
05:37:54.920 --> 05:37:55.708 align:start position:0%
seller is not being taken advantage of
this

05:37:55.708 --> 05:37:55.718 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:37:59.070 --> 05:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
amendment um makes it somewhat less
 
05:37:59.080 --> 05:38:00.390 align:start position:0%
amendment um makes it somewhat less
owner

05:38:00.390 --> 05:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
owner
 
05:38:03.510 --> 05:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
on the uh seller of the structured
 
05:38:09.590 --> 05:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
settlement it says that that person can
 
05:38:14.230 --> 05:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
negotiate the uh the terms and that that
 
05:38:17.510 --> 05:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
person is advised to get uh competing
 
05:38:19.830 --> 05:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
offers and whether the C and when the
 
05:38:21.868 --> 05:38:21.878 align:start position:0%
court considers whether this structured
 
05:38:24.628 --> 05:38:24.638 align:start position:0%
settlement sale is a good idea or not it
 
05:38:26.110 --> 05:38:26.120 align:start position:0%
can take into
 
05:38:28.788 --> 05:38:28.798 align:start position:0%
consideration whether the seller has in
 
05:38:33.030 --> 05:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
fact uh talk to other people about um
 
05:38:36.868 --> 05:38:36.878 align:start position:0%
this the terms of a sale so it protects
 
05:38:40.110 --> 05:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
the privacy of the seller somewhat more
 
05:38:42.190 --> 05:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
than the original bill but still
 
05:38:44.948 --> 05:38:44.958 align:start position:0%
provides some uh method for the court to
 
05:38:48.910 --> 05:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that the uh uh seller isn't
 
05:38:52.468 --> 05:38:52.478 align:start position:0%
getting fleeced so to speak so uh that's
 
05:38:56.510 --> 05:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:03.190 --> 05:39:03.200 align:start position:0%

me
 
05:41:33.390 --> 05:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
sorry go ahead sorry
 
05:41:37.230 --> 05:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
Alexander so U as I understand it the
 
05:41:41.350 --> 05:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
collabortive law um currently is going
 
05:41:43.548 --> 05:41:43.558 align:start position:0%
on and it works
 
05:41:45.990 --> 05:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
well and it sounds like a great thing
 
05:41:49.708 --> 05:41:49.718 align:start position:0%
it's good option for folks um but I
 
05:41:52.150 --> 05:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
don't see because it is there and
 
05:41:54.548 --> 05:41:54.558 align:start position:0%
working uh I don't see the necessity of
 
05:41:58.270 --> 05:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
putting it into statute and therefore um
 
05:41:59.750 --> 05:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
moving to remove
 
05:42:05.590 --> 05:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:19.310 --> 05:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:22.670 --> 05:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
discussion I have to say that I think
 
05:42:27.310 --> 05:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
that is uh pretty much true that you can
 
05:42:30.030 --> 05:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
engage in collaborative law sort of
 
05:42:32.830 --> 05:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
formalizes something that takes
 
05:42:42.110 --> 05:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:46.548 --> 05:42:46.558 align:start position:0%
event any other discussion represent MC
 
05:42:48.190 --> 05:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
I'm really sorry to see this amendment
 
05:42:50.788 --> 05:42:50.798 align:start position:0%
brought forward um you know I feel like
 
05:42:53.150 --> 05:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
maybe the um you know we didn't have
 
05:42:56.708 --> 05:42:56.718 align:start position:0%
enough education on this process um it's
 
05:42:58.310 --> 05:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
really very different than a lot of the
 
05:43:00.868 --> 05:43:00.878 align:start position:0%
different um the current alternative
 
05:43:03.270 --> 05:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
dispute resolutions always having a
 
05:43:05.030 --> 05:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
mental health professional at the table
 
05:43:07.070 --> 05:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
to kind of point out when people start
 
05:43:09.190 --> 05:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
picking on each other or no say the
 
05:43:11.310 --> 05:43:11.320 align:start position:0%
triggers um and even when attorneys
 
05:43:13.628 --> 05:43:13.638 align:start position:0%
start to maybe you know forgetting that
 
05:43:15.628 --> 05:43:15.638 align:start position:0%
this is U going to be a collaborative
 
05:43:18.190 --> 05:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
process so um I can't support the
 
05:43:20.590 --> 05:43:20.600 align:start position:0%
amendment and I um I wish we could have
 
05:43:25.230 --> 05:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:28.030 --> 05:43:28.040 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair uh I can't support
 
05:43:36.788 --> 05:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
the amendment either and um what
 
05:43:41.390 --> 05:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
troubles me a bit is normally when we
 
05:43:44.788 --> 05:43:44.798 align:start position:0%
get together and the stakeholders
 
05:43:48.910 --> 05:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
involved in an issue have come to an
 
05:43:51.708 --> 05:43:51.718 align:start position:0%
understanding about the value of a way
 
05:43:54.230 --> 05:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
of approaching the issue unless there's
 
05:43:55.708 --> 05:43:55.718 align:start position:0%
some real
 
05:43:59.750 --> 05:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
problems uh that we see uh we tend to go
 
05:44:01.590 --> 05:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
along with it we see that in landlord
 
05:44:04.430 --> 05:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
tenant for instance you know if Elliot
 
05:44:06.628 --> 05:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
Barry and Nick Norman come in and and
 
05:44:09.310 --> 05:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
they're walking arm in arm we tend to
 
05:44:11.948 --> 05:44:11.958 align:start position:0%
give that a lot of credibility it seems
 
05:44:14.270 --> 05:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
to me and this isn't something that I've
 
05:44:18.150 --> 05:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
ever practiced in with and I'm on my
 
05:44:20.150 --> 05:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
first marriage so I don't know a whole
 
05:44:23.110 --> 05:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
lot about it from a uh a consumer point
 
05:44:28.390 --> 05:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
of view um the uh it seems to me that
 
05:44:29.750 --> 05:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
the party
 
05:44:33.468 --> 05:44:33.478 align:start position:0%
who are involved in this kind of process
 
05:44:35.590 --> 05:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
not only seem to think it's a really
 
05:44:37.430 --> 05:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
really good
 
05:44:39.708 --> 05:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
process but they would they think
 
05:44:42.868 --> 05:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
there's a benefit to having a certain
 
05:44:46.468 --> 05:44:46.478 align:start position:0%
amount of structure in our statute
 
05:44:50.030 --> 05:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
books and it seems to me unless there's
 
05:44:52.150 --> 05:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
something really horrible about that
 
05:44:56.590 --> 05:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
idea and I don't think there is um that
 
05:44:59.390 --> 05:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
we perhaps should listen to those that
 
05:45:03.230 --> 05:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
are actually living this dayt day and uh
 
05:45:06.390 --> 05:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
take their word for it and then let them
 
05:45:09.670 --> 05:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
do their their collaborative work uh in
 
05:45:12.948 --> 05:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
a way that uh benefits Society you know
 
05:45:14.948 --> 05:45:14.958 align:start position:0%
we have too many issues where we really
 
05:45:17.708 --> 05:45:17.718 align:start position:0%
have significant disagreements between
 
05:45:20.270 --> 05:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
various shareholders stakeholders you
 
05:45:22.548 --> 05:45:22.558 align:start position:0%
know why sit there and pick one where
 
05:45:27.150 --> 05:45:27.160 align:start position:0%
there really isn't a uh a quarrel about
 
05:45:29.070 --> 05:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
whether there's some the people people
 
05:45:31.468 --> 05:45:31.478 align:start position:0%
involved think there's a benefit to
 
05:45:33.708 --> 05:45:33.718 align:start position:0%
having it in statute that it'll work
 
05:45:37.070 --> 05:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
better it'll give some kind of referee
 
05:45:40.230 --> 05:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
status to the rules and I I see only
 
05:45:42.868 --> 05:45:42.878 align:start position:0%
gain and I don't see any harm in
 
05:45:45.510 --> 05:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
exceeding to their wishes and having a
 
05:45:49.788 --> 05:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
nice uh nice little statute to uh help
 
05:45:54.270 --> 05:45:54.280 align:start position:0%

and so uh
 
05:48:45.868 --> 05:48:45.878 align:start position:0%
as you uh we've discussed earlier we we
 
05:48:47.628 --> 05:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
passed out of this
 
05:48:50.468 --> 05:48:50.478 align:start position:0%
committee House Bill 540 we passed out
 
05:48:53.070 --> 05:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
of the committee 21 to
 
05:48:56.150 --> 05:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
nothing it was on the consent calendar
 
05:48:59.468 --> 05:48:59.478 align:start position:0%
it left the house went over to the
 
05:49:02.230 --> 05:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
Senate and then the Senate Judiciary
 
05:49:05.350 --> 05:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
Committee heard it there were something
 
05:49:07.390 --> 05:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
like 80 people who signed up in support
 
05:49:09.548 --> 05:49:09.558 align:start position:0%
of the bill and nobody in
 
05:49:12.868 --> 05:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
opposition and uh they heard testimony
 
05:49:15.590 --> 05:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
from people only in favor and then the
 
05:49:17.590 --> 05:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
Senate decided that they were going to
 
05:49:21.270 --> 05:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
re re-refer the bill and uh for what
 
05:49:24.270 --> 05:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
purpose I'm not sure but I think it
 
05:49:25.830 --> 05:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate to add those
 
05:49:25.840 --> 05:49:27.110 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate to add those
Provisions

05:49:27.110 --> 05:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
Provisions
 
05:49:29.030 --> 05:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
into Senate
 
05:49:32.590 --> 05:49:32.600 align:start position:0%
134 in the probate
 
05:49:35.390 --> 05:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
section I know I've
 
05:49:35.400 --> 05:49:37.708 align:start position:0%
section I know I've
heard

05:49:37.708 --> 05:49:37.718 align:start position:0%
heard
 
05:49:37.718 --> 05:49:39.230 align:start position:0%
heard
from

05:49:39.230 --> 05:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:49:42.670 --> 05:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
from Judge King that in fact this would
 
05:49:45.750 --> 05:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
be good for the probate courts uh in
 
05:49:48.830 --> 05:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
that to the extent that people can find
 
05:49:50.708 --> 05:49:50.718 align:start position:0%
guidance from somebody without having to
 
05:49:52.468 --> 05:49:52.478 align:start position:0%
have a formal guardianship it will save
 
05:49:54.430 --> 05:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
time and effort on the part of the
 
05:49:56.708 --> 05:49:56.718 align:start position:0%
courts and so I think it's an
 
05:50:00.990 --> 05:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:02.460 --> 05:50:02.470 align:start position:0%

05:53:21.910 --> 05:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
is this something that you sent out to
 
05:53:24.548 --> 05:53:24.558 align:start position:0%
us I did not send it out I sent it to
 
05:53:26.788 --> 05:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
all ask the intent of the amendment was
 
05:53:30.310 --> 05:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
to remove this of the
 
05:53:36.070 --> 05:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
bill but what sent me back do
 
05:53:38.110 --> 05:53:38.120 align:start position:0%
that they
 
05:53:41.910 --> 05:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
removed all but the study committee so I
 
05:53:53.910 --> 05:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:56.310 --> 05:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
yesterday so at this point in time you
 
05:54:19.670 --> 05:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:22.590 --> 05:54:22.600 align:start position:0%
one Mr chair I had the amendment back on
 
05:54:24.628 --> 05:54:24.638 align:start position:0%
part one we want to go back and clean up
 
05:54:28.070 --> 05:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
one while he looks for part eight or we
 
05:54:33.708 --> 05:54:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:36.628 --> 05:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
that well what we'll do is well uh
 
05:54:38.788 --> 05:54:38.798 align:start position:0%
representative wer has an amendment on
 
05:54:40.310 --> 05:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
part eight but he's having some
 
05:54:42.430 --> 05:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
difficulty locating it so what we'll do
 
05:54:45.230 --> 05:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
is we'll go back to part one of Senate
 
05:54:48.350 --> 05:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
Bill 134 now that the amendment is
 
05:54:56.990 --> 05:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:01.190 --> 05:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
with so so go ahead representative CL
 
05:55:03.190 --> 05:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:55:06.230 --> 05:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
um so um in light of our discussion
 
05:55:09.548 --> 05:55:09.558 align:start position:0%
around 143 and the acceptance of uh
 
05:55:13.310 --> 05:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
Senate amendments um Senator Carson had
 
05:55:16.788 --> 05:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
offered an amendment on part one of uh
 
05:55:20.750 --> 05:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
HB 134 which we did have to redraft um
 
05:55:23.390 --> 05:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
so her original Amendment which would be
 
05:55:28.190 --> 05:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
in everybody's email is amendment 1196 s
 
05:55:31.990 --> 05:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
um the house version converted over is
 
05:55:32.000 --> 05:55:35.030 align:start position:0%
um the house version converted over is
um

05:55:35.030 --> 05:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:39.868 --> 05:55:39.878 align:start position:0%
135h so um the text is identical to um
 
05:55:43.628 --> 05:55:43.638 align:start position:0%
1196 s it's just converted over um as as
 
05:55:48.270 --> 05:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
a house Amendment so what part one of um
 
05:55:48.280 --> 05:55:49.390 align:start position:0%
a house Amendment so what part one of um
HB

05:55:49.390 --> 05:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
HB
 
05:55:54.510 --> 05:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
134 does is it basically looks at the
 
05:55:56.468 --> 05:55:56.478 align:start position:0%
law that we passed in
 
05:56:00.030 --> 05:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
2016 that makes it illegal to point
 
05:56:03.350 --> 05:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
laser pointers um at um at aircraft
 
05:56:05.510 --> 05:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
obviously that's a very dangerous
 
05:56:09.548 --> 05:56:09.558 align:start position:0%
situation uh so we passed that law um
 
05:56:12.510 --> 05:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
however the unintended consequences of
 
05:56:15.910 --> 05:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
passing that law were that um many
 
05:56:19.990 --> 05:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
legitimate uses of lasers became illegal
 
05:56:22.150 --> 05:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh they they kind of got caught up in it
 
05:56:26.868 --> 05:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
so full disclosure um this part of uh
 
05:56:29.628 --> 05:56:29.638 align:start position:0%
hb34 is very important to me it's very
 
05:56:31.590 --> 05:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
important to my district and it's very
 
05:56:33.990 --> 05:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
important to the city of Manchester um
 
05:56:37.110 --> 05:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
vae is locating a new research facility
 
05:56:39.190 --> 05:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
there and in the process of bringing
 
05:56:42.150 --> 05:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
that in they realized that um a lot of
 
05:56:44.670 --> 05:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
their work that they would be doing is
 
05:56:47.788 --> 05:56:47.798 align:start position:0%
made illegal because of the current
 
05:56:50.830 --> 05:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
nature of the law and so when they went
 
05:56:53.310 --> 05:56:53.320 align:start position:0%
in and began investigating it basically
 
05:56:55.150 --> 05:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
they they undid a can of worms there's
 
05:56:57.990 --> 05:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
multiple legitimately uses that um are
 
05:57:00.430 --> 05:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
made illegal by the current statute so
 
05:57:03.430 --> 05:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
whether it's medical lasers whether it's
 
05:57:05.548 --> 05:57:05.558 align:start position:0%
construction whether it's the use of
 
05:57:08.150 --> 05:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
lasers uh for survey with
 
05:57:12.230 --> 05:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
do um whether it's the the crash liar
 
05:57:14.510 --> 05:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
that you have in your vehicle all of
 
05:57:18.868 --> 05:57:18.878 align:start position:0%
that stuff is rendered um really illegal
 
05:57:21.590 --> 05:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
under our current laser pointer statute
 
05:57:25.990 --> 05:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
so what HB 134 did it it reached out to
 
05:57:28.868 --> 05:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
various stakeholders to try to capture
 
05:57:31.468 --> 05:57:31.478 align:start position:0%
as comprehensive a list of possible of
 
05:57:35.670 --> 05:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
the legitimate uses of lasers so that
 
05:57:37.670 --> 05:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
they could be Exempted of of the
 
05:57:41.110 --> 05:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
existing law and um the amendment that
 
05:57:43.868 --> 05:57:43.878 align:start position:0%
we have um which we just had converted
 
05:57:46.190 --> 05:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
over from a senate version basically
 
05:57:49.468 --> 05:57:49.478 align:start position:0%
what it does is it it extends the
 
05:57:53.708 --> 05:57:53.718 align:start position:0%
prohibition element of um the law to
 
05:57:56.990 --> 05:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
drones um because there was concern
 
05:58:00.430 --> 05:58:00.440 align:start position:0%
raised that while you can't Point uh a
 
05:58:03.430 --> 05:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
laser pointer at a vehicle or or an
 
05:58:07.030 --> 05:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
airplane if you had a drone you could
 
05:58:09.510 --> 05:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
put the laser pointer on a drone and
 
05:58:11.788 --> 05:58:11.798 align:start position:0%
then by piloting the Drone you could aim
 
05:58:13.430 --> 05:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
it at an airplane and that's kind of a
 
05:58:16.510 --> 05:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
loophole so the amendment basically
 
05:58:19.230 --> 05:58:19.240 align:start position:0%
addresses that loophole so as I said
 
05:58:21.310 --> 05:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
this I I think it's it's important
 
05:58:24.070 --> 05:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
legislation and I hope everybody on the
 
05:58:27.030 --> 05:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
committee will uh join me in supporting
 
05:58:29.788 --> 05:58:29.798 align:start position:0%
the amendment and and this part of the
 
05:58:33.510 --> 05:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:37.390 --> 05:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
bur thank you Mr chair and hopefully
 
05:58:40.590 --> 05:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
representative mlan can help me out here
 
05:58:45.430 --> 05:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
um because I don't read the language of
 
05:58:45.440 --> 05:58:46.310 align:start position:0%
um because I don't read the language of
the

05:58:46.310 --> 05:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:58:50.310 --> 05:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
amendment to do what I think you rightly
 
05:58:53.430 --> 05:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
suggest might need to be done so my
 
05:58:56.390 --> 05:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
question is uh I'm looking at the
 
05:58:58.350 --> 05:58:58.360 align:start position:0%
crossed out language and then I'm
 
05:59:00.948 --> 05:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
looking at the new language and the
 
05:59:03.548 --> 05:59:03.558 align:start position:0%
crossed out language talks about
 
05:59:06.910 --> 05:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
purposely or knowingly shining a laser
 
05:59:08.070 --> 05:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
in an
 
05:59:10.830 --> 05:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
aircraft uh with some other language but
 
05:59:13.430 --> 05:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
basically that and it changes it it
 
05:59:16.830 --> 05:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
drops out purposely or knowingly and
 
05:59:18.830 --> 05:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
just has
 
05:59:21.230 --> 05:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
knowingly and it still deals with
 
05:59:23.310 --> 05:59:23.320 align:start position:0%
pointing a device at an
 
05:59:25.708 --> 05:59:25.718 align:start position:0%
aircraft it seems to be that's all it's
 
05:59:28.390 --> 05:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
dealing with not all those other
 
05:59:31.110 --> 05:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh aspects that you say are
 
05:59:33.990 --> 05:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
problematic it just makes something
 
05:59:37.390 --> 05:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
that's extremely dangerous harder to
 
05:59:40.270 --> 05:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
prosecute because instead of having
 
05:59:40.280 --> 05:59:41.990 align:start position:0%
prosecute because instead of having
two

05:59:41.990 --> 05:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:59:46.548 --> 05:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
um uh mental Frameworks purposely
 
05:59:49.548 --> 05:59:49.558 align:start position:0%
knowingly now the only thing illegal
 
05:59:50.670 --> 05:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:59:53.310 --> 05:59:53.320 align:start position:0%
knowingly I mean you could purposely do
 
05:59:55.110 --> 05:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
it and
 
05:59:59.190 --> 05:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
not committing any sort of uh offense so
 
06:00:01.910 --> 06:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you could explain why
 
06:00:05.110 --> 06:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
this particular Amendment does all the
 
06:00:08.708 --> 06:00:08.718 align:start position:0%
things that you say need to be done sure
 
06:00:13.350 --> 06:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
um first of all um the original bill as
 
06:00:16.430 --> 06:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
submitted was the the part that carved
 
06:00:19.110 --> 06:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
out the exemption so if you want to go
 
06:00:21.310 --> 06:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
and you want to examine that if you
 
06:00:23.468 --> 06:00:23.478 align:start position:0%
forget the the amendment that was
 
06:00:26.510 --> 06:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
offered but if you go back into the bill
 
06:00:32.270 --> 06:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
itself and um you you'll see that in uh
 
06:00:35.468 --> 06:00:35.478 align:start position:0%
section uh let me see what page is it
 
06:00:40.910 --> 06:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
page two um line 22 this section shall
 
06:00:42.910 --> 06:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
not prohibit aiming a laser beam or
 
06:00:44.990 --> 06:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
pointing at a motor vehicle aircraft
 
06:00:47.430 --> 06:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
vessel window structure or any person by
 
06:00:49.390 --> 06:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
any of the following and it goes through
 
06:00:51.070 --> 06:00:51.080 align:start position:0%
the list an authorized person in the
 
06:00:53.750 --> 06:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
conduct of research government persons
 
06:00:55.990 --> 06:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
authorized by the government Aerospace
 
06:00:58.708 --> 06:00:58.718 align:start position:0%
contractors individual all are using
 
06:01:01.548 --> 06:01:01.558 align:start position:0%
laser emergency signaling emergency
 
06:01:04.990 --> 06:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
distress signal medical lasers so all of
 
06:01:07.468 --> 06:01:07.478 align:start position:0%
those exemptions representative Burch
 
06:01:10.990 --> 06:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
are not in the amendment um those are in
 
06:01:13.788 --> 06:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
the the body of of the the main Bill
 
06:01:17.110 --> 06:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
itself it's just having G through they
 
06:01:19.150 --> 06:01:19.160 align:start position:0%
they wanted to clarify that you could
 
06:01:20.628 --> 06:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
not use a drone and that's what the
 
06:01:20.638 --> 06:01:22.110 align:start position:0%
not use a drone and that's what the
amendment

06:01:22.110 --> 06:01:22.120 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:01:25.150 --> 06:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
does I'm not quarreling if if I may
 
06:01:27.270 --> 06:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
follow up I'm not quarreling with with
 
06:01:32.030 --> 06:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
the language in sb34 I understand the
 
06:01:34.628 --> 06:01:34.638 align:start position:0%
purposes I'm just talking about what
 
06:01:37.310 --> 06:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment that we have in our hands
 
06:01:40.230 --> 06:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
is designed to do uh in terms of
 
06:01:41.948 --> 06:01:41.958 align:start position:0%
changing uh
 
06:01:45.270 --> 06:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
134 and it looks to me like it's only
 
06:01:49.110 --> 06:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
making it uh uh harder to prosecute for
 
06:01:52.030 --> 06:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
pointing a laser at an airplane and I'm
 
06:01:55.750 --> 06:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
not sure why we should support that so
 
06:01:58.150 --> 06:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
06:02:00.948 --> 06:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
I I was quite with you for a minute but
 
06:02:02.190 --> 06:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
as I read
 
06:02:05.070 --> 06:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
this it says for any person in direct or
 
06:02:08.788 --> 06:02:08.798 align:start position:0%
remote control right right right which
 
06:02:12.190 --> 06:02:12.200 align:start position:0%
is different from what was
 
06:02:15.430 --> 06:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
there right so so and I think it's the
 
06:02:18.150 --> 06:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
remote control part that's more
 
06:02:18.160 --> 06:02:20.510 align:start position:0%
remote control part that's more
important

06:02:20.510 --> 06:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
important
 
06:02:23.350 --> 06:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
than what I consider redundant purposely
 
06:02:27.670 --> 06:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
or knowing right yeah and if I may Mr
 
06:02:29.830 --> 06:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
Cher so yeah so maybe I misunderstood
 
06:02:32.350 --> 06:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
your that's representative woler laid it
 
06:02:36.510 --> 06:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
right on the head that the initial um
 
06:02:39.548 --> 06:02:39.558 align:start position:0%
the initial bill from
 
06:02:42.830 --> 06:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
2016 makes no provision for remote
 
06:02:45.948 --> 06:02:45.958 align:start position:0%
control and so that so as we've learned
 
06:02:49.708 --> 06:02:49.718 align:start position:0%
more about drones they wanted to make
 
06:02:53.270 --> 06:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
sure that someone who is using a drone
 
06:02:56.310 --> 06:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
under the old statute hey I'm not
 
06:02:58.430 --> 06:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
pointing it at the the airplane the
 
06:03:00.468 --> 06:03:00.478 align:start position:0%
Drone is pointing it at the airplane I
 
06:03:02.868 --> 06:03:02.878 align:start position:0%
may be controlling that drone but
 
06:03:04.190 --> 06:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
there's a stretch so this this was
 
06:03:06.830 --> 06:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
sought to just clarify
 
06:03:08.628 --> 06:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
that all
 
06:03:10.548 --> 06:03:10.558 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
06:03:10.558 --> 06:03:12.270 align:start position:0%
right okay
representative

06:03:12.270 --> 06:03:12.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:03:12.280 --> 06:03:24.948 align:start position:0%
representative
IED

06:03:24.948 --> 06:03:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:29.350 --> 06:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
by yeah uh I'm got to call on the
 
06:03:31.030 --> 06:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
committee Members
 
06:03:34.350 --> 06:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
First representative
 
06:03:38.070 --> 06:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
Simpson I I'm just trying to um maybe I
 
06:03:39.548 --> 06:03:39.558 align:start position:0%
can add something to clarify this a
 
06:03:42.070 --> 06:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
little bit this amendment deals with a
 
06:03:44.030 --> 06:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
different a whole different part of the
 
06:03:46.468 --> 06:03:46.478 align:start position:0%
statut than the part that's already in
 
06:03:49.868 --> 06:03:49.878 align:start position:0%
the written up Bill so this this one
 
06:03:52.910 --> 06:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
that is brought up right now deals with
 
06:03:54.270 --> 06:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
the What's called the New Hampshire
 
06:03:58.548 --> 06:03:58.558 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics act in statute 42 2 and so
 
06:04:01.310 --> 06:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
it's just fixing um under the
 
06:04:04.110 --> 06:04:04.120 align:start position:0%
prohibitions under the Aeronautics act
 
06:04:06.708 --> 06:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
it's accounting for there being drones
 
06:04:09.910 --> 06:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
now that might fly lasers so yes it does
 
06:04:12.788 --> 06:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
change the language um from purposely
 
06:04:15.708 --> 06:04:15.718 align:start position:0%
and knowingly to knowingly um and and
 
06:04:18.750 --> 06:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
that's we can discuss that more but I I
 
06:04:20.868 --> 06:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point out that it's it's
 
06:04:23.670 --> 06:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
correcting a different statute but but
 
06:04:26.150 --> 06:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
still doing it in part one of
 
06:04:29.670 --> 06:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
06:04:32.510 --> 06:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
Alexander um thank you Mr chair I think
 
06:04:35.150 --> 06:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
um representative Simpson um did a great
 
06:04:37.310 --> 06:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
job in clarifying that language change I
 
06:04:39.670 --> 06:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
think like the the point of this is to
 
06:04:41.788 --> 06:04:41.798 align:start position:0%
address unintended consequences from an
 
06:04:44.510 --> 06:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
act that was put in place years ago um
 
06:04:48.230 --> 06:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
in which Bae and other um industry and
 
06:04:50.548 --> 06:04:50.558 align:start position:0%
other R&amp;D agencies in this state are not
 
06:04:53.310 --> 06:04:53.320 align:start position:0%
able to um do some secret military
 
06:04:55.430 --> 06:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
contracts um based on certain things in
 
06:04:57.670 --> 06:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
statute I think that that might be um
 
06:05:00.670 --> 06:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why we should support
 
06:05:03.628 --> 06:05:03.638 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
06:05:06.150 --> 06:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
Sylvia I'll get back to the uh the heart
 
06:05:08.350 --> 06:05:08.360 align:start position:0%
of the problem is that we have this
 
06:05:11.830 --> 06:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
statute talking about uh laser pointing
 
06:05:11.840 --> 06:05:13.190 align:start position:0%
statute talking about uh laser pointing
devices

06:05:13.190 --> 06:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
devices
 
06:05:16.510 --> 06:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
and uh the industry is now taking that
 
06:05:20.468 --> 06:05:20.478 align:start position:0%
as any laser type uh
 
06:05:22.750 --> 06:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
product and I don't think that was the
 
06:05:25.150 --> 06:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
intention of the bill and when it I
 
06:05:26.350 --> 06:05:26.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say Bill but when it was
 
06:05:28.990 --> 06:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
originally brought back in 1999 and a
 
06:05:33.270 --> 06:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
good Senator sat on sponsored this bill
 
06:05:37.468 --> 06:05:37.478 align:start position:0%
uh at the time and uh with a a bad
 
06:05:40.548 --> 06:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
description of what we're talking
 
06:05:44.310 --> 06:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
about uh we have tremendous problems so
 
06:05:46.590 --> 06:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
there's a fundamental underlying issue
 
06:05:48.990 --> 06:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
that should be corrected uh frankly I
 
06:05:50.750 --> 06:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
would repeal the whole thing for the
 
06:05:53.830 --> 06:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
moment until we can actually get down to
 
06:05:55.270 --> 06:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
what it is we're talking about so we're
 
06:05:56.430 --> 06:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
all talking about the same thing at the
 
06:06:01.670 --> 06:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:03.030 --> 06:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative czon did you have your
 
06:06:03.040 --> 06:06:05.628 align:start position:0%
representative czon did you have your
hand

06:06:05.628 --> 06:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:07.948 --> 06:06:07.958 align:start position:0%
up I couldn't get it to go back down
 
06:06:09.110 --> 06:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
I'll work on
 
06:06:12.830 --> 06:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
that there there is somebody who is an
 
06:06:16.350 --> 06:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
attendee who may be able to contribute
 
06:06:19.310 --> 06:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
and that's uh Mr kzy does anybody have
 
06:06:21.788 --> 06:06:21.798 align:start position:0%
an objection if I were to call upon Mr
 
06:06:25.230 --> 06:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
kzy to add an exp explanation and who
 
06:06:28.548 --> 06:06:28.558 align:start position:0%
would Mr kzy be representing okay I
 
06:06:31.628 --> 06:06:31.638 align:start position:0%
believe he is an industry representative
 
06:06:39.150 --> 06:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:42.628 --> 06:06:42.638 align:start position:0%
bill I'm not going to stand in the way
 
06:06:45.628 --> 06:06:45.638 align:start position:0%
of um I know it hasn't been our practice
 
06:06:50.110 --> 06:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
to call on of Ed of education but
 
06:06:53.590 --> 06:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't think lobbying if there's
 
06:06:58.190 --> 06:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
educational information that's one thing
 
06:07:00.990 --> 06:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
but representing a particular private
 
06:07:02.510 --> 06:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
interest is something that makes me a
 
06:07:03.990 --> 06:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
little nervous but I'm not going to
 
06:07:07.390 --> 06:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
stand in the way well uh I think uh
 
06:07:09.190 --> 06:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
we've taken the position that we are not
 
06:07:11.548 --> 06:07:11.558 align:start position:0%
going to include people in the audience
 
06:07:14.350 --> 06:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
for our executive session so I think
 
06:07:17.468 --> 06:07:17.478 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll stand on that
 
06:07:24.230 --> 06:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:27.590 --> 06:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
concerns okay so we have amendment in
 
06:07:30.910 --> 06:07:30.920 align:start position:0%

nine this is making an appropriation for
 
06:14:11.150 --> 06:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:14.788 --> 06:14:14.798 align:start position:0%
programs Mr chairman um if I could just
 
06:14:17.390 --> 06:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
make a comment
 
06:14:20.750 --> 06:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
um I think this state is not doing what
 
06:14:25.270 --> 06:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
we should be doing to address the issues
 
06:14:25.280 --> 06:14:26.990 align:start position:0%
we should be doing to address the issues
of

06:14:26.990 --> 06:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:14:29.948 --> 06:14:29.958 align:start position:0%
of the crisis in mental health the
 
06:14:31.628 --> 06:14:31.638 align:start position:0%
crisis that's been
 
06:14:35.190 --> 06:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
exacerbated by the pandemic but was
 
06:14:39.190 --> 06:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
there before and will be there after I
 
06:14:44.670 --> 06:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:44.680 --> 06:14:46.190 align:start position:0%
 
appropriation

06:14:46.190 --> 06:14:46.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
06:14:49.150 --> 06:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
um inserted in the
 
06:14:49.160 --> 06:14:50.750 align:start position:0%
um inserted in the
middle

06:14:50.750 --> 06:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
middle
 
06:14:54.670 --> 06:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
of one of these Omnibus bills and
 
06:14:59.070 --> 06:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
although there is an FN it's 134
 
06:15:03.350 --> 06:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
FN it is not going to go to a second
 
06:15:07.830 --> 06:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
committee it will not be um
 
06:15:10.350 --> 06:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
Incorporated uh in the workings of the
 
06:15:14.110 --> 06:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
finance committee um to my knowledge it
 
06:15:17.110 --> 06:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
was not considered uh by the finance
 
06:15:20.030 --> 06:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
committee in the
 
06:15:22.150 --> 06:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
um in the
 
06:15:25.030 --> 06:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
Senate so I have a
 
06:15:29.350 --> 06:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:33.788 --> 06:15:33.798 align:start position:0%
haven't done anything about submitting
 
06:15:37.430 --> 06:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
an an amendment and to do anything that
 
06:15:40.868 --> 06:15:40.878 align:start position:0%
in any way made it seem that I did not
 
06:15:43.750 --> 06:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
recognize the crisis that we're facing
 
06:15:45.910 --> 06:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
would make me unhappy so thank you for
 
06:15:55.110 --> 06:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:55.120 --> 06:15:56.708 align:start position:0%
 
anything

06:15:56.708 --> 06:15:56.718 align:start position:0%
anything
 
06:16:01.030 --> 06:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
well yeah I I frankly I I can I can do
 
06:16:03.948 --> 06:16:03.958 align:start position:0%
the same thing and
 
06:16:06.910 --> 06:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
nothing but i i s of feel the same way
 
06:16:09.468 --> 06:16:09.478 align:start position:0%
it's an appropriation for 210,000 I I
 
06:16:11.670 --> 06:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
don't know why it's included in this
 
06:16:15.468 --> 06:16:15.478 align:start position:0%
bill it seems to me that uh typically
 
06:16:16.868 --> 06:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
what the Senate does is when they have
 
06:16:18.750 --> 06:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
an appropriation like this they pass it
 
06:16:21.708 --> 06:16:21.718 align:start position:0%
over there then they table it and then
 
06:16:23.708 --> 06:16:23.718 align:start position:0%
they include it in their budget rather
 
06:16:26.628 --> 06:16:26.638 align:start position:0%
than sending it over to us I've tried to
 
06:16:29.948 --> 06:16:29.958 align:start position:0%
figure out why it is that they felt
 
06:16:31.788 --> 06:16:31.798 align:start position:0%
compelled to do it in this particular
 
06:16:31.798 --> 06:16:34.270 align:start position:0%
compelled to do it in this particular
field

06:16:34.270 --> 06:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
field
 
06:16:37.110 --> 06:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
right but I frankly I didn't do an
 
06:16:39.830 --> 06:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
amendment to take it out but I would be
 
06:16:46.310 --> 06:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:48.590 --> 06:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
were representative
 
06:16:52.150 --> 06:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
organ uh well this is a somewhat shaded
 
06:16:54.310 --> 06:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
comment but perhaps they're anticipating
 
06:16:56.868 --> 06:16:56.878 align:start position:0%
that uh the budget isn't going to be
 
06:16:59.750 --> 06:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
passed on time as and that has happened
 
06:17:02.430 --> 06:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
in several recent budget Cycles but they
 
06:17:05.030 --> 06:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
felt this is important enough so that
 
06:17:07.830 --> 06:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee could authorize
 
06:17:09.948 --> 06:17:09.958 align:start position:0%
expenditure of a funds because there's
 
06:17:11.548 --> 06:17:11.558 align:start position:0%
always like piggy banks you can break
 
06:17:14.230 --> 06:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
open of you know lapses you know funds
 
06:17:17.070 --> 06:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
that have haven't been spent yet but um
 
06:17:19.830 --> 06:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
I mean I share represent Smith and
 
06:17:21.390 --> 06:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
resent Gordon and I two have not
 
06:17:23.110 --> 06:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
introduced an amendment to take it out
 
06:17:23.120 --> 06:17:24.230 align:start position:0%
introduced an amendment to take it out
but

06:17:24.230 --> 06:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:17:27.548 --> 06:17:27.558 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair could I I ask the
 
06:17:31.948 --> 06:17:31.958 align:start position:0%
clerk I have two numbers here and I have
 
06:17:36.230 --> 06:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
no idea I have an amendment 1223 and an
 
06:17:36.240 --> 06:17:42.350 align:start position:0%
no idea I have an amendment 1223 and an
amendment

06:17:42.350 --> 06:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:45.590 --> 06:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
1273 I thought
 
06:17:48.708 --> 06:17:48.718 align:start position:0%
that representative mlan had
 
06:17:51.430 --> 06:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
introduced one of those but I guess I'm
 
06:17:53.670 --> 06:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
wrong well
 
06:17:56.590 --> 06:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
12 yeah 1223
 
06:18:00.430 --> 06:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
um representative Smith was for 143 yeah
 
06:18:00.440 --> 06:18:02.190 align:start position:0%
um representative Smith was for 143 yeah
so

06:18:02.190 --> 06:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:18:05.788 --> 06:18:05.798 align:start position:0%
we yeah I know
 
06:18:08.628 --> 06:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
it's F
 
06:18:12.548 --> 06:18:12.558 align:start position:0%
this and actually 1273 is Reverend
 
06:18:14.230 --> 06:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
Smith's Amendment which is relative to
 
06:18:16.190 --> 06:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
Part 10 but we haven't gotten there yet
 
06:18:18.468 --> 06:18:18.478 align:start position:0%
that's yeah I have trouble keeping these
 
06:18:22.510 --> 06:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
134s and 143s and all these 1200 numbers
 
06:18:25.548 --> 06:18:25.558 align:start position:0%
so straight myself so representative
 
06:18:30.670 --> 06:18:30.680 align:start position:0%
Smith 1273 is titled amendment to
 
06:18:34.628 --> 06:18:34.638 align:start position:0%
sb43 yeah oh yeah so I'm totally yeah
 
06:18:37.830 --> 06:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
which we've already okay you're right
 
06:18:40.270 --> 06:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
there being being no no amendment to
 
06:18:44.110 --> 06:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
part nine we move on to Part
 
06:18:47.430 --> 06:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
10 rather rather relative to employer
 
06:18:54.830 --> 06:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:54.840 --> 06:18:59.670 align:start position:0%
 
records

06:18:59.670 --> 06:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:59.680 --> 06:19:06.110 align:start position:0%
 
have

06:19:06.110 --> 06:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:09.910 --> 06:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:16.150 --> 06:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:16.160 --> 06:19:18.628 align:start position:0%
 
could

06:19:18.628 --> 06:19:18.638 align:start position:0%
could
 
06:19:24.430 --> 06:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
I have no right to ask what I'm going to
 
06:19:28.670 --> 06:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
ask and you have every right to say
 
06:19:32.590 --> 06:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
no but I think that some of us have been
 
06:19:32.600 --> 06:19:34.030 align:start position:0%
no but I think that some of us have been
confused

06:19:34.030 --> 06:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
confused
 
06:19:40.868 --> 06:19:40.878 align:start position:0%
about amendments for sections nine and
 
06:19:44.310 --> 06:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
10 I was wondering if you would consider
 
06:19:44.320 --> 06:19:45.910 align:start position:0%
10 I was wondering if you would consider
the

06:19:45.910 --> 06:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:19:49.190 --> 06:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
possibility of us
 
06:19:52.310 --> 06:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
completing going through 11 and then I
 
06:19:54.590 --> 06:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if there are any additions
 
06:19:59.430 --> 06:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
and then instead of taking a final
 
06:19:59.440 --> 06:20:01.468 align:start position:0%
and then instead of taking a final
vote

06:20:01.468 --> 06:20:01.478 align:start position:0%

06:20:19.910 --> 06:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:22.548 --> 06:20:22.558 align:start position:0%

06:20:24.590 --> 06:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
work that doesn't work I have to take
 
06:20:27.708 --> 06:20:27.718 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for being confused
 
06:20:35.150 --> 06:20:35.160 align:start position:0%

on that proposal but since it's been
 
06:20:50.628 --> 06:20:50.638 align:start position:0%

06:21:00.510 --> 06:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:04.150 --> 06:21:04.160 align:start position:0%

06:21:31.878 --> 06:21:34.590 align:start position:0%
 
thought

06:21:34.590 --> 06:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
thought
 
06:21:38.430 --> 06:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
what what's your amendment
 
06:21:43.270 --> 06:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:46.990 --> 06:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
H and is there a second to
 
06:21:49.150 --> 06:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
that I second
 
06:21:54.548 --> 06:21:54.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:58.430 --> 06:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
B yeah one two one three and you want to
 
06:22:01.350 --> 06:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
speak to your Amendment representative
 
06:22:04.070 --> 06:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
Simpson yes
 
06:22:07.310 --> 06:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
um and I believe that Peter Bixby
 
06:22:09.670 --> 06:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby wrote to us all as
 
06:22:13.510 --> 06:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
well um this takes the opportunity to us
 
06:22:16.910 --> 06:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
of us having a section on hemp to
 
06:22:19.350 --> 06:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
correct a part of our statute that
 
06:22:21.910 --> 06:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't match up with the rules that the
 
06:22:26.190 --> 06:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
USDA has in um place right now
 
06:22:26.200 --> 06:22:27.270 align:start position:0%
USDA has in um place right now
um

06:22:27.270 --> 06:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:29.310 --> 06:22:29.320 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if you all have it in
 
06:22:30.830 --> 06:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
front of you it's very short if you'd
 
06:22:34.150 --> 06:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
like me to read the change I'm happy
 
06:22:36.590 --> 06:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
to what what it is short so why don't
 
06:22:39.430 --> 06:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
you just read it so that we'll
 
06:22:41.750 --> 06:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
understand hemp is an Agricultural
 
06:22:43.830 --> 06:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
Product which may be grown as a crop
 
06:22:45.670 --> 06:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
processed possessed and commercially
 
06:22:49.150 --> 06:22:49.160 align:start position:0%
traded in New Hampshire any grower of
 
06:22:51.548 --> 06:22:51.558 align:start position:0%
hemp shall be licensed by the
 
06:22:54.750 --> 06:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
USDA and so what it does is it takes out
 
06:22:57.468 --> 06:22:57.478 align:start position:0%
um proc processor and Commercial Trader
 
06:23:00.750 --> 06:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
because the USDA doesn't um doesn't
 
06:23:03.750 --> 06:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
license processors and Traders but we
 
06:23:06.548 --> 06:23:06.558 align:start position:0%
had it in statute that they do so it
 
06:23:08.350 --> 06:23:08.360 align:start position:0%
just leaves Growers because they do
 
06:23:08.360 --> 06:23:11.468 align:start position:0%
just leaves Growers because they do
license

06:23:11.468 --> 06:23:11.478 align:start position:0%

it um if we go through and look at Laser
 
06:29:45.670 --> 06:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
pointing devices we have no idea what
 
06:29:48.230 --> 06:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
those uh were really talking about in
 
06:29:50.948 --> 06:29:50.958 align:start position:0%
the statute that's pretty
 
06:29:56.990 --> 06:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:58.750 --> 06:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
certainly the the section on
 
06:30:03.670 --> 06:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
collaborative law is not needed in this
 
06:30:03.680 --> 06:30:08.070 align:start position:0%
collaborative law is not needed in this
statute

06:30:08.070 --> 06:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:13.030 --> 06:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
um the section for uh the appropriation
 
06:30:17.750 --> 06:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
on mental health for the police training
 
06:30:21.628 --> 06:30:21.638 align:start position:0%
standards um it seems to me that that
 
06:30:24.110 --> 06:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
might very well be in conflict with some
 
06:30:27.190 --> 06:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
of the training that already doing so I
 
06:30:29.830 --> 06:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that um motor
 
06:30:31.670 --> 06:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle records once again
 
06:30:37.390 --> 06:30:37.400 align:start position:0%
we're um casting aside the privacy of uh
 
06:30:42.830 --> 06:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
of people um these these uh it is quite
 
06:30:45.750 --> 06:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
clear that there is a desire to
 
06:30:49.548 --> 06:30:49.558 align:start position:0%
consolidate uh all of these data records
 
06:30:51.270 --> 06:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
into one
 
06:30:54.150 --> 06:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
company and uh probably resell it to
 
06:30:55.788 --> 06:30:55.798 align:start position:0%
those who want
 
06:30:59.750 --> 06:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
information and uh when we come to
 
06:31:02.070 --> 06:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
Growing Industrial Hemp I think uh
 
06:31:04.310 --> 06:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
Industrial Hemp is just a fine thing I
 
06:31:07.270 --> 06:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
don't think that we should uh be giving
 
06:31:12.670 --> 06:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
UNH a a cartel to uh hand out contracts
 
06:31:16.628 --> 06:31:16.638 align:start position:0%
for growing so for those reasons I will
 
06:31:18.388 --> 06:31:18.398 align:start position:0%
be voting
 
06:31:22.070 --> 06:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
now thank you representative
 
06:31:24.788 --> 06:31:24.798 align:start position:0%
Alexander um thank you Mr chair I do
 
06:31:26.910 --> 06:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
want to Echo um representative Sylvia's
 
06:31:28.110 --> 06:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
points I think there's a lot of good
 
06:31:30.468 --> 06:31:30.478 align:start position:0%
things um in this bill but um I think
 
06:31:32.750 --> 06:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
the bad outweighs the goods um I'm
 
06:31:35.750 --> 06:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
particularly um against non-budget
 
06:31:39.388 --> 06:31:39.398 align:start position:0%
Appropriations in the bill and um if we
 
06:31:41.230 --> 06:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
had had a full committee I think things
 
06:31:43.070 --> 06:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
would have been different but right now
 
06:31:44.510 --> 06:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
I just am not comfortable voting for
 
06:31:44.520 --> 06:31:46.708 align:start position:0%
I just am not comfortable voting for
this

06:31:46.708 --> 06:31:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:50.990 --> 06:31:51.000 align:start position:0%

is there a Minority
 
06:33:48.920 --> 06:33:50.468 align:start position:0%

yes representative Soviet will do a

06:34:06.868 --> 06:34:06.878 align:start position:0%
okay back to
 
06:34:09.708 --> 06:34:09.718 align:start position:0%
143 and I guess we can deal with Section
 
06:34:22.070 --> 06:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:24.628 --> 06:34:24.638 align:start position:0%
point I think we were at a point
 
06:34:25.910 --> 06:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative bir if I remember
 
06:34:28.030 --> 06:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
correctly that you were offering an
 
06:34:31.750 --> 06:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
amendment then comparing it
 
06:34:35.548 --> 06:34:35.558 align:start position:0%
to the other amendment I note that the
 
06:34:39.910 --> 06:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
amendment which was previously a senate
 
06:34:42.948 --> 06:34:42.958 align:start position:0%
Amendment which was provided to us by
 
06:34:47.468 --> 06:34:47.478 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson has been Rewritten
 
06:34:51.110 --> 06:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
by Services it's exact same language
 
06:35:00.350 --> 06:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:05.670 --> 06:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
3 yes thank you um and just to make sure
 
06:35:10.628 --> 06:35:10.638 align:start position:0%
we're procedurally correct I have moved
 
06:35:10.638 --> 06:35:12.350 align:start position:0%
we're procedurally correct I have moved
the

06:35:12.350 --> 06:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:35:16.510 --> 06:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
admission of uh 1267
 
06:35:21.788 --> 06:35:21.798 align:start position:0%
H um I'd like to discuss it in in
 
06:35:26.388 --> 06:35:26.398 align:start position:0%
comparison in contrast with the now
 
06:35:30.388 --> 06:35:30.398 align:start position:0%
1313 um uh amendment I don't know if
 
06:35:33.350 --> 06:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
that has to be moved in order to discuss
 
06:35:35.830 --> 06:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
them both and how the chair would want
 
06:35:35.840 --> 06:35:37.270 align:start position:0%
them both and how the chair would want
to

06:35:37.270 --> 06:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:35:37.280 --> 06:35:39.190 align:start position:0%
to
proceed

06:35:39.190 --> 06:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
06:35:41.310 --> 06:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
uh well I not sure that you can move
 
06:35:42.948 --> 06:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
them both at the same time because you
 
06:35:45.388 --> 06:35:45.398 align:start position:0%
can't vote on them both at the same time
 
06:35:48.070 --> 06:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
so I think you can feel free to compare
 
06:35:52.070 --> 06:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
it and to to the other Amendment and
 
06:35:54.830 --> 06:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
we'll go from there all right
 
06:35:57.510 --> 06:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
I do need I do need a second I and there
 
06:35:58.788 --> 06:35:58.798 align:start position:0%
may have your motion may have been
 
06:36:00.868 --> 06:36:00.878 align:start position:0%
seconded before but I it was I didn't
 
06:36:02.868 --> 06:36:02.878 align:start position:0%
write it
 
06:36:07.750 --> 06:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
down and um I will second it seconded by
 
06:36:09.750 --> 06:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative Smith go go ahead
 
06:36:09.760 --> 06:36:10.868 align:start position:0%
representative Smith go go ahead
representative

06:36:10.868 --> 06:36:10.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:36:14.830 --> 06:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
bch thank you uh as this committee uh
 
06:36:19.150 --> 06:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
more than uh well knows uh we have
 
06:36:23.510 --> 06:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
wrestled with the uh uh issue of how to
 
06:36:25.750 --> 06:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
provide better Council and better
 
06:36:28.110 --> 06:36:28.120 align:start position:0%
representation to our children who get
 
06:36:31.070 --> 06:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
involved in the Juvenile Justice System
 
06:36:35.150 --> 06:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
um and uh that resulted in a bill that
 
06:36:39.070 --> 06:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
uh went through uh house Judiciary I
 
06:36:41.670 --> 06:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
think with only one or possibly two
 
06:36:46.510 --> 06:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
objections and uh was tabled uh by the
 
06:36:50.350 --> 06:36:50.360 align:start position:0%
house uh a month or so ago uh that was a
 
06:36:54.788 --> 06:36:54.798 align:start position:0%
product of a lot of uh of by partisan
 
06:36:57.510 --> 06:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
work and the work of experts within the
 
06:37:02.948 --> 06:37:02.958 align:start position:0%
state and out of the state uh both uh um
 
06:37:05.510 --> 06:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
legislators uh attorneys who have
 
06:37:09.150 --> 06:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
experience in the family courts and
 
06:37:11.510 --> 06:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
people whove collected data and the like
 
06:37:13.750 --> 06:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of work went through it was a
 
06:37:17.468 --> 06:37:17.478 align:start position:0%
result of a report that was uh done by a
 
06:37:20.430 --> 06:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
National Organization that highlighted
 
06:37:25.430 --> 06:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh issue areas that uh uh need need work
 
06:37:28.468 --> 06:37:28.478 align:start position:0%
in this state um I'm spending a little
 
06:37:31.030 --> 06:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
time on background because I I think
 
06:37:33.830 --> 06:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's important the uh the
 
06:37:36.868 --> 06:37:36.878 align:start position:0%
major uh recommendation from the report
 
06:37:40.468 --> 06:37:40.478 align:start position:0%
was to create Specialists of lawyers
 
06:37:45.030 --> 06:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
within the uh uh defense system that
 
06:37:48.990 --> 06:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
would know uh exactly the best way and
 
06:37:51.310 --> 06:37:51.320 align:start position:0%
the best practices to represent uh
 
06:37:53.070 --> 06:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
youngsters in the juvenile justice
 
06:37:55.830 --> 06:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
system as an alternative there are a
 
06:38:01.350 --> 06:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
whole host of suggested uh um reforms of
 
06:38:03.750 --> 06:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
the 40 or 50 suggested
 
06:38:07.990 --> 06:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
reforms um we identified uh seven or
 
06:38:10.670 --> 06:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
eight and uh those resulted in the
 
06:38:14.510 --> 06:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
earlier Bill uh which has been tabled uh
 
06:38:17.468 --> 06:38:17.478 align:start position:0%
since that time uh I've engaged in
 
06:38:20.830 --> 06:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
conversation with uh people involved in
 
06:38:24.310 --> 06:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
the in the field and that has resulted
 
06:38:26.270 --> 06:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
in uh a
 
06:38:31.070 --> 06:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
proposed uh Bill an amendment to the
 
06:38:34.190 --> 06:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
Senate version the Senate has passed a
 
06:38:37.708 --> 06:38:37.718 align:start position:0%
version of
 
06:38:42.190 --> 06:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
um of Reform of council and juvenile
 
06:38:45.788 --> 06:38:45.798 align:start position:0%
cases it's part of uh
 
06:38:49.468 --> 06:38:49.478 align:start position:0%
sb43 uh I've looked at it with others
 
06:38:55.350 --> 06:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
and um basically have filed uh 126 seven
 
06:38:59.830 --> 06:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh also coming over is a uh an amendment
 
06:39:03.150 --> 06:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
uh drafted uh by Senator Carson and put
 
06:39:05.948 --> 06:39:05.958 align:start position:0%
forward today for administrative Reasons
 
06:39:09.628 --> 06:39:09.638 align:start position:0%
by representative Gordon uh which is a
 
06:39:15.468 --> 06:39:15.478 align:start position:0%
different approach so um the amendment
 
06:39:18.910 --> 06:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
that I am urging passage at this time
 
06:39:22.868 --> 06:39:22.878 align:start position:0%
1267 uh it does several things uh the
 
06:39:26.230 --> 06:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
first and most notable thing it does is
 
06:39:29.708 --> 06:39:29.718 align:start position:0%
that it uh provides earlier appointment
 
06:39:33.230 --> 06:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
of council for
 
06:39:35.230 --> 06:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
Indigent uh
 
06:39:38.310 --> 06:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
children uh one difference between this
 
06:39:40.750 --> 06:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
and what I'll call the senator Carson
 
06:39:47.350 --> 06:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
bill um is that um The Proposal that I
 
06:39:48.388 --> 06:39:48.398 align:start position:0%
am putting
 
06:39:52.310 --> 06:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
forward uh allows the court at the
 
06:39:56.310 --> 06:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
beginning when theti is filed to appoint
 
06:39:59.990 --> 06:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
Council for all children appearing or to
 
06:40:02.590 --> 06:40:02.600 align:start position:0%
to appear subject to a later
 
06:40:06.310 --> 06:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
determination if necessary about whether
 
06:40:09.030 --> 06:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh that child is financially eligible
 
06:40:12.990 --> 06:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
for um uh State's uh
 
06:40:16.388 --> 06:40:16.398 align:start position:0%
Services now the Carson bill on the
 
06:40:20.030 --> 06:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
other hand requires and it it really
 
06:40:24.110 --> 06:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
defeats the purpose re requires that the
 
06:40:26.510 --> 06:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
court shall appoint Council for an
 
06:40:29.510 --> 06:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
Indigent minor and that an Indigent
 
06:40:31.510 --> 06:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
minor shall be a minor who satisfies the
 
06:40:35.270 --> 06:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
court after appropriate inquiry um that
 
06:40:38.230 --> 06:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
the minor financially unable to obtain
 
06:40:40.910 --> 06:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
counsel this builds in a
 
06:40:44.070 --> 06:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
delay it means a court can't get a
 
06:40:46.270 --> 06:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
lawyer right off the bat which is the
 
06:40:50.590 --> 06:40:50.600 align:start position:0%
whole purpose of this particular reform
 
06:40:52.230 --> 06:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
because the court often will not have
 
06:40:54.430 --> 06:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
the information in front of it
 
06:40:57.150 --> 06:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
uh at the time the petition is filed to
 
06:40:57.160 --> 06:40:58.310 align:start position:0%
uh at the time the petition is filed to
determine

06:40:58.310 --> 06:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
determine
 
06:41:03.670 --> 06:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
indigency so um unfortunately the Carson
 
06:41:03.680 --> 06:41:04.548 align:start position:0%
indigency so um unfortunately the Carson
uh

06:41:04.548 --> 06:41:04.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:41:09.070 --> 06:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
approach uh is far more problematic if
 
06:41:10.788 --> 06:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
if you really want to get early
 
06:41:14.030 --> 06:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
appointment of council to uh to
 
06:41:17.388 --> 06:41:17.398 align:start position:0%
juveniles and to protect uh this the the
 
06:41:19.830 --> 06:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
public wallet of course the court can
 
06:41:23.110 --> 06:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
examine documents at any time and revise
 
06:41:24.708 --> 06:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
the decisions as to whether Council
 
06:41:25.750 --> 06:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
should be
 
06:41:27.750 --> 06:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
approved uh
 
06:41:32.750 --> 06:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
secondly um the next reform that hb12 67
 
06:41:37.388 --> 06:41:37.398 align:start position:0%
does is that it um permits uh
 
06:41:39.948 --> 06:41:39.958 align:start position:0%
representation of the child by
 
06:41:42.830 --> 06:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
Council um
 
06:41:45.868 --> 06:41:45.878 align:start position:0%
in proceedings that are related to the
 
06:41:48.750 --> 06:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
delinquency proceeding and when Council
 
06:41:50.670 --> 06:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
determines the participation is
 
06:41:54.510 --> 06:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
necessary to perfect to uh effective
 
06:41:57.708 --> 06:41:57.718 align:start position:0%
representation of the child and the
 
06:42:00.070 --> 06:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
second part the appointment shall remain
 
06:42:02.590 --> 06:42:02.600 align:start position:0%
in effect until the court no longer has
 
06:42:05.070 --> 06:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction taking the second part
 
06:42:07.628 --> 06:42:07.638 align:start position:0%
first such appointment shall remain in
 
06:42:09.510 --> 06:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
effect in the court until the court no
 
06:42:13.868 --> 06:42:13.878 align:start position:0%
longer has jurisdiction the uh uh the
 
06:42:18.030 --> 06:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
Carson uh Bill uh does amendment does
 
06:42:19.510 --> 06:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
not do
 
06:42:23.750 --> 06:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
that the problem is that if count
 
06:42:25.868 --> 06:42:25.878 align:start position:0%
council is representing a child it can
 
06:42:28.910 --> 06:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
often go to appeal and further
 
06:42:31.868 --> 06:42:31.878 align:start position:0%
proceedings and if you have to drop
 
06:42:33.628 --> 06:42:33.638 align:start position:0%
council at the end of one proceeding and
 
06:42:36.750 --> 06:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
get Council again and start over maybe a
 
06:42:39.590 --> 06:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
different Council maybe the same Council
 
06:42:42.948 --> 06:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
um that's not good
 
06:42:46.270 --> 06:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
representation so hb1
 
06:42:49.070 --> 06:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
1267 says that the appointment shall
 
06:42:50.230 --> 06:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
remain in
 
06:42:52.708 --> 06:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
effect until the court no longer has
 
06:42:55.110 --> 06:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so that will go through
 
06:42:58.468 --> 06:42:58.478 align:start position:0%
appeals and the like there's no reason
 
06:43:01.310 --> 06:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
that the Carson amendment gives for
 
06:43:04.468 --> 06:43:04.478 align:start position:0%
making it harder to represent children
 
06:43:06.788 --> 06:43:06.798 align:start position:0%
representation in other matters is a
 
06:43:08.750 --> 06:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
simple thing it's hard to phrase it
 
06:43:14.270 --> 06:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
right but the idea is is sometimes a I
 
06:43:16.750 --> 06:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
may be representing a child in a
 
06:43:16.760 --> 06:43:18.070 align:start position:0%
may be representing a child in a
delinquency

06:43:18.070 --> 06:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
delinquency
 
06:43:20.430 --> 06:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
proceeding and
 
06:43:22.868 --> 06:43:22.878 align:start position:0%
the somebody may want to question the
 
06:43:26.350 --> 06:43:26.360 align:start position:0%
child in a proceed a different
 
06:43:28.310 --> 06:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
proceeding where the child May
 
06:43:31.430 --> 06:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
incriminate himself or herself and that
 
06:43:33.788 --> 06:43:33.798 align:start position:0%
child may need a lawyer to say don't
 
06:43:35.430 --> 06:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
answer this question or don't answer
 
06:43:37.628 --> 06:43:37.638 align:start position:0%
that question because it's going to
 
06:43:40.430 --> 06:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
affect my representation of you in the
 
06:43:43.190 --> 06:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
delinquency case and that's the purpose
 
06:43:46.030 --> 06:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
of that it's not to have somebody
 
06:43:49.990 --> 06:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
represent a kid in an unrelated uh IEP
 
06:43:53.830 --> 06:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
case or an unrelated uh civil case or
 
06:43:55.990 --> 06:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
anything like that it's just an
 
06:43:58.990 --> 06:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
ancillary case where it may affect the
 
06:44:01.070 --> 06:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
representation in juvenile in in the
 
06:44:03.150 --> 06:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
juvenile delinquency matter that a
 
06:44:06.750 --> 06:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
lawyer can still operate again the
 
06:44:10.150 --> 06:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
Carson bill doesn't do that at all it
 
06:44:12.868 --> 06:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
just ignores that subject matter and it
 
06:44:14.110 --> 06:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
should not be
 
06:44:18.430 --> 06:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:21.948 --> 06:44:21.958 align:start position:0%
uh a a as we all will recall there was a
 
06:44:24.190 --> 06:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
debate over the issue issue of
 
06:44:27.150 --> 06:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
representing children or children should
 
06:44:29.830 --> 06:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
have lawyers at the time they are being
 
06:44:31.830 --> 06:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
interrogated or questioned by law
 
06:44:34.430 --> 06:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement or people acting in concert
 
06:44:36.548 --> 06:44:36.558 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement that became an
 
06:44:40.310 --> 06:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
issue at our last house hearing and uh I
 
06:44:43.350 --> 06:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
remember my friend from uh Windam making
 
06:44:46.628 --> 06:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
a pretty strong point about uh Miranda
 
06:44:48.468 --> 06:44:48.478 align:start position:0%
rights and whether we should expand them
 
06:44:51.830 --> 06:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
or not um there are two ways to approach
 
06:44:55.270 --> 06:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
that one is one one way which I think is
 
06:44:56.670 --> 06:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
the better
 
06:44:59.868 --> 06:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
way is to say is to establish a bright
 
06:45:01.948 --> 06:45:01.958 align:start position:0%
line rule that says children are
 
06:45:04.150 --> 06:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
different than adults children are not
 
06:45:05.510 --> 06:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
free to leave when they're being
 
06:45:07.830 --> 06:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
questioned by adults and therefore they
 
06:45:10.150 --> 06:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
should have protection that's a bright
 
06:45:13.430 --> 06:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
line it's easy for police it's easy for
 
06:45:15.750 --> 06:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
um school officials it's easy for people
 
06:45:18.910 --> 06:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
to apply it's easy for courts to
 
06:45:22.548 --> 06:45:22.558 align:start position:0%
apply that didn't uh do too well the
 
06:45:24.510 --> 06:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
last time through
 
06:45:28.270 --> 06:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
so in in respect for the arguments
 
06:45:33.030 --> 06:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
presented by some I've done the in
 
06:45:35.590 --> 06:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
1267 I've taken the more traditional
 
06:45:37.670 --> 06:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
approach that we use in adult
 
06:45:43.350 --> 06:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
court and basically said if a child is
 
06:45:43.360 --> 06:45:44.270 align:start position:0%
court and basically said if a child is
in

06:45:44.270 --> 06:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:45:47.310 --> 06:45:47.320 align:start position:0%
custody and this is how we will
 
06:45:49.510 --> 06:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
determine these factors make a
 
06:45:50.948 --> 06:45:50.958 align:start position:0%
difference in determining whether the
 
06:45:54.708 --> 06:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
child is in custody and we have that the
 
06:45:57.670 --> 06:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
child's age of maturity the duration or
 
06:46:00.750 --> 06:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
location the contact the uh existence of
 
06:46:02.948 --> 06:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
a disability the presence of the
 
06:46:04.990 --> 06:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
children's parents that the court needs
 
06:46:07.830 --> 06:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
to take those into account make findings
 
06:46:10.150 --> 06:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
of fact and then decide the custody
 
06:46:13.788 --> 06:46:13.798 align:start position:0%
question so there is a huge compromise
 
06:46:13.798 --> 06:46:15.110 align:start position:0%
question so there is a huge compromise
in

06:46:15.110 --> 06:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:46:18.150 --> 06:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
1267 uh in terms of of the objection
 
06:46:20.708 --> 06:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
that was raised in an earlier
 
06:46:25.670 --> 06:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:28.350 --> 06:46:28.360 align:start position:0%
um the other Amendment the Carson
 
06:46:31.590 --> 06:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment um skips the whole
 
06:46:36.070 --> 06:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
subject it doesn't uh it doesn't go into
 
06:46:38.990 --> 06:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
these factors during the discussion of
 
06:46:44.030 --> 06:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
sb34 part2 authorization to grow
 
06:46:47.708 --> 06:46:47.718 align:start position:0%
indust I miss that but I assume go
 
06:46:50.590 --> 06:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
ahead all right
 
06:46:54.948 --> 06:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
um so it's an important area that I
 
06:46:58.830 --> 06:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
think it should be covered and the the
 
06:47:03.910 --> 06:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
Carson Amendment just doesn't do that um
 
06:47:06.708 --> 06:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
and then there's I think just a simple
 
06:47:12.070 --> 06:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
mistake uh in the Carson Bill uh in in
 
06:47:15.868 --> 06:47:15.878 align:start position:0%
my version the Juvenile and his parents
 
06:47:18.670 --> 06:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
are not charged for
 
06:47:22.190 --> 06:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
counil the problem of course is that
 
06:47:24.468 --> 06:47:24.478 align:start position:0%
parents don't want to pay pay often for
 
06:47:26.430 --> 06:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
the kids to be represented so they don't
 
06:47:26.440 --> 06:47:28.468 align:start position:0%
the kids to be represented so they don't
get

06:47:28.468 --> 06:47:28.478 align:start position:0%
get
 
06:47:30.868 --> 06:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
represented the the
 
06:47:30.878 --> 06:47:34.868 align:start position:0%
represented the the
Carson

06:47:34.868 --> 06:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:37.830 --> 06:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
amendment has some conflicting language
 
06:47:38.910 --> 06:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
in its
 
06:47:42.708 --> 06:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
drafting in that it removes part but not
 
06:47:45.548 --> 06:47:45.558 align:start position:0%
all of the reimbursement Provisions so
 
06:47:48.510 --> 06:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
it leaves some reimbursement in but then
 
06:47:52.230 --> 06:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
it also says that instead of the current
 
06:47:55.750 --> 06:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
law this juvenile bill will uh for
 
06:47:57.788 --> 06:47:57.798 align:start position:0%
services rendered will follow the
 
06:48:01.948 --> 06:48:01.958 align:start position:0%
juvenile his entire or her entire life
 
06:48:05.590 --> 06:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
which is not what the law is
 
06:48:10.510 --> 06:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
now so on one hand it it it it would
 
06:48:13.590 --> 06:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
seem to change the reimbursement
 
06:48:16.150 --> 06:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
obligation in one section and then in
 
06:48:20.868 --> 06:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
another section it says uh that uh it it
 
06:48:22.830 --> 06:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
adds to the repayment obligation of
 
06:48:25.270 --> 06:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
famili which is the exact opposite
 
06:48:29.030 --> 06:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
direction that the experts talk about in
 
06:48:31.750 --> 06:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
fact our Juvenile Justice System the
 
06:48:35.388 --> 06:48:35.398 align:start position:0%
parents pay at pretty much every
 
06:48:38.388 --> 06:48:38.398 align:start position:0%
stage and what we decided to do in the
 
06:48:41.270 --> 06:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
working group was just talk about the
 
06:48:44.670 --> 06:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
section on getting counsel the parents
 
06:48:46.948 --> 06:48:46.958 align:start position:0%
still pay for counseling the parents
 
06:48:49.948 --> 06:48:49.958 align:start position:0%
still pay for appeals the parents still
 
06:48:51.670 --> 06:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
pay for this the parents still pay for
 
06:48:54.310 --> 06:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
that you go through a whole
 
06:48:57.150 --> 06:48:57.160 align:start position:0%
list we're just saying that it's
 
06:49:00.070 --> 06:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
important enough for these kids to get
 
06:49:02.548 --> 06:49:02.558 align:start position:0%
counil that they should be able to get
 
06:49:05.030 --> 06:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
counsel and not have the parents say
 
06:49:07.670 --> 06:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
well I I choose not to pay for that you
 
06:49:10.070 --> 06:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
know just go in there and plead guilty
 
06:49:12.910 --> 06:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
so there's some very significant details
 
06:49:15.190 --> 06:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
that are different in these two
 
06:49:19.150 --> 06:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
Provisions um all I can say is that I
 
06:49:22.750 --> 06:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
urge uh the Judiciary Committee to to
 
06:49:25.388 --> 06:49:25.398 align:start position:0%
respect back the work that has been done
 
06:49:29.190 --> 06:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
on a bipartisan basis with experts um
 
06:49:32.310 --> 06:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
and with uh lawyers with people in the
 
06:49:34.350 --> 06:49:34.360 align:start position:0%
Judiciary people with the judicial
 
06:49:37.310 --> 06:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
Council have worked hard and come up
 
06:49:38.868 --> 06:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
with a
 
06:49:41.788 --> 06:49:41.798 align:start position:0%
compromise uh piece of legislation which
 
06:49:46.430 --> 06:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
is 1267 h i semi apologize for talking
 
06:49:48.788 --> 06:49:48.798 align:start position:0%
as long as I did but this is an
 
06:49:51.030 --> 06:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
important piece of legislation and I
 
06:49:54.030 --> 06:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
want to just note in ending
 
06:49:56.270 --> 06:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh that my good friend the
 
06:49:59.310 --> 06:49:59.320 align:start position:0%
representative from Belmont earlier on a
 
06:50:02.910 --> 06:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
different Bill uh used the phrase that
 
06:50:05.030 --> 06:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
he was very paying attention to the due
 
06:50:08.868 --> 06:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
process right of citizens that he felt
 
06:50:11.310 --> 06:50:11.320 align:start position:0%
the due process rights of citizens were
 
06:50:14.910 --> 06:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
really really important and I agree
 
06:50:18.070 --> 06:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
that's why I voted for that amendment of
 
06:50:21.070 --> 06:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
his um that's what this bill is about
 
06:50:24.110 --> 06:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment is about you you have
 
06:50:27.030 --> 06:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
very powerful government on one
 
06:50:29.750 --> 06:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
side and you have citizens on the other
 
06:50:31.468 --> 06:50:31.478 align:start position:0%
and not only do you have citizens on the
 
06:50:34.910 --> 06:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
other you have the most vulnerable
 
06:50:38.270 --> 06:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
citizens on the other side
 
06:50:43.150 --> 06:50:43.160 align:start position:0%
children and the balance is way out of
 
06:50:47.830 --> 06:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
whack and it's just fundamental if you
 
06:50:50.270 --> 06:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
believe and there's many people here who
 
06:50:51.708 --> 06:50:51.718 align:start position:0%
profess it pretty
 
06:50:56.190 --> 06:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
loudly if you believe that the citizens
 
06:50:58.788 --> 06:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
of this state have a
 
06:51:02.150 --> 06:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
right to oppose the government when the
 
06:51:03.750 --> 06:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
government has done wrong or the
 
06:51:06.388 --> 06:51:06.398 align:start position:0%
government seeks to take their freedom
 
06:51:09.070 --> 06:51:09.080 align:start position:0%
away then you have to give the citizen
 
06:51:09.080 --> 06:51:10.270 align:start position:0%
away then you have to give the citizen
the

06:51:10.270 --> 06:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:51:12.990 --> 06:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
tools to be able to do
 
06:51:15.708 --> 06:51:15.718 align:start position:0%
that and one of the most effective tools
 
06:51:19.628 --> 06:51:19.638 align:start position:0%
to do that is to have a
 
06:51:22.310 --> 06:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
lawyer and that's a lot of what this
 
06:51:24.628 --> 06:51:24.638 align:start position:0%
issue is are you going to support big
 
06:51:27.270 --> 06:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
government or are you going to support
 
06:51:30.948 --> 06:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
the children who need a voice so they
 
06:51:33.510 --> 06:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
don't land up at a place like the cunu
 
06:51:37.310 --> 06:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
center and have terrible things happen
 
06:51:42.590 --> 06:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
so um uh I urge the strongest
 
06:51:47.548 --> 06:51:47.558 align:start position:0%
consideration to uh 1267 thank you
 
06:51:47.558 --> 06:51:49.628 align:start position:0%
consideration to uh 1267 thank you
representative

06:51:49.628 --> 06:51:49.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:51:52.590 --> 06:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
Alexander um thank you Mr chair um I
 
06:51:54.708 --> 06:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
just have a question for uh my friend
 
06:51:56.590 --> 06:51:56.600 align:start position:0%
from West Marland if he'll answer it for
 
06:52:00.310 --> 06:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
me I'm sure he will representative bir
 
06:52:04.190 --> 06:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
he'll do his best perfect um so this
 
06:52:06.548 --> 06:52:06.558 align:start position:0%
this is a compromise to the bill that
 
06:52:09.590 --> 06:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
was tabled um on the house floor it was
 
06:52:14.628 --> 06:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
HB 188 is that correct yes okay that's
 
06:52:17.388 --> 06:52:17.398 align:start position:0%
it thank you that's it oh
 
06:52:21.830 --> 06:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:21.840 --> 06:52:24.350 align:start position:0%
 
huh

06:52:24.350 --> 06:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
huh
 
06:52:31.190 --> 06:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:34.070 --> 06:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
bill I wouldn't I wouldn't consider it a
 
06:52:37.270 --> 06:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
compromise only I don't when they
 
06:52:40.150 --> 06:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
compromise generally you think of some
 
06:52:42.310 --> 06:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
type of an agreement to come to a
 
06:52:45.388 --> 06:52:45.398 align:start position:0%
compromise and I don't think that there
 
06:52:49.388 --> 06:52:49.398 align:start position:0%
is any agreement that I'm aware of
 
06:52:49.398 --> 06:52:51.270 align:start position:0%
is any agreement that I'm aware of
but

06:52:51.270 --> 06:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:52:53.468 --> 06:52:53.478 align:start position:0%
so I I
 
06:52:55.548 --> 06:52:55.558 align:start position:0%
first of all you should be aware that I
 
06:52:57.548 --> 06:52:57.558 align:start position:0%
worked with representative Burch to put
 
06:52:59.788 --> 06:52:59.798 align:start position:0%
together the bill in the first place and
 
06:53:01.270 --> 06:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
I'm fully supportive of all the
 
06:53:03.948 --> 06:53:03.958 align:start position:0%
provisions in the original
 
06:53:07.150 --> 06:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
Bill and most importantly the section
 
06:53:08.910 --> 06:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
which he just described at the very end
 
06:53:11.670 --> 06:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
of his speech and that is kids need to
 
06:53:11.680 --> 06:53:13.350 align:start position:0%
of his speech and that is kids need to
be

06:53:13.350 --> 06:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:53:15.510 --> 06:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
represented but there were other parts
 
06:53:18.150 --> 06:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
to that bill that we all
 
06:53:23.070 --> 06:53:23.080 align:start position:0%
know uh did not find favor and when we
 
06:53:25.590 --> 06:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
were uh in Bedford
 
06:53:29.510 --> 06:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
previously and so I'm willing to be what
 
06:53:31.388 --> 06:53:31.398 align:start position:0%
I think is and I think that's what
 
06:53:33.270 --> 06:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson was trying to be is
 
06:53:35.990 --> 06:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
politically practical here and get what
 
06:53:37.990 --> 06:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
is most important and what is most
 
06:53:41.070 --> 06:53:41.080 align:start position:0%
important is representation for
 
06:53:43.788 --> 06:53:43.798 align:start position:0%
kids and they do not have adequate
 
06:53:46.708 --> 06:53:46.718 align:start position:0%
representation today granted and I think
 
06:53:48.190 --> 06:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
everybody can get behind that and
 
06:53:51.350 --> 06:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
support it and I think we can reach a
 
06:53:54.150 --> 06:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
compromise on that but when you get into
 
06:53:56.830 --> 06:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
issues with regard to use of statements
 
06:53:59.750 --> 06:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
um then I think you're we're going to
 
06:54:00.948 --> 06:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
get into the
 
06:54:05.468 --> 06:54:05.478 align:start position:0%
same problem area that we were in in the
 
06:54:09.830 --> 06:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
past as I understand uh and as I've read
 
06:54:13.830 --> 06:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson's bill I don't a agree
 
06:54:16.708 --> 06:54:16.718 align:start position:0%
entirely uh with my colleague from West
 
06:54:19.628 --> 06:54:19.638 align:start position:0%
Morland and in that as I read the bill
 
06:54:21.548 --> 06:54:21.558 align:start position:0%
it specifically provides that
 
06:54:23.388 --> 06:54:23.398 align:start position:0%
appointment will be made
 
06:54:26.590 --> 06:54:26.600 align:start position:0%
for of council to
 
06:54:29.590 --> 06:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
juveniles no matter what it said upon
 
06:54:31.990 --> 06:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
receipt of the petition the court shall
 
06:54:34.910 --> 06:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
appoint councel for the
 
06:54:38.388 --> 06:54:38.398 align:start position:0%
mining and that appointment shall occur
 
06:54:40.708 --> 06:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
promptly in no event later than the time
 
06:54:42.388 --> 06:54:42.398 align:start position:0%
when the summons is
 
06:54:42.398 --> 06:54:44.030 align:start position:0%
when the summons is
issued

06:54:44.030 --> 06:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
issued
 
06:54:46.230 --> 06:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
and uh and notice of the appointment
 
06:54:48.270 --> 06:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
will be and so it is an immediate
 
06:54:50.788 --> 06:54:50.798 align:start position:0%
appointment there is a provision in here
 
06:54:54.110 --> 06:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
that that requires Court to make an
 
06:54:57.430 --> 06:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
inquiry with regard to whether or not
 
06:55:01.190 --> 06:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
the minor qualifies as an Indigent but
 
06:55:04.110 --> 06:55:04.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that that has to be or
 
06:55:07.270 --> 06:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be at the initiation of the
 
06:55:09.708 --> 06:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
process uh it seems to me that that
 
06:55:12.468 --> 06:55:12.478 align:start position:0%
inquiry can be made at a later date and
 
06:55:15.548 --> 06:55:15.558 align:start position:0%
in fact that happens all the time uh in
 
06:55:18.230 --> 06:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
the court where the court appoints
 
06:55:21.230 --> 06:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
attorneys to represent people only to
 
06:55:22.868 --> 06:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
have them afterwards make a
 
06:55:25.628 --> 06:55:25.638 align:start position:0%
determination as their
 
06:55:25.638 --> 06:55:27.270 align:start position:0%
determination as their
eligibility

06:55:27.270 --> 06:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
06:55:31.310 --> 06:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh the the the other parts of
 
06:55:33.750 --> 06:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
it uh this includes a very important
 
06:55:35.670 --> 06:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
part with regard to the the the
 
06:55:38.350 --> 06:55:38.360 align:start position:0%
so-called Carson Amendment which I
 
06:55:40.110 --> 06:55:40.120 align:start position:0%
sponsored at this point in time does
 
06:55:44.030 --> 06:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
indicate that andc that it changes the
 
06:55:47.150 --> 06:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
relationship between the attorneys and
 
06:55:49.110 --> 06:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
the juveniles in that in the past
 
06:55:51.150 --> 06:55:51.160 align:start position:0%
attorneys were disincentive to get
 
06:55:53.708 --> 06:55:53.718 align:start position:0%
involved or more involved the case in
 
06:55:56.350 --> 06:55:56.360 align:start position:0%
this particular case they've indicated
 
06:55:59.110 --> 06:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
that uh payment uh isn't going to be
 
06:56:01.110 --> 06:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
determined by a pre on a predetermined
 
06:56:03.150 --> 06:56:03.160 align:start position:0%
free schedule and the Carson Amendment
 
06:56:05.150 --> 06:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
provides for that and that and that is
 
06:56:08.270 --> 06:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
extremely important it doesn't provide
 
06:56:10.628 --> 06:56:10.638 align:start position:0%
for what was objectionable in the past
 
06:56:11.868 --> 06:56:11.878 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
06:56:14.948 --> 06:56:14.958 align:start position:0%
having attorneys get involved
 
06:56:18.670 --> 06:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
in proceedings that are uh may be
 
06:56:23.070 --> 06:56:23.080 align:start position:0%
related but uh but uh aren't directly
 
06:56:25.868 --> 06:56:25.878 align:start position:0%
related to what may be taking place and
 
06:56:27.830 --> 06:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
I understand that that's a shortcoming I
 
06:56:30.070 --> 06:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
certainly would like to see attorneys
 
06:56:32.830 --> 06:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
more involved in the preparations of
 
06:56:35.830 --> 06:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
IEPs for kids because these kids have in
 
06:56:35.840 --> 06:56:36.708 align:start position:0%
IEPs for kids because these kids have in
many

06:56:36.708 --> 06:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
many
 
06:56:38.910 --> 06:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
cases uh
 
06:56:43.110 --> 06:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
some uh uh disabilities that should be
 
06:56:45.788 --> 06:56:45.798 align:start position:0%
addressed in relationship to their
 
06:56:50.788 --> 06:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
prosecution uh but as uh as we indicated
 
06:56:53.468 --> 06:56:53.478 align:start position:0%
uh that found a jection on the floor of
 
06:56:57.150 --> 06:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
the house before so long and the short
 
06:56:59.510 --> 06:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
is I'm fully supportive of what
 
06:57:01.310 --> 06:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
everything that representative Birch has
 
06:57:04.468 --> 06:57:04.478 align:start position:0%
to say it's just I think the the
 
06:57:07.708 --> 06:57:07.718 align:start position:0%
amendment I've offered is the the the
 
06:57:10.190 --> 06:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
Practical alternative and it brings
 
06:57:12.270 --> 06:57:12.280 align:start position:0%
about incr what the way I'd like to view
 
06:57:14.230 --> 06:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
it is it brings about incremental change
 
06:57:16.548 --> 06:57:16.558 align:start position:0%
it gets the very most important thing
 
06:57:18.590 --> 06:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
done and that is getting representation
 
06:57:22.990 --> 06:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
for kids uh and it gets it done and then
 
06:57:24.910 --> 06:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
in the future we can deal with those
 
06:57:40.270 --> 06:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:40.280 --> 06:57:41.868 align:start position:0%
 
Improvement

06:57:41.868 --> 06:57:41.878 align:start position:0%
Improvement
 
06:57:51.310 --> 06:57:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:51.320 --> 06:58:08.750 align:start position:0%
 
comment

06:58:08.750 --> 06:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:12.070 --> 06:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:15.670 --> 06:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
proposals problem I have
 
06:58:21.310 --> 06:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:26.670 --> 06:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:45.510 --> 06:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:48.350 --> 06:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
partes I can't make out what he's saying
 
06:58:48.360 --> 06:58:51.230 align:start position:0%
partes I can't make out what he's saying
I'm

06:58:51.230 --> 06:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:51.240 --> 06:58:54.590 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

06:58:54.590 --> 06:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:56.990 --> 06:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
so the argument about how far
 
06:58:59.510 --> 06:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
representation EXs bus with the
 
06:59:01.590 --> 06:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
statement or
 
06:59:04.030 --> 06:59:04.040 align:start position:0%
statement from from the
 
06:59:08.548 --> 06:59:08.558 align:start position:0%
juvenile really is it's over my head in
 
06:59:08.558 --> 06:59:09.708 align:start position:0%
juvenile really is it's over my head in
legal

06:59:09.708 --> 06:59:09.718 align:start position:0%
legal
 
06:59:13.070 --> 06:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
terms that's all I can say about that
 
06:59:16.230 --> 06:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
it's over my head and I
 
06:59:20.230 --> 06:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
know in 188
 
06:59:22.868 --> 06:59:22.878 align:start position:0%
significant objection
 
06:59:26.070 --> 06:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
the biggest I time the biggest
 
06:59:28.990 --> 06:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
reason so it seems to me if we supp the
 
06:59:31.948 --> 06:59:31.958 align:start position:0%
full house that is not a place should go
 
06:59:37.948 --> 06:59:37.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:41.590 --> 06:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
like that uh pointed out in the Caron
 
06:59:43.788 --> 06:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
you pointed out in the Carson
 
06:59:45.910 --> 06:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
amendment I don't really see a big
 
06:59:45.920 --> 06:59:47.070 align:start position:0%
amendment I don't really see a big
conflict

06:59:47.070 --> 06:59:47.080 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
06:59:47.080 --> 06:59:48.910 align:start position:0%
conflict
between

06:59:48.910 --> 06:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
between
 
06:59:54.548 --> 06:59:54.558 align:start position:0%
uh P part of it you just don't see that
 
06:59:57.388 --> 06:59:57.398 align:start position:0%
and I think we make progress and and get
 
07:00:00.070 --> 07:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
representation for every juvenile
 
07:00:02.350 --> 07:00:02.360 align:start position:0%
immediately upon the following
 
07:00:05.190 --> 07:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
petitions and and that's the most
 
07:00:12.548 --> 07:00:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:15.190 --> 07:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
so anybody else have
 
07:00:20.868 --> 07:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:24.868 --> 07:00:24.878 align:start position:0%
do want just vote uh I have to wait a
 
07:00:27.270 --> 07:00:27.280 align:start position:0%

discussion
 
07:15:57.240 --> 07:16:00.510 align:start position:0%
discussion
well

07:16:00.510 --> 07:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:03.750 --> 07:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
I I really wanted part nine out of this
 
07:16:07.670 --> 07:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
bill unlike the part 10 and 134 which
 
07:16:10.030 --> 07:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
deals with the motor vehicle records
 
07:16:12.388 --> 07:16:12.398 align:start position:0%
which had prohibitions on sharing the
 
07:16:18.110 --> 07:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
data I think part nine with sharing uh
 
07:16:22.388 --> 07:16:22.398 align:start position:0%
the the the medical records um I I do
 
07:16:24.628 --> 07:16:24.638 align:start position:0%
think that has the potential for
 
07:16:24.638 --> 07:16:25.868 align:start position:0%
think that has the potential for
long-term

07:16:25.868 --> 07:16:25.878 align:start position:0%
long-term
 
07:16:28.270 --> 07:16:28.280 align:start position:0%
ramifications that we don't fully
 
07:16:31.590 --> 07:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
understand but I'm conflicted because we
 
07:16:35.548 --> 07:16:35.558 align:start position:0%
did add in the section on the Civil
 
07:16:35.558 --> 07:16:36.510 align:start position:0%
did add in the section on the Civil
asset

07:16:36.510 --> 07:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
asset
 
07:16:39.830 --> 07:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
for so at this point in time I don't
 
07:16:43.310 --> 07:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
know which way I'm G to go uh and I have
 
07:16:47.150 --> 07:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
to vote first so well I I just want to
 
07:16:51.070 --> 07:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
say I I share the I share the the the
 
07:16:53.948 --> 07:16:53.958 align:start position:0%
same feelings because not just part nine
 
07:16:56.750 --> 07:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
but part 10 I thought ought to come out
 
07:17:01.468 --> 07:17:01.478 align:start position:0%
of the B and and and frankly at this
 
07:17:04.548 --> 07:17:04.558 align:start position:0%
point in time I don't like part
 
07:17:07.230 --> 07:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
one I I just don't think we learned
 
07:17:10.110 --> 07:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
anything from our last go
 
07:17:10.120 --> 07:17:13.910 align:start position:0%
anything from our last go
around

07:17:13.910 --> 07:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:16.548 --> 07:17:16.558 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
07:17:19.430 --> 07:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
Alexander um thank you Mr chair I just
 
07:17:21.670 --> 07:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
um I think think that the Senate kind of
 
07:17:24.468 --> 07:17:24.478 align:start position:0%
put us in a tough spot here um with
 
07:17:26.110 --> 07:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
having to amend all these things in and
 
07:17:28.750 --> 07:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
out and I think that um you know while
 
07:17:30.468 --> 07:17:30.478 align:start position:0%
I'm happy with some things I do have to
 
07:17:32.670 --> 07:17:32.680 align:start position:0%
agree that I just I don't want to I
 
07:17:35.270 --> 07:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to encourage this um behavior
 
07:17:39.708 --> 07:17:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:42.110 --> 07:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
well representative
 
07:17:46.990 --> 07:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
Smith uh thank you um Mr chairman um I
 
07:17:48.230 --> 07:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
agree with everything that
 
07:17:52.350 --> 07:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander said accept um
 
07:17:55.468 --> 07:17:55.478 align:start position:0%
his conclusion I think that these
 
07:17:58.948 --> 07:17:58.958 align:start position:0%
Omnibus bills are an outrage I think
 
07:18:02.030 --> 07:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
they interfere with the Democratic
 
07:18:05.150 --> 07:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
process I think it makes it impossible
 
07:18:09.070 --> 07:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
for us to end up with solid legislation
 
07:18:12.150 --> 07:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
when the Senate did it last time I
 
07:18:16.910 --> 07:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
objected and um un understood that there
 
07:18:19.150 --> 07:18:19.160 align:start position:0%
might have been some problems that came
 
07:18:23.070 --> 07:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
from um the pandemic um I must tell you
 
07:18:26.030 --> 07:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
that I expected more from the president
 
07:18:28.510 --> 07:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
of the Senate because I know of his
 
07:18:30.948 --> 07:18:30.958 align:start position:0%
longstanding commitment to solid
 
07:18:34.830 --> 07:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
legislation this is a disgrace and I
 
07:18:37.670 --> 07:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
hope that we can do everything we can to
 
07:18:40.230 --> 07:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
make sure this doesn't happen again but
 
07:18:43.150 --> 07:18:43.160 align:start position:0%
I don't want to cut my nose off to spite
 
07:18:48.670 --> 07:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
my face I don't want to vote no to make
 
07:18:52.150 --> 07:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
a point
 
07:18:56.190 --> 07:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
when that means that the good parts of
 
07:18:59.350 --> 07:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
these bills don't go forward so with
 
07:19:03.868 --> 07:19:03.878 align:start position:0%
great pain and great um dissatisfaction
 
07:19:06.788 --> 07:19:06.798 align:start position:0%
in the corruption of the process I will
 
07:19:10.388 --> 07:19:10.398 align:start position:0%
vote Yes but it certainly will not be
 
07:19:13.310 --> 07:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
enthusiastically and I would ask the
 
07:19:16.430 --> 07:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
chair if there were an opportunity to
 
07:19:20.510 --> 07:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
make clear to the speaker how the
 
07:19:23.230 --> 07:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
committee feels about these bills and
 
07:19:26.070 --> 07:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
hope that the speaker might communicate
 
07:19:26.080 --> 07:19:26.990 align:start position:0%
hope that the speaker might communicate
that

07:19:26.990 --> 07:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:19:30.310 --> 07:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
distress to the Senate leadership thank
 
07:19:34.830 --> 07:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:37.190 --> 07:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
you representative Chase did I see your
 
07:19:37.200 --> 07:19:39.590 align:start position:0%
you representative Chase did I see your
hand

07:19:39.590 --> 07:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:44.670 --> 07:19:44.680 align:start position:0%
up L yep can you hear me you can you did
 
07:19:46.910 --> 07:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry I'm going to just say this
 
07:19:49.468 --> 07:19:49.478 align:start position:0%
because I'm not completely understanding
 
07:19:51.388 --> 07:19:51.398 align:start position:0%
it I think it has to do with the
 
07:19:53.350 --> 07:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
amendment that I know we already voted
 
07:19:57.310 --> 07:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
on for um Carson's and your bill which
 
07:19:58.948 --> 07:19:58.958 align:start position:0%
is now
 
07:20:02.670 --> 07:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
1267 is there any way of possibly taking
 
07:20:06.110 --> 07:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
out section five of that with the
 
07:20:10.590 --> 07:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
um the cost fees or where it doesn't
 
07:20:12.670 --> 07:20:12.680 align:start position:0%
matter okay never
 
07:20:16.590 --> 07:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
mind I'm so sorry I'm I'm okay because
 
07:20:18.388 --> 07:20:18.398 align:start position:0%
we have voted on it we cannot change it
 
07:20:19.990 --> 07:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
as I think we're we have a motion
 
07:20:24.388 --> 07:20:24.398 align:start position:0%
pending right now Bill itself okay it
 
07:20:26.190 --> 07:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter since another NE

amendment was okay never mind I'm
 
07:20:36.510 --> 07:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
