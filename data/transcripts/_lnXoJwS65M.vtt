there are two or three items that are

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
Hey sir um this is um as you said in an
 
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 align:start position:0%
oplc rule that regulates electrologists
 
00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 align:start position:0%
previously administration of these
 
00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
providers was under the Department of
 
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services but that
 
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 align:start position:0%
Administration was transferred to the
 
00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 align:start position:0%
oplc in 2015.
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
the rules um that the Department of
 
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services had an Hep
 
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
1300 expired on December 11 2017.
 
00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 align:start position:0%
so the committee may have some questions
 
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
about that there are a few other issues
 
00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 align:start position:0%
to to go through if you want I can go
 
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 align:start position:0%
ahead and start going through those and
 
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 align:start position:0%
then we can Circle back to the agency or
 
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
if you want to talk to the agency now
 
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
about the expired rules however you want
 
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
to do it sir
 
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
just go ahead you got it okay so
 
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
um besides that issue if you look on
 
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
page nine of the PDF there's just a note
 
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
there around the committee's continued
 
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 align:start position:0%
support of the executive director and
 
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
having fee Authority
 
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
there's also a note on page 12 that can
 
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
be disregarded regarding the need for
 
00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
legislation as there was a house bill
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
1062 from last session that removed um
 
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
The Authority or the requirement of this
 
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
committee to conduct the licensee
 
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
examinations that can now be done by a
 
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
third party vendor
 
00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
um and finally there there's a comment
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
on page 14 because the rule appears to
 
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 align:start position:0%
allow applicants and this is on a couple
 
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
of places in the rule to choose what fee
 
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
they want to pay
 
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 align:start position:0%
so the rule says
 
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
um the fee is 155 or whatever is in plc
 
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.749 align:start position:0%
um the fee is 155 or whatever is in plc
1002.

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 align:start position:0%
1002.
 
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
and what's noteworthy is that the form
 
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
says the the fee is 110. so there's it's
 
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
not clear what the applicant is supposed
 
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
to pay and it's not clear if the intent
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
is just to allow the applicant to choose
 
00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to pay
 
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
so um that issue also appears on another
 
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
page as well and that's in regard to the
 
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
owners of electron of these schools to
 
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.290 align:start position:0%
owners of electron of these schools to
submit

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
submit
 
00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 align:start position:0%
um to submit a fee and to submit
 
00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:27.550 align:start position:0%
um to submit a fee and to submit
information

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 align:start position:0%
that's on pages 27 and 28 and then 29
 
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
through 30.
 
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
um so there the owners can just submit
 
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
information in order to get that
 
00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:43.259 align:start position:0%
permission that license to open their
 
00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:45.129 align:start position:0%
permission that license to open their
school

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.419 align:start position:0%
oplc says there's no form for that but
 
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
it does require that the applicant
 
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
certify in a test so it's not clear how
 
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to do that the rule
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
also doesn't specify where this
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
information is sent whether that's email
 
00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:03.539 align:start position:0%
or so oplc or Etc
 
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
so and again it also says that the
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
applicant can choose what to pay and um
 
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
and there's no explanation as to what
 
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 align:start position:0%
happens if the fees are different either
 
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
in this role or over in the other 1002
 
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
rule so that's at a high level the
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Douglas
 
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
osterhout I'm General counselor for the
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
 
00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:33.539 align:start position:0%
certification as far as the fees go the
 
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:36.060 align:start position:0%
lower amount would be paid the IP for
 
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.060 align:start position:0%
this started in rule making prior to the
 
00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:43.259 align:start position:0%
PLC 1002s being in rule making so the
 
00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
specific fee was included here if it
 
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
we could revise the language to read the
 
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
renewal application processing feed
 
00:07:56.689 --> 00:07:56.699 align:start position:0%
specified in PLC 1002 if that would if
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
that would clear things up I think that
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
would I think we need to make sure that
 
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
what's on the form is the same as what's
 
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
because as I said
 
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
um the form indicates that and this is
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
on page 10
 
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:17.220 align:start position:0%
or 14 of the PDF if you're looking at
 
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:21.780 align:start position:0%
that 10 of the rule proposal it says the
 
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
form indicates the fuse 110 but then the
 
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
rule text says 115 or 155 but then it
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
says or the amount required by PLC 1002
 
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
so I think removing the application fee
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
here is fine but then we still need to
 
00:08:38.329 --> 00:08:38.339 align:start position:0%
make sure is is it the same as what's
 
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
we'll make sure the form matches I'll
 
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
work with Gretchen to make sure that
 
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.730 align:start position:0%
work with Gretchen to make sure that
happens

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
then I think
 
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.690 align:start position:0%
then I think
um

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.970 --> 00:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
I think you were going to probably hit
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
down to the other issue with the owners
 
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:02.700 align:start position:0%
and the licensing
 
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
where to submit the information I think
 
00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:11.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:16.580 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the page 28 of the
 
00:09:20.449 --> 00:09:20.459 align:start position:0%
link to documents page 24 of the fixed
 
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
text document
 
00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
it says the owner shall submit the
 
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
request but the processing fee of 375 or
 
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
the amount
 
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
established in 1002 if different
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
so again I guess maybe I think it's the
 
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
same solution we can change the language
 
00:09:39.949 --> 00:09:39.959 align:start position:0%
we can revise that to the owner she'll
 
00:09:41.449 --> 00:09:41.459 align:start position:0%
submit the request with the processing
 
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
fee established in PLC uh 1002
 
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
and I think the same solution would fix
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
both issues I think that would do it and
 
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
I think we probably need another
 
00:09:55.329 --> 00:09:55.339 align:start position:0%
um paragraph in this section and this is
 
00:09:58.009 --> 00:09:58.019 align:start position:0%
708.03 we need another paragraph in
 
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
there that tells the applicants where to
 
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
submit this information
 
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
I'll work with Gretchen on that and then
 
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
we need to know too how the applicant
 
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
can submit a certification statement
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
so I guess maybe just needs to spell
 
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
that out a little bit more clearly in
 
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
the rule so we're just looking for
 
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.009 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:10:25.009 --> 00:10:25.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
about the fact that the Rule's been
 
00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:32.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't have a lot of
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
history on that I only started in
 
00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:40.019 align:start position:0%
January and as soon as the rules came
 
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
over to oplc and they became an Advisory
 
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:45.240 align:start position:0%
Board we started drafting rules to get
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
uh can I ask what you've been doing in
 
00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
over the last five years regarding you
 
00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
know fees and applications and licenses
 
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:03.899 align:start position:0%
do you have any history of course yeah I
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
wasn't expecting that question I can do
 
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
some research and I can get you an
 
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
answer but I don't have an answer for
 
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
now I do know executive director
 
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.610 align:start position:0%
now I do know executive director
Courtney

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
Courtney
 
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
um makes it a point not to collect fees
 
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
that she doesn't have the authority to
 
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
do so
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I move we object to the rule
 
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:35.220 align:start position:0%
on the grounds of Staff comments and
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
invite you to submit a corrective a
 
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
corrective app
 
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
proposal and also provide a report on
 
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.389 align:start position:0%
proposal and also provide a report on
the

00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:47.449 --> 00:11:47.459 align:start position:0%
activities since the previous rules
 
00:11:47.459 --> 00:11:53.090 align:start position:0%
activities since the previous rules
expired

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I also have another
 
00:11:56.889 --> 00:11:56.899 align:start position:0%
request with that
 
00:11:59.630 --> 00:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
fees support activity and they're
 
00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
directed to that activity and there's
 
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
parameters that they have to stay within
 
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
and that's why those fees exist
 
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
you need authorization to charge the
 
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.370 align:start position:0%
you need authorization to charge the
fees

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
so here's here's my question I need to
 
00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:13.970 align:start position:0%
so here's here's my question I need to
know

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
the mechanisms that were utilized to
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
fund this activity
 
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
this is important and it has to be very
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
clear and explicit and if the fees were
 
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
not collected
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
what monies were utilized
 
00:12:33.769 --> 00:12:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
because again the department had zero
 
00:12:36.899 --> 00:12:38.509 align:start position:0%
because again the department had zero
Authority

00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:38.519 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:41.220 align:start position:0%
to assess fees they had zero authority
 
00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:43.139 align:start position:0%
to actually do anything around the
 
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
Realms of this activity
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
and and that's the seriousness that this
 
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
has to be held so
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
um am I clear in in what I would be
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
expecting yes sir so I want to repeat it
 
00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
back to you to make sure thank you
 
00:12:59.449 --> 00:12:59.459 align:start position:0%
um mechanisms that are utilized to fund
 
00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
activities and if fees were not
 
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:04.740 align:start position:0%
collected what fees were utilized if in
 
00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
fact the fees were not collected correct
 
00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
and if they were collected I need to
 
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
know an accounting not that if that's
 
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chairman I will gladly accept
 
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:17.820 align:start position:0%

any other discussion or questions from
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:52.019 align:start position:0%
and we'll see Representatives show it
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%

okay
um

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
this uh proposal makes changes to the
 
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
Alcohol and Other Drug use professional
 
00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
rules the agency has filed a conditional
 
00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
approval request which has resolved all
 
00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
the issues there is just one issue and
 
00:14:41.329 --> 00:14:41.339 align:start position:0%
that is related to the fact that the
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
rules have been expired since 2017.
 
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.490 align:start position:0%
rules have been expired since 2017.
foreign

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.269 align:start position:0%
 
McGuire

00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:59.329 --> 00:14:59.339 align:start position:0%
yes so even though these rules were
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
expired we relied on the
 
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
um the Department of Justice rules is
 
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
that what it was for laid out so that
 
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
there's uh rules Jus 800s which allow us
 
00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.050 align:start position:0%
there's uh rules Jus 800s which allow us
to

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:15:14.569 --> 00:15:14.579 align:start position:0%
um hold their sort of Gap filler
 
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
catch-all for uh educated hearings under
 
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:19.980 align:start position:0%
administrative boards
 
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
oh sure uh
 
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
I was saying the Justice 800s are can be
 
00:15:28.129 --> 00:15:28.139 align:start position:0%
used as they can be used as sort of Gap
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
filler for administrative hearings in
 
00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
the event that something uh like latex
 
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
rules would lapse uh now currently
 
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
there's also the PLC 200s which went
 
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
into effect early August August 4th or
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
August 8th I'm not sure
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
if you have two sets of rules governing
 
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
this why are you putting up a third set
 
00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
the the rules for oplc are
 
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
intended to be covered the
 
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.030 align:start position:0%
intended to be covered the
uh

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
a couple of reasons
 
00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:07.019 align:start position:0%
are meant to cover the
 
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
advisory boards who wouldn't have rules
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
uh we're hoping in an effort to
 
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
streamline the system to eventually get
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of boards to adapt the 200 some of
 
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
those committees have already done that
 
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
I believe acupuncture has made a motion
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
to do that Midwifery has decided to go
 
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
in that direction and they're also used
 
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
there's language in there that they're
 
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
meant to supplement rules and not uh
 
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
circumvent or oversee so if there are
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
rules in the individual committees they
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
can also be used
 
00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:51.170 align:start position:0%
can also be used
foreign

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
would it help if I provided an example
 
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
okay so there's there's and a lot of the
 
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
statutes there's there'll be reference
 
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
to say an emergency suspension where we
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
a board can take action against a
 
00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:08.339 align:start position:0%
licensee but they have to have a hearing
 
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
within 10 days and those are in
 
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
emergency situations what we were
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
finding was a lot of the rule sets while
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
they may have it in statute didn't have
 
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
specific rules to address how an
 
00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:20.339 align:start position:0%
emergency hearing the timing those types
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
of things would occur so the PLC 200s
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
and that's based on
 
00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:37.460 align:start position:0%
the plcr no RSA 310
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
A1 d
 
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral two H2
 
00:17:45.049 --> 00:17:45.059 align:start position:0%
which gives us the authority to
 
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
promulgate rules for those types of
 
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:55.909 align:start position:0%
promulgate rules for those types of
processes

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.919 --> 00:18:06.049 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:06.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:08.039 align:start position:0%
um so what is the difference between
 
00:18:08.039 --> 00:18:09.409 align:start position:0%
um so what is the difference between
these

00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:09.419 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
these rules and the oplc rules are these
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
more detailed are they more focused on
 
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
these sections across all of them
 
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
uh Tina Kelly
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
um program specialist with the office of
 
00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:34.340 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
these rules um are pretty much the same
 
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
across the various boards and
 
00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
um so they're pretty standard rules that
 
00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:45.559 align:start position:0%
are used and I'm and I'm guessing that
 
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
oplc has the same standard of rules they
 
00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:51.539 align:start position:0%
might be worded a little bit different
 
00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%
if they do the same thing why duplicate
 
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
and energy
 
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
go ahead mom
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
so maybe it'd be beneficial just to
 
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
speak briefly very briefly because this
 
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
is an ongoing issue and it needs to be
 
00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.310 align:start position:0%
is an ongoing issue and it needs to be
rectified

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
rectified
 
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:19.970 align:start position:0%
rectified
um

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard the causation for the
 
00:19:24.169 --> 00:19:24.179 align:start position:0%
lack of the rules being submitted in a
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
timely manner so is that a process
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
problem or what is the problem to that
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
Personnel problem and and maybe if you
 
00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
could I'm sorry to go on but explain the
 
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
process now does these rules go to like
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
the governor's Council of alcohol and
 
00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
drugs first and they have to go through
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
and and agree on said set of rules or
 
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
what is the process for that and where
 
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
are we getting tripped up and and if it
 
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
can be done in a very short period of
 
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
time and with the chairs indulgent could
 
00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
we do that and that might help us
 
00:20:00.529 --> 00:20:00.539 align:start position:0%
um so what has happened is we we went
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
back and we identified through all the
 
00:20:06.049 --> 00:20:06.059 align:start position:0%
boards which rules were expiring which
 
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
rules are going to expire that process
 
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
has been now put into place what we're
 
00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
doing right now is trying to get
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
everything caught up so as soon as all
 
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
these expired rules are caught up and we
 
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
have them adopted there's a system now
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
in place so that this will not happen
 
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
down the road
 
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
thank you that's what I was looking for
 
00:20:30.289 --> 00:20:30.299 align:start position:0%
and and thank you for that yes that I
 
00:20:33.049 --> 00:20:33.059 align:start position:0%
still have the question of even if the
 
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
op the specific
 
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.750 align:start position:0%
op the specific
alcohol

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
procedural rules were expired the fact
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
that you've got
 
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice rules and oplc
 
00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
rules that cover the activities
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
why are you bothering with to put these
 
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
through instead of just referencing the
 
00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
oplc rules
 
00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.510 align:start position:0%
oplc rules
so

00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's my understanding that all
 
00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
aboards have had these in place and the
 
00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.770 align:start position:0%
aboards have had these in place and the
boards

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
um determine are the ones determining
 
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.770 align:start position:0%
um determine are the ones determining
um

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
legal issues within their specific
 
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
boards and that what oplc is trying to
 
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
do is to work with the boards
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
individually to have them if they choose
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
move over to oplcs then these would be
 
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
revised to just refer to oplc's rules
 
00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:34.460 align:start position:0%
they're trying to work collaboratively
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
with the boards
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
so there's buy it
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
could I um
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
so I mean just for clarity why there is
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
an additional set of rules the ones that
 
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
are out of the oplc are the different
 
00:21:51.649 --> 00:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
boards such as the alcohol board are
 
00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
more explicit but you're using the 200
 
00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:57.860 align:start position:0%
authority to
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
adjudicate things under those more
 
00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
explicit rules provided by the boards is
 
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
that not correct so there isn't a
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
duplication of verbiage the rules
 
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
are defined a little differently within
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
or more explicitly within the different
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
boards than the 200 rules is that not
 
00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
correct there's it's not a duplication
 
00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
per se and they're using the 200 rules
 
00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
to authorize them to adjudicate under
 
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
these explicit the explicit verbiage
 
00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
from the different boards is that a
 
00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:33.059 align:start position:0%
correct scenario is that what we're
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
looking for I think yes I think so I
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
think so and there's right there's a
 
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
question of uh ease for for the user too
 
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
on the end so they can go right to their
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
rules they can look at those statutes
 
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
and if there was something that wasn't
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
addressed in their rules that's where
 
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
they might turn to the Justice 800s in
 
00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
the past now they might turn to the PLC
 
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
200s to sort of supplement the thing
 
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
they know the thing they're comfortable
 
00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
with and as Tina pointed out we are
 
00:23:00.049 --> 00:23:00.059 align:start position:0%
working with the boards to try and get
 
00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
everyone to adopt eventually that's a
 
00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
long-term goal we'll see how it goes
 
00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman Mr chairman yes I think Kim
 
00:23:12.169 --> 00:23:12.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
just going to point out the uh the
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
statute that oplc is referring to is 310
 
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.730 align:start position:0%
statute that oplc is referring to is 310
a1-d

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
so that is titled administration of the
 
00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
certification specifically H2 talks
 
00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
about what grants them Authority it says
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
such organization and procedural rules
 
00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:37.799 align:start position:0%
necessary to administer the board's
 
00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
commissions councils and programs in the
 
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
office including rules governing the
 
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
administration of complaints and
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
investigations hearings disciplinary
 
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
proceedings Payment Processing
 
00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:49.460 align:start position:0%
procedures and application procedures
 
00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
the boards shall retain the authority to
 
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
determine the criteria necessary for
 
00:23:57.289 --> 00:23:57.299 align:start position:0%
licensing applications so that seems to
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.679 --> 00:24:04.070 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.669 align:start position:0%
yep
Diane

00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
oh I tend to agree with representative
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
McGuire I I'm not sure I see the need
 
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
for two sets
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.169 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:24:27.169 --> 00:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
so we still need a motion to approve the
 
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.730 align:start position:0%
so we still need a motion to approve the
rule

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:33.529 --> 00:24:33.539 align:start position:0%
so move
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
motion by hatch second by
 
00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.390 align:start position:0%
motion by hatch second by
e

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
e
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
so I can buy Schmidt
 
00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
we have three opposed
 
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
Board of veterinary medicine
 
00:25:09.169 --> 00:25:09.179 align:start position:0%
yes sir um this proposal also makes
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
changes to the rules on the practice of
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
veterinarian medicine I don't have any
 
00:25:18.169 --> 00:25:18.179 align:start position:0%
substantive comments just as the the um
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
the rule set that we heard before these
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
rules have been expired since 2020 so
 
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:26.700 align:start position:0%
the committee may want to ask some
 
00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:33.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
so I know for this one there was a
 
00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:38.039 align:start position:0%
mistake oplc received
 
00:25:38.039 --> 00:25:39.070 align:start position:0%
mistake oplc received
um

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
fees for renewals last year but we are
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
in the process of refunding those rules
 
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
we have not been collecting fees for
 
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
initial licensure since then renewals
 
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
happen every December so the renewal
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
piece hasn't been an issue since last
 
00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
year uh I found out about this January
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
February after I started we made it a
 
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
priority to get all the vet board rules
 
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
moving forward as far as discipline goes
 
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
the there was only one disciplinary
 
00:26:09.049 --> 00:26:09.059 align:start position:0%
action again we could rely on the
 
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
Justice 800 rules and that was a
 
00:26:15.169 --> 00:26:15.179 align:start position:0%
violation of Statute we were still able
 
00:26:18.289 --> 00:26:18.299 align:start position:0%
to issue licenses renewals and initial
 
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
licenses because the statutory there's
 
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority that allows the oplc
 
00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:24.059 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so the committee is aware
 
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
until recently the veterinary rules were
 
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
under uh the Department of Agriculture
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
and they have now moved over to Opel
 
00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.789 align:start position:0%
and they have now moved over to Opel
okay

00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:00.769 --> 00:27:00.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.169 --> 00:27:06.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
send me
 
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry uh
 
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
unless the staff objects that would be
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
for all three sets of rules so to
 
00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:19.559 align:start position:0%
clarify that would be for
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
um well you just yes it would be for 89
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions or discussion
 
00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:38.039 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
this is to approve
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
c d and e all three rules all those in
 
00:27:43.559 --> 00:27:48.890 align:start position:0%
c d and e all three rules all those in
favor

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:51.179 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could just have uh something
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
from the agriculture Department to
 
00:27:57.649 --> 00:27:57.659 align:start position:0%
provide the links I understand the carry
 
00:28:00.289 --> 00:28:00.299 align:start position:0%
forward from agriculture department and
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
so forth to oplc but I think we have to
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
have something you know in writing that
 
00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:07.100 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
reads to that effect
 
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
if I could please um the motion on 490
 
00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:18.779 align:start position:0%
should be conditionally approved there
 
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
was a conditional approval request for
 
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
that proposal
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
any further discussion from the
 
00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.029 align:start position:0%
any further discussion from the
committee

00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:45.500 align:start position:0%
this proposal was conditionally approved
 
00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
by the committee in July and it was
 
00:28:51.649 --> 00:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
based on the agency's conditional
 
00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
approval request but the response made a
 
00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
number of amendments which were not part
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
of the conditional approval request many
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
of the amendments are editorial some of
 
00:29:05.169 --> 00:29:05.179 align:start position:0%
them are not annotated
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of substantive
 
00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:10.919 align:start position:0%
changes that could be argued either as
 
00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
substantive or editorial if you look on
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
page six there is the deletion of a fee
 
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
but a couple of sub paragraphs before it
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
is a citation to that same fee so that's
 
00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
why that has been deleted
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
um and then there's an insertion of the
 
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
word broker in quite a few places
 
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
it sounds like this was part of cleanup
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
by the board after the fact and then
 
00:29:41.769 --> 00:29:41.779 align:start position:0%
there's a new requirement
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
granting permission that if a person
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
grants permission that um that uh a
 
00:29:51.769 --> 00:29:51.779 align:start position:0%
personal email address can be can be
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
used and that's on page seven so
 
00:29:57.889 --> 00:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
um again I have no other comments other
 
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
than just to give you a high level
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
summary of the changes that were made
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
that were not included in the
 
00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:16.340 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
yes thank you do I understand you
 
00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
correctly that the objection response
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
has what would it would generate no
 
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
objections yes ma'am I think it could be
 
00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
argued um as I said one way or or the
 
00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
other that these changes on page seven
 
00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
of the um of the PDF
 
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
I believe that that sentence was
 
00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
actually in the role further up the road
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
if you will I think in the final
 
00:30:48.529 --> 00:30:48.539 align:start position:0%
proposal but it gotten moved out so it's
 
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
in here now
 
00:30:51.529 --> 00:30:51.539 align:start position:0%
um some of the other changes appear to
 
00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
be cleanup
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
um I think Tina can speak to why the
 
00:30:57.889 --> 00:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
board chose this moment to um to make
 
00:30:59.690 --> 00:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
these changes instead of having them in
 
00:31:01.789 --> 00:31:01.799 align:start position:0%
the conditional approval request at the
 
00:31:01.799 --> 00:31:05.029 align:start position:0%
the conditional approval request at the
outset

00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:07.980 align:start position:0%
go ahead hi Tina Kelly program
 
00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
specialist oplc
 
00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
um I I brought it to the board I
 
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
explained to them what would happen if
 
00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:16.980 align:start position:0%
they made these changes and that they
 
00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:20.039 align:start position:0%
were and to only do it if it was
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
imperative they felt that it was
 
00:31:24.049 --> 00:31:24.059 align:start position:0%
imperative they knew that they would it
 
00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
would result in a preliminary objection
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
response and they were adamant that
 
00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
these be changed for clarity's sake and
 
00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
the correctness of the rules
 
00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.049 align:start position:0%
the correctness of the rules
um

00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:37.740 align:start position:0%
they've been working on them they've
 
00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:40.740 align:start position:0%
made more changes over time
 
00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
why they waited to this moment to make
 
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
these few changes
 
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
I I can't answer to that they they just
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:58.140 align:start position:0%
sir if I I could too
 
00:32:00.049 --> 00:32:00.059 align:start position:0%
um is just come to my attention that the
 
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
committee didn't vote on the three vet
 
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
rules I think the Motions were made but
 
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
no voting actually took place
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
yeah we voted oh we got
 
00:32:18.529 --> 00:32:18.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:18.539 --> 00:32:21.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
sorry Mike was thinking that we hadn't
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
I moved to approve
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
these rules
 
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.470 align:start position:0%
 
second

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
motion by McGuire second by Lang
 
00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:48.889 align:start position:0%
motion by McGuire second by Lang
discussion

00:32:48.889 --> 00:32:48.899 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none all those in favor
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:05.039 --> 00:33:28.610 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair there were a number of
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
comments on this particular rule the
 
00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.450 align:start position:0%
comments on this particular rule the
2020

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:34.460 align:start position:0%
2020
 
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:37.380 align:start position:0%
2022 114
 
00:33:39.289 --> 00:33:39.299 align:start position:0%
um however just so the committee is
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
aware the agency did reach out with a
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request past the
 
00:33:44.279 --> 00:33:45.649 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request past the
deadline

00:33:45.649 --> 00:33:45.659 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
um and so I
 
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
know um I did did initial review of that
 
00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
as it does need a waiver so I couldn't
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
submit it as an actual conditional
 
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.610 align:start position:0%
submit it as an actual conditional
approval

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
approval
 
00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:56.210 align:start position:0%
approval
um

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:56.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:58.009 --> 00:33:58.019 align:start position:0%
and if the agency would like to request
 
00:33:59.930 --> 00:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
a waiver at this time then perhaps we
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
could discuss that first as it does take
 
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:05.100 align:start position:0%
care of a number of the comments okay so
 
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
you need a motion
 
00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
for the waiver so move tools
 
00:34:13.129 --> 00:34:13.139 align:start position:0%
motion by length second by Schmidt all
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
00:34:14.399 --> 00:34:17.810 align:start position:0%
those in favor
aye

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
um so the remaining comments that are on
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
this particular rule the first is on
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
page one it's just a note to the
 
00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:29.220 align:start position:0%
committee that this particular agency
 
00:34:32.169 --> 00:34:32.179 align:start position:0%
does have an exemption from RSA
 
00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:34.010 align:start position:0%
does have an exemption from RSA
541a

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
541a
 
00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
for its forms they do not have to be
 
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:38.940 align:start position:0%
incorporated by reference do not need
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
addition dates and maybe changed outside
 
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
of the RSA 501a process however there
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
were still a couple comments with regard
 
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
to the forums outside of these
 
00:34:51.649 --> 00:34:51.659 align:start position:0%
parameters the first
 
00:34:54.369 --> 00:34:54.379 align:start position:0%
is that a number of the forms
 
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
ask that they be signed under the
 
00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.430 align:start position:0%
ask that they be signed under the
penalties

00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:00.500 align:start position:0%
of perjury
 
00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
specifically form CD 57p which is on
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
page first referenced on page two
 
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
cd57 s also on page 2 CD 57 hcp also on
 
00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:17.900 align:start position:0%
page two
 
00:35:25.089 --> 00:35:25.099 align:start position:0%
cd57 HCS also on page 2 of the rule
 
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
dp151 which appears on pages five and
 
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
six five and sixteen of the rule CD 92
 
00:35:34.609 --> 00:35:34.619 align:start position:0%
which appear on page 7 and 15 of the
 
00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
rule Au 202 page 10 of the rule Au 201
 
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
page 13 of the rule in dp8 which appears
 
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
on page 18 of the rule the agency has
 
00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:50.660 align:start position:0%
provided the explanation that RSA
 
00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:53.579 align:start position:0%
21j392d provides them with broad
 
00:35:56.089 --> 00:35:56.099 align:start position:0%
authority to use penalties of perjury on
 
00:35:57.069 --> 00:35:57.079 align:start position:0%
their form
 
00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:00.300 align:start position:0%
however staff disagrees with this
 
00:36:02.569 --> 00:36:02.579 align:start position:0%
analysis of the statute the statutory
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
language specifically is with respect to
 
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
any tax administered by the department
 
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
no person shall willfully make And
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
subscribe any return report statement or
 
00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
other document that contains or is
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
verified by a written declaration that
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
is made under the penalties of perjury
 
00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:26.339 align:start position:0%
and that he does not believe to be true
 
00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
and correct as to every material matter
 
00:36:32.329 --> 00:36:32.339 align:start position:0%
the staff would argue that this language
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
is stating that no person shall provide
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
misleading or incorrect information on a
 
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
form that already contains the
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
Declaration it does not give permission
 
00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:45.180 align:start position:0%
for the Declaration to be included on
 
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
all forms and this is further supported
 
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
by the fact that a number of the other
 
00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
forms included with this rule have
 
00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:54.839 align:start position:0%
statutes that specifically allow them to
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
be signed under the pains and penalties
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
of perjury
 
00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
specifically the forms that relate to
 
00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:04.859 align:start position:0%
the tobacco tax RSA 7842 specifically
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
says the commissioner shall adopt rules
 
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
pursuant to our say 541a relative to the
 
00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:13.140 align:start position:0%
form of such return in the data
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
which it must contain for the correct
 
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
computation of tobacco tax attributable
 
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
to the state the consumer shall sign the
 
00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
return subject to the pains and
 
00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
penalties of perjury this is also found
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
in RSA 8210 1A which is under the
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
taxation of railroads and similarly
 
00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:38.540 align:start position:0%
similarly under RSA 83 F5 which
 
00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
also has the statement
 
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:41.750 align:start position:0%
also has the statement
um

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:43.849 --> 00:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall require and shall be
 
00:37:47.329 --> 00:37:47.339 align:start position:0%
signed by an authorized representative
 
00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
subject to the pains and penalties of
 
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.990 align:start position:0%
subject to the pains and penalties of
perjury

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
perjury
 
00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:53.940 align:start position:0%
the additional comments that I have for
 
00:37:56.329 --> 00:37:56.339 align:start position:0%
this particular rule
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
um is on page two of the rule page eight
 
00:38:04.089 --> 00:38:04.099 align:start position:0%
of the packet under Revenue
 
00:38:07.609 --> 00:38:07.619 align:start position:0%
809.05 those forms
 
00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:08.690 align:start position:0%
809.05 those forms
um

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:12.140 align:start position:0%
that are listed in that particular rule
 
00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
are forms that are the Declaration of
 
00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:18.980 align:start position:0%
consideration and the statute
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
regarding the Declaration of
 
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
consideration forms RSA 78 b101a does
 
00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:26.270 align:start position:0%
consideration forms RSA 78 b101a does
have

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:38:28.609 --> 00:38:28.619 align:start position:0%
specific statutory language it requires
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
on the form and the forms seem to admit
 
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
part of that statutory language
 
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
specifically the agree and affirm that
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
the full price or consideration for the
 
00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:41.820 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer is x amount of
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
dollars instead the form State I declare
 
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
that I've examined this return to the
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
best of my belief it is true correct and
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
complete staff would argue that these
 
00:38:53.089 --> 00:38:53.099 align:start position:0%
are two very different requirements and
 
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
therefore the agree and affirm should be
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
added to that particular form
 
00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:00.660 align:start position:0%
the next comment is on page four of the
 
00:39:03.849 --> 00:39:03.859 align:start position:0%
rule page 10 of the packet under Revenue
 
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
1002.01 e the agency uses the word
 
00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
sufficient to describe the number of
 
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
stamps purchased
 
00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
um and though this is the same language
 
00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
that is used in the statute under RSA
 
00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:20.829 align:start position:0%
that is used in the statute under RSA
541a1

00:39:20.829 --> 00:39:20.839 align:start position:0%
541a1
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
5 the rules are meant to interpret or
 
00:39:26.329 --> 00:39:26.339 align:start position:0%
make clear the statute so the word
 
00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:29.099 align:start position:0%
sufficient is a bit vague and should be
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
clarified further so that the wholesaler
 
00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
knows exactly how many stamps they need
 
00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:35.660 align:start position:0%
to keep on hand in order not to be
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
penalized by the agency
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh the next
 
00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.170 align:start position:0%
uh the next
comment

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.690 align:start position:0%
comment
um

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:47.220 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
I apologize the rest of the comments are
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
addressed on the agency's conditional
 
00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:52.140 align:start position:0%
approval request
 
00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.150 align:start position:0%
approval request
um

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
for changes so that's all the comments
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
staff have at this time
 
00:40:02.089 --> 00:40:02.099 align:start position:0%
so what do we recommend to do about this
 
00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
uh I would recommend uh Mr chair that
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
the committee conditionally approve this
 
00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:11.220 align:start position:0%
rule with the
 
00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.310 align:start position:0%
rule with the
um

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
with an amendment to the already
 
00:40:17.329 --> 00:40:17.339 align:start position:0%
submitted conditional approval that the
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
forms that require under pains the
 
00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.349 align:start position:0%
forms that require under pains the
kernel

00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:20.359 align:start position:0%
kernel
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
under the penalties of perjury uh
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
language be changed as they don't have
 
00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
the statutory authority to include that
 
00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:28.859 align:start position:0%
on their forms
 
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
um that the form that requires the
 
00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
statutory language be also amended to
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
include the affirm
 
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
um language in the statute and that's
 
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
the agency changed the word sufficient
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
to be clearer and more defined on what
 
00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
number of stamps they wholesaler needs
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
to include under the rules
 
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
so we don't see a need for a statutory
 
00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.990 align:start position:0%
so we don't see a need for a statutory
change

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
um regarding the perjury issue RSA 641
 
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
one through three uh sets penalties for
 
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
um making false statements
 
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
641-1 is perjury which is a criminal
 
00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
penalty 641 2 and 3 are less of
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
penalties they're violations it's been
 
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
the long-standing position of Staff in
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
the committee itself that you cannot use
 
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
a rule to impose a criminal criminal
 
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
penalty unless you have specific
 
00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:37.700 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority all right
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
so I I guess if I may Mr chair
 
00:41:42.589 --> 00:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
um before I make a motion though could
 
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
the department respond to what
 
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
um they need to do to address this and
 
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
the severity of it I guess thank you
 
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
good morning of the Department of
 
00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.270 align:start position:0%
good morning of the Department of
Revenue

00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
so we we did look into this and uh we
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
did consider the the issues that was
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
pointed out by uh OLS staff and we do
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
find that we are operating within the
 
00:42:09.609 --> 00:42:09.619 align:start position:0%
confines of the statutory language
 
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
specifically these uh on the forms and
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
the forms are exempt from um
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
541-a requirements this is stated in the
 
00:42:21.119 --> 00:42:22.569 align:start position:0%
541-a requirements this is stated in the
RSA

00:42:22.569 --> 00:42:22.579 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
541-8215 Roman 5 and um in in our dra
 
00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:30.020 align:start position:0%
statute as well RSA 21
 
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
j13-a and just to give some background
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
on what I found on the uh on the history
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
legislative history of these statutes so
 
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
the exemption of the ra forms from um
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
the 541a requirement started in
 
00:42:48.119 --> 00:42:49.370 align:start position:0%
the 541a requirement started in
um

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
in 1996 so that require that statue
 
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
enacted in 1996
 
00:42:58.670 --> 00:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
exams the business profits tax forms bad
 
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:02.220 align:start position:0%
forms and IND forms specifically from
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
the 541a requirement and then 14 years
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
later in 2010 uh statutory
 
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
um legislation expanded that exemption
 
00:43:14.089 --> 00:43:14.099 align:start position:0%
to all dra forms
 
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
um and with that we feel that um
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
we are still acting within the the
 
00:43:23.089 --> 00:43:23.099 align:start position:0%
authority of the statute
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
and also just to add to that dra's
 
00:43:28.849 --> 00:43:28.859 align:start position:0%
functions and so the array is charged
 
00:43:28.859 --> 00:43:30.130 align:start position:0%
functions and so the array is charged
under

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:30.140 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
21j12 to oversee the collections of of
 
00:43:35.809 --> 00:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
state taxes as well as to provide
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
information collected through Tax
 
00:43:38.809 --> 00:43:38.819 align:start position:0%
Administration to governor and general
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
counsel for Public Policy decisions and
 
00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
it's really imperative that we are able
 
00:43:46.609 --> 00:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
to really rely on the information that
 
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
we receive from from filers that it's
 
00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:53.220 align:start position:0%
accurate and that that we can be able to
 
00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:56.460 align:start position:0%
provide this service to to governor and
 
00:43:58.250 --> 00:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
general counsel
 
00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:59.150 align:start position:0%
general counsel
um

00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
and it's also imperative that for us to
 
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
be able to rely on that so on the flip
 
00:44:05.569 --> 00:44:05.579 align:start position:0%
side that the people who are following
 
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
this information should be accountable
 
00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
for that information as well
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of the statutory
 
00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.230 align:start position:0%
in terms of the statutory
um

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:15.660 align:start position:0%
the legislative um Century Authority as
 
00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
well is that um as mentioned by OLS
 
00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
staff there's a rc21 j39 2d
 
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
the way we read it is that it allows us
 
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
to prove to have that level of a
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
taxation on
 
00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
on the on all the forms on all our dra
 
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.230 align:start position:0%
on the on all the forms on all our dra
forms

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
forms
 
00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
and also their um legislature has also
 
00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
recognized that that it's important for
 
00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
us that the level of information that we
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
provide is accurate so it also
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
provides the commission with authority
 
00:44:52.609 --> 00:44:52.619 align:start position:0%
to summon the production of papers and
 
00:44:56.089 --> 00:44:56.099 align:start position:0%
documents bring into any Tax Matters uh
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
which the commercial which the
 
00:44:58.370 --> 00:44:58.380 align:start position:0%
commissioner has authority to
 
00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:00.260 align:start position:0%
investigate and that's in
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
21j3 Roman 9.
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
um and also we will we also
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
make reference to um
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
the the criminal and you have your
 
00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
criminal code AS mentioned by um uh OLS
 
00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:17.220 align:start position:0%
staff as well
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
um in regards to why some of the um some
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
of the statues some of the operating
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
statutes has specific language for
 
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.109 align:start position:0%
statutes has specific language for
um

00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
or the pains and pains of penalties of
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
perjury while some statutes do not
 
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.010 align:start position:0%
perjury while some statutes do not
um

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
I can only submit that it is likely that
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
um that legislature probably saw that
 
00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
the inconsistencies in in those
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
different statutes and might have that
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
might resolve it through the requirement
 
00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
to say okay yes allowing the forms to be
 
00:45:54.589 --> 00:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
governed under the more overarching
 
00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
umbrella of the 21j statute
 
00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
and therefore require imposing a more
 
00:46:02.809 --> 00:46:02.819 align:start position:0%
standardized uh
 
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.150 align:start position:0%
 
Mike

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
Mike
 
00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:13.700 align:start position:0%
um when a court is looking at to
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
legislative intent uh statutory
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
construction if they see in some places
 
00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
where a step where statutes under a
 
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
specific chapter authorize perjury and
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
in other places it does not the court is
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
going to assume that it was legislative
 
00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
intent where it did not impose perjury
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
that that was what the legislature
 
00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
I think I
 
00:46:47.329 --> 00:46:47.339 align:start position:0%
um I we rely I'm rely on staff's
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
comments and uh I'm not at all qualified
 
00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
to arbitrate this debate in any ways uh
 
00:46:56.569 --> 00:46:56.579 align:start position:0%
I do recall why this authority to change
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
forms was given I was here and it was
 
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
for expedience purposes
 
00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:05.220 align:start position:0%
um IRS changes rules and would mandate a
 
00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:08.420 align:start position:0%
change in your forms and the gel car
 
00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
process did not afford the dra to be
 
00:47:14.329 --> 00:47:14.339 align:start position:0%
timely enough in changing the forms to
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
comply with
 
00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
I I the chair probably remembers this
 
00:47:20.089 --> 00:47:20.099 align:start position:0%
but anyways I
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
I think well I'm not sure what we need I
 
00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
I would uh
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
propose a conditional approval based on
 
00:47:31.609 --> 00:47:31.619 align:start position:0%
um staff comments or maybe an objection
 
00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
um what would resolve this but it does
 
00:47:37.609 --> 00:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
need to be resolved and I would suggest
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
that the agency submit for statutory
 
00:47:42.079 --> 00:47:43.970 align:start position:0%
that the agency submit for statutory
Corrections

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
Corrections
 
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
um to address this issue and I I
 
00:47:47.569 --> 00:47:47.579 align:start position:0%
wouldn't see that there would be a lot
 
00:47:49.849 --> 00:47:49.859 align:start position:0%
of problem in obtaining that just not
 
00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
very timely so I'm not sure what would
 
00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:54.660 align:start position:0%
work best and I would just need some
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
advice on that for maybe staff or where
 
00:47:59.210 --> 00:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
we are in the time factor for this rule
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
if there is time allowed to do that am I
 
00:48:04.849 --> 00:48:04.859 align:start position:0%
clear enough Mr chair and
 
00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:07.380 align:start position:0%
yeah I concur bill
 
00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:10.010 align:start position:0%
yeah I concur bill
um

00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
uh if I may Mr chair what the committee
 
00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:13.740 align:start position:0%
could potentially do is a conditional
 
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
approval with the recommendation that
 
00:48:20.809 --> 00:48:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay so you you agree with you need a
 
00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
legislative no um I I think we are able
 
00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:27.950 align:start position:0%
legislative no um I I think we are able
to

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
um submit a legislative proposal to to
 
00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:35.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
let's revisit this at the continued
 
00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:47.089 --> 00:48:47.099 align:start position:0%
so we make sure that uh Mr chair the two
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
proposals that were pushed to the
 
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
October 20th meeting are actually the
 
00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
department of revenues because they are
 
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
unavailable to be at the continued
 
00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
meeting on October 6th okay
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
so we'll do that do we need
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
to waive anything to do that
 
00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:04.790 align:start position:0%
to waive anything to do that
okay

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
we'll see you again
 
00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
right just to clarify um is there any
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
action on our part
 
00:49:14.569 --> 00:49:14.579 align:start position:0%
between now and the 20th
 
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
I think you should be prepared at the
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
at that meeting to say
 
00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
you we need to change this
 
00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
this statute to include the penalty of
 
00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
perjury for example
 
00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:31.670 align:start position:0%
perjury for example
and

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
um what was the
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
what was the other I remember that that
 
00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:37.740 align:start position:0%
if we need specific Authority for
 
00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
perjury then you need to have it every
 
00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:42.660 align:start position:0%
place that it's applicable what was the
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
other statutory change
 
00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:47.220 align:start position:0%
um on one of the forms there's statutory
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
language that's required in the form to
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
affirm and so that language needs to be
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
changed yes either the form or the
 
00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
statute needs to be changed yeah that
 
00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:58.550 align:start position:0%
statute needs to be changed yeah that
second

00:49:58.550 --> 00:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
um item it mentioned is it's much easier
 
00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
yes definitely yep
 
00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
okay and representative hatch has agreed
 
00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:10.140 align:start position:0%
to be the prime sponsor if if there are
 
00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
legislative changes needed to be
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
sponsored thank you
 
00:50:17.809 --> 00:50:17.819 align:start position:0%
to affect that you would need to contact
 
00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:20.220 align:start position:0%
me I'm always available I will not
 
00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
follow up with you until you come to me
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
with what you need sure so that's clear
 
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:50:28.849 --> 00:50:28.859 align:start position:0%
um shall we also address the uh the
 
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
do you have a response to that yes
 
00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.410 align:start position:0%
do you have a response to that yes
um

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
the issue with the sufficiency uh
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
terminology that's used as in the
 
00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax rule also in the tobacco tax
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
RSA and that specifically relates to the
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
sufficiency of stamps text stamps that's
 
00:51:02.089 --> 00:51:02.099 align:start position:0%
required by the wholesalers so
 
00:51:04.609 --> 00:51:04.619 align:start position:0%
wholesalers they keep tobacco products
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and little cigars in various
 
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
locations in New Hampshire and it is the
 
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:13.740 align:start position:0%
requirement by Statute that the
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
wholesalers would need to keep maintain
 
00:51:20.089 --> 00:51:20.099 align:start position:0%
a sufficient amount of stamps to be uh
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
to be attached to all the tobacco
 
00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.290 align:start position:0%
to be attached to all the tobacco
products

00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
um so that is that terminology of
 
00:51:29.569 --> 00:51:29.579 align:start position:0%
sufficiency so in from the dra
 
00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
standpoint we do not know
 
00:51:35.089 --> 00:51:35.099 align:start position:0%
how many products the um that the
 
00:51:37.549 --> 00:51:37.559 align:start position:0%
wholesaler would have maintained in each
 
00:51:40.930 --> 00:51:40.940 align:start position:0%
of these locations and therefore
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
reading the the language in the rule as
 
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
well as the statute they're both
 
00:51:48.049 --> 00:51:48.059 align:start position:0%
consistent and that requiring that okay
 
00:51:50.569 --> 00:51:50.579 align:start position:0%
it is the wholesalers who know what is
 
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
there we're not requiring them to keep
 
00:51:55.849 --> 00:51:55.859 align:start position:0%
additional stamps we just require them
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
to keep the amount of stamps that is
 
00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
required to be to be attached to all the
 
00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
products that's available on location
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
um so um that that's the the use of the
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
word sufficient
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
and if I may um this particular language
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
is already in the existing rule it was
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
brought up as a staff comment the last
 
00:52:19.849 --> 00:52:19.859 align:start position:0%
time these rules went through the
 
00:52:19.859 --> 00:52:20.690 align:start position:0%
time these rules went through the
process

00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:22.380 align:start position:0%
um and the rule was still adopted with
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
that language in place um however for
 
00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
consistency staff felt it should be
 
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
brought up again for this committee
 
00:52:32.329 --> 00:52:32.339 align:start position:0%
okay well
 
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to belabor this but to that
 
00:52:36.839 --> 00:52:37.849 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to belabor this but to that
end

00:52:37.849 --> 00:52:37.859 align:start position:0%
end
 
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
um could you just say why that word
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
sufficient we don't like relative terms
 
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
and that's a relative term but
 
00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:47.220 align:start position:0%
I have some understanding in the process
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
for tax DMS so your wholesaler has
 
00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
enormous inventory of tobacco products
 
00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
and would it would it be that it would
 
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
be impractical to require them to have
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
sufficient stance
 
00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
available on site for all inventory in
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
place or what is the reason that the
 
00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
insistence of sufficient is used as
 
00:53:11.569 --> 00:53:11.579 align:start position:0%
opposed to explicit say as enough stamps
 
00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:14.220 align:start position:0%
to cover current inventory or something
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
such as that I mean I I understand the
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
process and maybe that won't be a
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
workable thing for wholesalers but could
 
00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
you just speak to that briefly if that
 
00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
would be okay Mr chair sure
 
00:53:26.329 --> 00:53:26.339 align:start position:0%
I think that's
 
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
um to your point uh representative I
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
think that's
 
00:53:32.329 --> 00:53:32.339 align:start position:0%
achieves the same results
 
00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
so um I guess
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
changing the language to to say what you
 
00:53:46.849 --> 00:53:46.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
okay but just my concern is does that is
 
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
that practical that's oh as I would I
 
00:53:54.049 --> 00:53:54.059 align:start position:0%
would like to understand that uh knowing
 
00:53:56.930 --> 00:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
someone about the process that how it
 
00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:58.010 align:start position:0%
someone about the process that how it
works

00:53:58.010 --> 00:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
works
 
00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
um I I would my apologies I wouldn't
 
00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
know whether how practical it is from
 
00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
the wholesale wholesalers position but
 
00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:07.190 align:start position:0%
the wholesale wholesalers position but
the

00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
you know they they wouldn't know how
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
many how much products they have in the
 
00:54:13.069 --> 00:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
warehouse and how much they're planning
 
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
to have in the warehouse or wherever
 
00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
location that they have and they should
 
00:54:19.849 --> 00:54:19.859 align:start position:0%
according to the statute
 
00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
um you know they should bake into their
 
00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
process of ordering the products in to
 
00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
the state or into the location the same
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
time obtaining their
 
00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:32.220 align:start position:0%
the stamps required to attach to all the
 
00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:36.470 align:start position:0%
the stamps required to attach to all the
products

00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:38.450 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
okay well we shouldn't try to fix this
 
00:54:43.609 --> 00:54:43.619 align:start position:0%
on the fly so you they're gonna do did I
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
hear you say Mr chairman that we're
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
going to cut have a continued meeting
 
00:54:50.569 --> 00:54:50.579 align:start position:0%
no they'll be at the next break at the
 
00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:52.740 align:start position:0%
next regular meeting okay so we just
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
need to work this all out so we're not
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
doing it on the fly right now we have to
 
00:54:59.089 --> 00:54:59.099 align:start position:0%
have it specific so that it's workable
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Mr chair if I may just so to
 
00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
that point when you come back maybe if
 
00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
and I'm not any way suggesting to tell
 
00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:12.300 align:start position:0%
you what to do or not to do but I think
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
I would be a little bit comforted if you
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
did have a dialogue with the wholesalers
 
00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.950 align:start position:0%
did have a dialogue with the wholesalers
to

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
um get feedback as to what might be
 
00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
required and is that practical or not I
 
00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:26.030 align:start position:0%
required and is that practical or not I
I

00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
I would hate to mandate that if it was
 
00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:30.660 align:start position:0%
totally impractical and I'm not sure it
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
is or isn't Mr chair I'm sorry they'll
 
00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
be in touch with you about this thank
 
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
you but uh representative um it is a
 
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
requirement in the statute so it's not
 
00:55:43.549 --> 00:55:43.559 align:start position:0%
an additional requirement imposed on the
 
00:55:49.069 --> 00:55:49.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.079 --> 00:55:50.450 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:58.370 align:start position:0%
insurance department
both

00:55:58.370 --> 00:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
no let's just gotta deal with it
 
00:56:26.690 --> 00:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:39.109 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:39.119 --> 00:56:42.109 align:start position:0%
 
proceed

00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
so this particular rule
 
00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:47.630 align:start position:0%
so this particular rule
um

00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
the first comment is on page two
 
00:56:51.599 --> 00:56:52.430 align:start position:0%
the first comment is on page two
um

00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's a note to jail car in that
 
00:56:55.200 --> 00:57:01.030 align:start position:0%
it's a note to jail car in that
insurance

00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:06.200 align:start position:0%
350201 A1 B2 has some included language
 
00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
the language being or any other
 
00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
valuation mortality table adopted by the
 
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
National Association of insurance
 
00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:16.380 align:start position:0%
commissioner after the 2022 effective
 
00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
date of this Rule and promulgated by the
 
00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%
rule of the commissioner for this
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
purpose is not consistent with the rule
 
00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:26.180 align:start position:0%
that is cited in that particular section
 
00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
this comment also continues on to
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
a couple other sections on that page as
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
well as onto page three where that
 
00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
language appears in this rule but does
 
00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:41.220 align:start position:0%
not appear in the rule that is cited uh
 
00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
therefore the rules are inconsistent and
 
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
if these rules were to be adopted the
 
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
other rules would have to go through the
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process to be changed to be
 
00:57:49.559 --> 00:57:50.750 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process to be changed to be
consistent

00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:54.410 align:start position:0%
consistent
the

00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:59.530 --> 00:57:59.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:01.490 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:04.849 --> 00:58:04.859 align:start position:0%
that language is totally unacceptable
 
00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
because if you're going to have to adopt
 
00:58:10.849 --> 00:58:10.859 align:start position:0%
it by rule you can change this rule we
 
00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:13.380 align:start position:0%
we can't
 
00:58:16.609 --> 00:58:16.619 align:start position:0%
just give them the authority to adopt an
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
update without a without any kind of
 
00:58:19.319 --> 00:58:21.290 align:start position:0%
update without a without any kind of
approval

00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:21.300 align:start position:0%
approval
 
00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:22.970 align:start position:0%
approval
um

00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:26.809 --> 00:58:26.819 align:start position:0%
it's it's unconstitutional and it's
 
00:58:28.609 --> 00:58:28.619 align:start position:0%
a concern if they're if they're going to
 
00:58:31.069 --> 00:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
have to adopt it by rule they can change
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
change the language to say use this one
 
00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:37.140 align:start position:0%
we have to be specific in the rules as
 
00:58:41.329 --> 00:58:41.339 align:start position:0%
to what tables or data we're picking up
 
00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:46.250 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
so I would like to make that point very
 
00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:51.950 align:start position:0%
so I would like to make that point very
strongly

00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
tell us who you are I'm Heather
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
Silverstein I'm general counsel of the
 
00:58:57.170 --> 00:58:57.180 align:start position:0%
insurance department and I'm very eager
 
00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
to address this comment this was not in
 
00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:02.900 align:start position:0%
our initial proposal this was suggested
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
by the committee's attorneys to put this
 
00:59:08.569 --> 00:59:08.579 align:start position:0%
in and so we'd just be as happy it's not
 
00:59:11.809 --> 00:59:11.819 align:start position:0%
in the model rule as you may remember we
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
follow the National Association of
 
00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
insurance Commissioners the model
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
language that paraphrase is not in the
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
model we were it was suggested to put it
 
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
in and so we did that and then after we
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
put it in we were told well now you got
 
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
to change all your other rules so I
 
00:59:29.089 --> 00:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
would just be just as we would just as
 
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
happy to take that out
 
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
it's not in the model it's not needed
 
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
and and then the other issue is we do
 
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
want to amend our other related rules
 
00:59:41.089 --> 00:59:41.099 align:start position:0%
before the neic does
 
00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:43.380 align:start position:0%
because the neic it's a nationwide
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
process you get input from industry and
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
consumer groups and whatnot and so the
 
00:59:51.289 --> 00:59:51.299 align:start position:0%
idea of trying to jam through and
 
00:59:52.609 --> 00:59:52.619 align:start position:0%
updating all these other rules before
 
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
the neic does we are not interested in
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
that we just want to deal with this
 
00:59:59.410 --> 00:59:59.420 align:start position:0%
specific Rule and this rule does expire
 
01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
in October and so it is a rule that we
 
01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:05.220 align:start position:0%
need for accreditation which is very
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
important to us so we'd be happy just to
 
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
keep it the way the model is which does
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
not contain that
 
01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:13.789 align:start position:0%
not contain that
yes

01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:13.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
so the reason that that language was
 
01:00:18.849 --> 01:00:18.859 align:start position:0%
suggested by staff is because the other
 
01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
sections in insurance
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
357.05 a they
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
some of them referred to the 2022 new
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
table while these other ones did not so
 
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
that was brought up to the agency
 
01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
as a question and a concern that some of
 
01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
them were using the updated table and
 
01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:43.980 align:start position:0%
the other ones were not and that's when
 
01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:46.700 align:start position:0%
that proposed language was included
 
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
just to give that history to the
 
01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:50.510 align:start position:0%
just to give that history to the
committee

01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:00:50.520 --> 01:01:06.710 align:start position:0%
committee
foreign

01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
so that if I understand you correctly
 
01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
you would be perfectly happy to put a
 
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
period after the 2001 CSO mortality
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
table yes that's correct
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
yeah that's like that
 
01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.349 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

01:01:24.349 --> 01:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
the other comments uh that were on this
 
01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
particular rule have to do with the
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
waivers section there was a comment
 
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
citing of a date of
 
01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:45.890 align:start position:0%
citing of a date of
January

01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
January
 
01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:51.349 align:start position:0%
January
um

01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.349 --> 01:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I apologize page three of the rule
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
page six of the packet there was a date
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
cited to the rule in the rule January
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
1st 2005 so there was initial comment
 
01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
put on there with regard to when that
 
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
date was actually included in the rules
 
01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
if it had been after that date it would
 
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
have been an authority comment but after
 
01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
speaking with the agency we are
 
01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
withdrawing that comment as that date
 
01:02:16.609 --> 01:02:16.619 align:start position:0%
had been in the rules since 2004 so the
 
01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
remainder of the comments are on page
 
01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
three with regard to
 
01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
the waiver section the first comment uh
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
is an un
 
01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
clear comment as the
 
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
waiver section does not include how the
 
01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
how the agency is going to determine how
 
01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
long a waiver will last
 
01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
um RSA 541a 22
 
01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
for states that waivers can only be put
 
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:49.380 align:start position:0%

01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
specifically put into rules and a
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
different additionally they have to be
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
clear about whether or not a waiver is
 
01:02:59.030 --> 01:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
going to be temporary if temporary
 
01:03:01.609 --> 01:03:01.619 align:start position:0%
waivers will be granted there's no
 
01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
language here providing how long a labor
 
01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
would last and therefore if temporary
 
01:03:08.809 --> 01:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
waivers will actually be allowed in this
 
01:03:08.819 --> 01:03:09.770 align:start position:0%
waivers will actually be allowed in this
rule

01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
rule
 
01:03:11.809 --> 01:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
the other comments with regard to the
 
01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
section is another unclear comment
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
um as the rule
 
01:03:16.799 --> 01:03:17.890 align:start position:0%
um as the rule
Insurance

01:03:17.890 --> 01:03:17.900 align:start position:0%
Insurance
 
01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
3500 7.07 A1 specifically
 
01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:25.740 align:start position:0%
States applying the rule provision would
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
cause confusion or would be misleading
 
01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:31.559 align:start position:0%
to Consumers staff had an unclear
 
01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
comment on that is if a rule is unclear
 
01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
or confusing to Consumers then the rule
 
01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:38.569 align:start position:0%
or confusing to Consumers then the rule
itself

01:03:38.569 --> 01:03:38.579 align:start position:0%
itself
 
01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
is unclear and therefore should be
 
01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
addressed by the committee and the final
 
01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:46.140 align:start position:0%
comment is another unclear comment uh in
 
01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:48.370 align:start position:0%
comment is another unclear comment uh in
insurance

01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:48.380 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:53.700 align:start position:0%
35707 C where the agency's rule requests
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
a written waiver needs to be made but it
 
01:03:58.609 --> 01:03:58.619 align:start position:0%
does not state to whom that waiver needs
 
01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
uh and my comments is to the waiver
 
01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
Provisions this this waiver provision we
 
01:04:08.569 --> 01:04:08.579 align:start position:0%
started putting in our rules in all of
 
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
our rules back around 2016.
 
01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:13.140 align:start position:0%
um I remember because I was the attorney
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
that started doing that getting the
 
01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
rules up to speed part of that process
 
01:04:20.329 --> 01:04:20.339 align:start position:0%
we engaged jail card Attorneys at that
 
01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
time when we were developing the
 
01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:23.700 align:start position:0%
language we also looked to other
 
01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
agencies that had similar language like
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
I know Public Utilities Commission has
 
01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
some very same language actually so we
 
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
were trying to be consistent with what
 
01:04:35.329 --> 01:04:35.339 align:start position:0%
other agencies were doing so that's how
 
01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
we developed the language it's in about
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
30 percent of our rules now and it's so
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
we don't want a situation to happen
 
01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:46.980 align:start position:0%
where we have to waive a rule we
 
01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
couldn't waive a rule you don't want the
 
01:04:50.329 --> 01:04:50.339 align:start position:0%
situation to happen where something
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
can't be done and you're stuck because
 
01:04:54.049 --> 01:04:54.059 align:start position:0%
you don't have a waiver in your role
 
01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
which is exactly why we did it for
 
01:04:58.910 --> 01:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
history we've had about 10 requests for
 
01:05:02.809 --> 01:05:02.819 align:start position:0%
waivers since 2018 we we've granted
 
01:05:06.049 --> 01:05:06.059 align:start position:0%
seven and three of them were withdrawn
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
if the waiver is not looking great like
 
01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
if we don't think we're going to Grant
 
01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
the waiver we usually tell the licensee
 
01:05:14.329 --> 01:05:14.339 align:start position:0%
it's not looking really good and then
 
01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
they'll withdraw the waiver so we
 
01:05:17.809 --> 01:05:17.819 align:start position:0%
publish all of our waivers so everybody
 
01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
knows if we Grant a waiver for a rule
 
01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm we've been resistant in
 
01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
the past because we've had this
 
01:05:26.930 --> 01:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
objection before as the setting is a
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
very specific time limit on a waiver
 
01:05:31.609 --> 01:05:31.619 align:start position:0%
it's because of circumstances change all
 
01:05:34.370 --> 01:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
the time and we could have a rule that
 
01:05:35.809 --> 01:05:35.819 align:start position:0%
in fact that's what happened with the
 
01:05:37.849 --> 01:05:37.859 align:start position:0%
very first waiver that we granted we
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
could have a rule that is updated and
 
01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
replaces the need for a waiver so then
 
01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't obviously want the waiver
 
01:05:48.890 --> 01:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
to be in place because the rule is is is
 
01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
going to take over and
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
um be in effect to handle that very
 
01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
situation and that was for a new product
 
01:05:58.730 --> 01:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
because we have new insurance products
 
01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
all the time and sometimes our rules are
 
01:06:02.569 --> 01:06:02.579 align:start position:0%
not caught up to the industry and so
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
that's like a common reason honestly for
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
this particular rule I highly suspect we
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
would not use a waiver this is a this is
 
01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
a rule where we need it for
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
accreditation it's setting liquid
 
01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:15.380 align:start position:0%
reserves for life insurance policies so
 
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
I don't think that we would use a waiver
 
01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:19.980 align:start position:0%
in this particular rule however for
 
01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
consistency and because we never know
 
01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen we have added it
 
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
um at this time there was no conditional
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
approval request submitted by the agency
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
so the committee could either approve
 
01:06:52.370 --> 01:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
this rule as written however it sounds
 
01:06:54.289 --> 01:06:54.299 align:start position:0%
as though a conditional approval may be
 
01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
more appropriate to take out that
 
01:06:59.569 --> 01:06:59.579 align:start position:0%
additional language that was added in
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
with regard to Insurance five
 
01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:10.130 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:13.549 --> 01:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
and or a preliminary objection for the
 
01:07:15.890 --> 01:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
agency to respond with a objection
 
01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.089 --> 01:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask if you would be willing
 
01:07:23.099 --> 01:07:24.609 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask if you would be willing
to

01:07:24.609 --> 01:07:24.619 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
insert in the waiver language
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
that the request in writing goes to
 
01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
whomever gets the commissioner or
 
01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
whomever that
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like it would cause any
 
01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
confusion if
 
01:07:43.549 --> 01:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
and the other part is that I like the
 
01:07:45.049 --> 01:07:45.059 align:start position:0%
idea of saying the waiver will be
 
01:07:48.049 --> 01:07:48.059 align:start position:0%
granted for the duration requested
 
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
or or if they're all permanent whatever
 
01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
the case is but I think it's important
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
it's important to indicate that you know
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
if you ask for a waiver sometimes it's
 
01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
forever and sometimes it's not
 
01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:06.839 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear we would put that in
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
a conditional conditional approval get
 
01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
rid of there's three comments to get rid
 
01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
of that paraphrase three comments to get
 
01:08:14.329 --> 01:08:14.339 align:start position:0%
rid of the paraphrase so that the period
 
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
goes after CSO mortality table
 
01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:19.189 align:start position:0%
goes after CSO mortality table
um

01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
the in writing to the commissioner and
 
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
then add the language for the duration
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
uh requested under the waiver and I
 
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
would we would the department would be
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
agreeable to that
 
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
then I move that we request a con
 
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
Crete is that in a preliminary objection
 
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
so that they can prepare the correction
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay I move a preliminary objection for
 
01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
that purpose
 
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
so my only comment is that this expires
 
01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
October 1st so I want to make sure that
 
01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
we are able to get in what we need to
 
01:08:56.930 --> 01:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
before October 1st however we do the
 
01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:58.870 align:start position:0%
before October 1st however we do the
process

01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
isn't it extended by virtue of your
 
01:09:04.729 --> 01:09:04.739 align:start position:0%
being in rule making uh that that is
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
correct because you've started the
 
01:09:08.090 --> 01:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process the expiration of
 
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
those rules will not occur until the new
 
01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
rules are adopted okay I just want to
 
01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.829 align:start position:0%
rules are adopted okay I just want to
clarify

01:09:12.829 --> 01:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:09:16.669 --> 01:09:16.679 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate your checking
 
01:09:19.729 --> 01:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
okay Motion in a second any further
 
01:09:19.739 --> 01:09:21.590 align:start position:0%
okay Motion in a second any further

thank you Mr chair
 
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
so the first comment uh with regard to
 
01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
these rules is on page one it's actually
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
a note to jail car the Department of
 
01:10:37.689 --> 01:10:37.699 align:start position:0%
Justice has had the rulemaking authority
 
01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:40.580 align:start position:0%
regarding charitable trust since
 
01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
1987 that's an RSA 7 22. this proposal
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
appears to be the first time that the
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
agency has done rules for charitable
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
trust so the committee may have
 
01:10:54.530 --> 01:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
questions on how the department has been
 
01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
enforcing uh its current practices
 
01:11:00.010 --> 01:11:00.020 align:start position:0%
without rules
 
01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:01.550 align:start position:0%
without rules
the

01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.070 align:start position:0%
the
next

01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:04.630 align:start position:0%
next
comments

01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
a number of these comments have been
 
01:11:09.490 --> 01:11:09.500 align:start position:0%
addressed in the conditional approval
 
01:11:11.930 --> 01:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
requests that was submitted by the
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
department specifically with regard to
 
01:11:15.649 --> 01:11:15.659 align:start position:0%
the forms there were a number of forms
 
01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:18.260 align:start position:0%
submitted with this particular rule but
 
01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
pretty much all of them were addressed
 
01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
in the conditional approval
 
01:11:26.770 --> 01:11:26.780 align:start position:0%
request the only ones that are
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
remaining are
 
01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:33.110 align:start position:0%
remaining are
the

01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
ones specifically like the rule we just
 
01:11:39.770 --> 01:11:39.780 align:start position:0%
discussed uh the waiver section of the
 
01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
rules had pretty much the same comments
 
01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
that we just discussed for insurance
 
01:11:47.689 --> 01:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
there was a provision that um
 
01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
a waiver may be given to a rule if it is
 
01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
essentially unclear and there was also
 
01:11:57.530 --> 01:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
the requirement that a waiver be
 
01:11:59.390 --> 01:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
submitted in writing however does not
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
say to whom and finally there is no
 
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh length of duration for the waiver in
 
01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair my name is Diane
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
Quinlan I'm the director of charitable
 
01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
trust at the Attorney General's office I
 
01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
I'd like to begin uh by respectfully
 
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
requesting two amendments to our request
 
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
for conditional approval I have written
 
01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
proposals here this morning and I
 
01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
apologize for the late notice I can
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
distribute them now or describe them
 
01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.630 align:start position:0%
distribute them now or describe them
first

01:12:41.630 --> 01:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
we're not going to take written
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
comments now all right thank you Mr
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
chair the first
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
um uh Amendment would be to eliminate a
 
01:12:54.649 --> 01:12:54.659 align:start position:0%
couple of uh rules
 
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
um that I I don't think
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
um are uh necessary uh and um
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
the other is to address the concern
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
about the waiver we've added language we
 
01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
propose language that says any person or
 
01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
entity seeking a waiver shall submit to
 
01:13:15.649 --> 01:13:15.659 align:start position:0%
the director a written request
 
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
specifying the nature and duration of
 
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
the waiver sought and so we hope that
 
01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
that will address the concerns of the
 
01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:27.830 align:start position:0%
that will address the concerns of the
staff

01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:35.689 --> 01:13:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:38.209 --> 01:13:38.219 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
um is there a deadline on this or we
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
were to continue this until the next
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
meeting to have staff have a chance to
 
01:13:48.169 --> 01:13:48.179 align:start position:0%
review the written changes so we can
 
01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
address it at the next meeting is that
 
01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
um so this language was actually
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
provided to our office yesterday and so
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
I did have an opportunity to briefly
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
review and the changes do address the
 
01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
remaining staff comments um the only
 
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
issue was that a waiver was needed so
 
01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
the agency had to make an oral request
 
01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
for a waiver and then additionally with
 
01:14:16.209 --> 01:14:16.219 align:start position:0%
the deletion of the language
 
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
that was something that was new that I
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure if the committee would have
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
additional questions on of why that
 
01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
language was being deleted from The
 
01:14:27.649 --> 01:14:27.659 align:start position:0%
Proposal so if the committee um
 
01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:29.580 align:start position:0%
would like to address this at the next
 
01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:30.530 align:start position:0%
would like to address this at the next
meeting

01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
um then the agency could submit its
 
01:14:36.169 --> 01:14:36.179 align:start position:0%
proposed changes as an amended
 
01:14:37.610 --> 01:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
conditional approval and we could
 
01:14:40.729 --> 01:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
address it again at the next meeting or
 
01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
um where are you what does
 
01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
I am as I said uh the amended
 
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
conditional approval uh does address all
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
my comments so I am
 
01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
the language proposed satisfies this
 
01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
comments yeah let's not push anything
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
else off to already so I was going to
 
01:15:01.370 --> 01:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
make a motion to accept the waiver and
 
01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
uh have the amended comments added
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:14.520 align:start position:0%

no we have voted to wave
 
01:15:35.630 --> 01:15:35.640 align:start position:0%

01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
the amendment in if I'm not mistaken
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%

at your convenience
okay

01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
okay this proposal makes changes to the
 
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
municipal and County aggregation rules a
 
01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request has been
 
01:16:17.090 --> 01:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
filed and it does eliminate all staff
 
01:16:20.930 --> 01:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
comments so I have no comments this was
 
01:16:23.149 --> 01:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
not placed on your consent agenda
 
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
because there has been testimony that
 
01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
testimony has generally been favorable
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
and it looks like that there is also one
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
informational note to bring to your
 
01:16:36.649 --> 01:16:36.659 align:start position:0%
attention in the proposal and this is on
 
01:16:41.209 --> 01:16:41.219 align:start position:0%
page eight of the PDF
 
01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
it's also page eight of the conditional
 
01:16:45.649 --> 01:16:45.659 align:start position:0%
approval request
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
so there was some legislation that came
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
through last session SB 265 it is
 
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
effective as of July 25th 26 this year
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
it is included in your attachments so
 
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
just pointing out to you that the
 
01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
language that is um the highlighted
 
01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
language there has been submitted to to
 
01:17:09.649 --> 01:17:09.659 align:start position:0%
deal with that legislation like I said
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
um there's probably some folks here
 
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
looking to testify so those were all my
 
01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.669 align:start position:0%
looking to testify so those were all my
comments

01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:17:16.679 --> 01:17:20.030 align:start position:0%
comments

motion by McGuire second by hatch
 
01:17:56.930 --> 01:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
01:17:59.209 --> 01:17:59.219 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
any opposed
 
01:18:08.209 --> 01:18:08.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety yeah yes sir so um
 
01:18:14.689 --> 01:18:14.699 align:start position:0%
we realized this morning that uh there
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
is one document that is missing from
 
01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:18.169 align:start position:0%
is one document that is missing from
your

01:18:18.169 --> 01:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
which is the little and it looks like
 
01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
you should already have a hard copy of
 
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
that document it was the agency's cover
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
letter letter to the preliminary
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
objection response
 
01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:39.300 align:start position:0%
so these are the safety ignition lock
 
01:18:42.410 --> 01:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
program rules at the July 21st meeting
 
01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:43.980 align:start position:0%
the committee voted to enter a
 
01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection to these rules
 
01:18:47.630 --> 01:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
based on its determination that the
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
department doesn't have either federal
 
01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
or state authority to have the interlock
 
01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
devices set at an alcohol alcohol set
 
01:18:59.390 --> 01:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
point of .020
 
01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
RSA 265 a37 establishes the alcohol
 
01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
concentration level that results in a
 
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
violation but the statute doesn't say
 
01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
what that set point should be you know
 
01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:15.560 align:start position:0%
the Baseline if you will
 
01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:17.169 align:start position:0%
the Baseline if you will
RSA

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:17.179 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:21.300 align:start position:0%
25943 a in its definition for ignition
 
01:19:23.209 --> 01:19:23.219 align:start position:0%
interlock device says that the device
 
01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
prevents the vehicle from starting
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
unless the person provides a breath
 
01:19:28.990 --> 01:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
sample with a concentration of alcohol
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
that is below a preset level but again
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
the statute doesn't say what that preset
 
01:19:36.530 --> 01:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
level is
 
01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
um a testimony from the Department
 
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
indicated that .020 is an industry
 
01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
standard there was some testimony from
 
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
the industry that initially
 
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
um wanted that set point changed I think
 
01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:51.719 align:start position:0%
from the last meeting
 
01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
um the department had um testified to
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
the um to the fact that the the industry
 
01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
was okay with that set point level the
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
department also stressed that there are
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
two types of drivers the over 21 and
 
01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
under 21 and so that does impact that as
 
01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:10.430 align:start position:0%
under 21 and so that does impact that as
well

01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
but again
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
um the you have the preliminary
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
objection response in front of you and
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
the agency's cover letter and they've
 
01:20:19.790 --> 01:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
made no changes
 
01:20:22.669 --> 01:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
um as a result of um any of the the back
 
01:20:24.430 --> 01:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
and forth testimony that we've had in
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
previously so with that that's all I had
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:34.490 --> 01:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:37.130 --> 01:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
turn your mic on

uh Bob Keller and also Captain Chris
 
01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:54.659 align:start position:0%
feder from the state police I know that
 
01:20:57.470 --> 01:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
in our multiple meetings about these
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
rules there have been several questions
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
from enforcement to
 
01:21:05.570 --> 01:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
the actual program I think one of the
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
we're just here to answer any questions
 
01:21:10.130 --> 01:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
you may have one of the outstanding
 
01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
questions that representative McGuire
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
had that I couldn't answer was the was
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
it the deviation for the device and
 
01:21:25.610 --> 01:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
or we want to share that rather sorry
 
01:21:36.050 --> 01:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:38.470 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
the last time was that there seems to be
 
01:21:44.810 --> 01:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
an industry standard uh but there was a
 
01:21:49.630 --> 01:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
conflict between uh the the practice of
 
01:21:55.490 --> 01:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
using this device between uh what is the
 
01:21:56.930 --> 01:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
the warning
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
and so forth I don't have to go through
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
the whole discussion we all remember
 
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
that uh and how have you resolved it so
 
01:22:06.250 --> 01:22:06.260 align:start position:0%
that we have something that both
 
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
complies with the industry standard but
 
01:22:12.530 --> 01:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
also does not put the uh
 
01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
public in Jeopardy in advance of what
 
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
where the actual statutory red line is
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:22:24.410 --> 01:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:27.890 --> 01:22:27.900 align:start position:0%
the I think that what the DMV will say
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
is that the industry standard and the
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
testimony or the written testimony
 
01:22:37.250 --> 01:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
provided by the industry was the
 
01:22:39.770 --> 01:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
recommendation to have an alcohol set
 
01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
point of 0.020 and the and to
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
distinguish that from the violation
 
01:22:47.090 --> 01:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
which isn't in statute but even in the
 
01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
violation what the statute says is that
 
01:22:52.729 --> 01:22:52.739 align:start position:0%
point anything greater than 0.025 is a
 
01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
violation it doesn't say that that's the
 
01:22:57.290 --> 01:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
preset level
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:05.090 align:start position:0%
 
Tim

01:23:05.090 --> 01:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
Tim
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
so well I'm trying to understand we have
 
01:23:10.189 --> 01:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
a statutory requirement that basically
 
01:23:12.649 --> 01:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
you're you're against the you violate
 
01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
the law if you have a 0.025 and you
 
01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
attempt to use the interlock device is
 
01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
that correct over 0.025 point over 0.025
 
01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
however the state by installing the
 
01:23:24.649 --> 01:23:24.659 align:start position:0%
Interlock system and setting a set point
 
01:23:26.990 --> 01:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
of the point zero two zero
 
01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
is taking action against an individual
 
01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
that hasn't violated law by not letting
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
them start their car and get to wherever
 
01:23:34.850 --> 01:23:34.860 align:start position:0%
they're going so I'm trying to
 
01:23:36.290 --> 01:23:36.300 align:start position:0%
understand where the authority is to
 
01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:38.820 align:start position:0%
allow them not to take not to act when
 
01:23:41.090 --> 01:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
the statutory authorities of 0.025 or
 
01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:43.030 align:start position:0%
the statutory authorities of 0.025 or
greater

01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
greater
 
01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
so the authority is that in the
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
definition of an ignition interlock
 
01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
device the device is set to have a
 
01:23:53.209 --> 01:23:53.219 align:start position:0%
preset level that's going to stop the
 
01:23:55.010 --> 01:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
car from
 
01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:56.510 align:start position:0%
car from
starting

01:23:56.510 --> 01:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
starting
 
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
representative Lang and committee
 
01:24:07.490 --> 01:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
members if I may uh Mike Mike Todd and
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
the deputy director for the Division of
 
01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
I understand the concern that's being
 
01:24:17.330 --> 01:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
raised and I'd just like to to um
 
01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
provide a comment on on what the public
 
01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:20.810 align:start position:0%
provide a comment on on what the public
policy

01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
um implications are the original the
 
01:24:26.570 --> 01:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
intention of the program is behavior
 
01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
modification the intention of the
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
program is to modify behavior of someone
 
01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
who's shown poor judgment and when they
 
01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
are consuming alcohol and making the
 
01:24:36.649 --> 01:24:36.659 align:start position:0%
decision to drive or not to drive
 
01:24:39.050 --> 01:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
the intention of the program is to to
 
01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
help them develop that better behavior
 
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
and if they do not participate in many
 
01:24:46.370 --> 01:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
if not most cases if the individual is
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
not participating in the program they
 
01:24:50.330 --> 01:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
would not be able to drive at all per
 
01:24:51.890 --> 01:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
the court order
 
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
so the reason the set level is at 0.020
 
01:24:58.130 --> 01:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
is because it gives them an opportunity
 
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
to learn to make better choices to have
 
01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
better judgment without incurring that
 
01:25:06.410 --> 01:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
violation that they wouldn't incur that
 
01:25:08.930 --> 01:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
they were above 0.025 the goal is to
 
01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
help people get back on their feet get
 
01:25:13.370 --> 01:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
back into making that those responsible
 
01:25:16.490 --> 01:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
judgments so they can drive without
 
01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
concern for Public Safety and that
 
01:25:22.130 --> 01:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
that's the public policy of uh intent of
 
01:25:24.169 --> 01:25:24.179 align:start position:0%
this of this program
 
01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
and and that's I don't have anything
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
Senator Gray
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh I just have a comment on the
 
01:25:35.689 --> 01:25:35.699 align:start position:0%
statement that would be a perfect
 
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
statement if we were here you know
 
01:25:40.490 --> 01:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
sitting as a body looking at changing
 
01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:41.510 align:start position:0%
sitting as a body looking at changing
statute

01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
but right now the statute says one thing
 
01:25:47.149 --> 01:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
the rule says another thing
 
01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
and I can't vote for it okay
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I think they are within the
 
01:25:58.850 --> 01:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
statue as it was read and if we have
 
01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
concerns with that it's up to the person
 
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
that has the concern to change the
 
01:26:06.169 --> 01:26:06.179 align:start position:0%
statute because again this is where I
 
01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
have this thing about relative terms or
 
01:26:10.689 --> 01:26:10.699 align:start position:0%
not being explicit the statue is not
 
01:26:13.490 --> 01:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
explicit that's our bad
 
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
um so I think they're within their realm
 
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
of authority and I would uh propose an
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:26.940 align:start position:0%
well so I guess Mr I'm struggling with
 
01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
the idea that
 
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
it'd be like stopping a car out we have
 
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
a 70 mile an hour speed limit but we
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
stop them at 60 because we were worried
 
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
that they might go over 70. and
 
01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
they have no authority to do that right
 
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
because they're within the law so my
 
01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
concern is that we'd be approving
 
01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
something just to that effect is where
 
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
well I don't know anybody going over 70
 
01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:48.780 align:start position:0%
nor do I want anybody try drinking while
 
01:26:50.689 --> 01:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
driving we have statutory Authority
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's set and we're setting a lower
 
01:26:54.890 --> 01:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
standard by rules which I don't think
 
01:26:57.669 --> 01:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:00.290 --> 01:27:00.300 align:start position:0%
I understand the concern and I do not
 
01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
disagree with it but our job here is not
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
our job in gel car is to assure that the
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
legislative intent is followed and the
 
01:27:11.450 --> 01:27:11.460 align:start position:0%
intent is in the written word and
 
01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:14.940 align:start position:0%
there's not a defined limit
 
01:27:17.330 --> 01:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
um so they're within what we legislated
 
01:27:19.850 --> 01:27:19.860 align:start position:0%
so if we want to change that we have to
 
01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
do a legislative change that's why I
 
01:27:26.169 --> 01:27:26.179 align:start position:0%
proposed an approval thank you Mr chair
 
01:27:28.250 --> 01:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I agree with
 
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative Lang that this imposes a
 
01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
for whatever good reason it may be it
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
imposes a restriction on people that is
 
01:27:41.629 --> 01:27:41.639 align:start position:0%
beyond the statutory limit
 
01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
it may be good you know good training
 
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
and all that but it's
 
01:27:52.490 --> 01:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
if you're at .020 or 0.0201 you're you
 
01:27:55.250 --> 01:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
are not committing a crime
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
and you should not be penalized by not
 
01:28:00.850 --> 01:28:00.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:05.209 --> 01:28:05.219 align:start position:0%
under the authority of of the crime if
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
you're talking about could be you know
 
01:28:08.810 --> 01:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
creating good habits and all that yes
 
01:28:12.490 --> 01:28:12.500 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that's that's a pro
 
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
if I may Mr chair it was pointed out and
 
01:28:19.490 --> 01:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
I hate to belabor this oh I'm sorry
 
01:28:22.729 --> 01:28:22.739 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you Mr chairman so
 
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
um representative McGuire they have
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
they've already been conv these
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
individuals have already been convicted
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
of a crime
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's why that's why they're required
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
to participate in the program if they
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
choose not to participate in the program
 
01:28:36.050 --> 01:28:36.060 align:start position:0%
they they don't drive they're not able
 
01:28:38.090 --> 01:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
to drive at all and so because they're
 
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
already suspended this program allows
 
01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
them to actually transport themselves
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
where if the program didn't exist they
 
01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
would not be able to do so so I think
 
01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
it's I I
 
01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
I just want to encourage the committee
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
to to understand that that they're
 
01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
already suspended these individuals
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
already have a suspended driving
 
01:28:58.189 --> 01:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
privilege we're not removing a privilege
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
that they've been they've that's been
 
01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:00.890 align:start position:0%
that they've been they've that's been
restored

01:29:00.890 --> 01:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
restored
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
this program is giving them the
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get back on their feet
 
01:29:08.330 --> 01:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:10.370 --> 01:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
again Mr chair
 
01:29:12.649 --> 01:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
I I don't object to the program my my
 
01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
objection is that the statutory
 
01:29:17.149 --> 01:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
Authority that we set for the program is
 
01:29:20.270 --> 01:29:20.280 align:start position:0%
a 0.025 and we're at a different stats
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
there setting conditions below that stat
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
that statutory requirement so I I'm just
 
01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
struggling with the idea of we're
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
imposing a rule that uh or we're setting
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
a new term and condition of a violation
 
01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
even if you're not being charged
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
criminally or or in court you're going
 
01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
to be you'll be uh
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's just a different rule than what we
 
01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:45.420 align:start position:0%
set in statute which is a .025 and we're
 
01:29:46.850 --> 01:29:46.860 align:start position:0%
penalizing somebody below that level
 
01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
I'll go back to my example of a speeding
 
01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
ticket we're stopping somebody for 60 in
 
01:29:55.850 --> 01:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:59.090 --> 01:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
may I respond thank you Mr chairman so
 
01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
representative Lang I I just again I
 
01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:02.450 align:start position:0%
representative Lang I I just again I
would

01:30:02.450 --> 01:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
I would like to
 
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
discuss that these individuals they have
 
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
broken the law that's they've been
 
01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
convicted of breaking the law in the in
 
01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
the example you gave this is a person
 
01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
who would have who would have a proven
 
01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
track record of speeding
 
01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:21.900 align:start position:0%
breaking breaking the speed limit and
 
01:30:23.330 --> 01:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
it's a danger to themselves and to other
 
01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
people on the road and the program
 
01:30:28.610 --> 01:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
exists to change that behavior and so
 
01:30:30.410 --> 01:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
what what this allows them to do is to
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
change the behavior and learn that new
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
judgment without violating without
 
01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
incurring a new violation
 
01:30:40.729 --> 01:30:40.739 align:start position:0%
that and we believe that that is what is
 
01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
safest for uh for the individuals who
 
01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
are on the road the children the women
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
the mothers the daughters the wives the
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
husbands who are out on the road
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
to help change that behavior
 
01:30:54.290 --> 01:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
and that's that's what the uh the prior
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
legislative intent was that's what the
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
Nitza standard Vanessa's suggestion is
 
01:31:00.649 --> 01:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
and and that's what we're trying to do
 
01:31:00.659 --> 01:31:01.729 align:start position:0%
and and that's what we're trying to do
here

01:31:01.729 --> 01:31:01.739 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:31:09.290 --> 01:31:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
yes I move we approve the rule
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
or the the uh
 
01:31:19.490 --> 01:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
objection response and with the requests
 
01:31:22.010 --> 01:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
that the department seeks statutory
 
01:31:28.629 --> 01:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%

yes sir
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
um before we get into the proposal the
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
agency has late filed a conditional
 
01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
approval request
 
01:33:18.110 --> 01:33:18.120 align:start position:0%

to a vote to accept that late filing
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
then we'll
 
01:33:23.570 --> 01:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
um jump into the
 
01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:26.330 align:start position:0%
um jump into the
proposal

01:33:26.330 --> 01:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
by McGuire's second by hatch all those
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
in favor
 
01:33:41.390 --> 01:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
um uh this proposal it makes changes for
 
01:33:49.250 --> 01:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
the process for involuntary emergency
 
01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
admission like I said the agency has
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
filed a conditional approval request but
 
01:33:55.570 --> 01:33:55.580 align:start position:0%
there's still um quite a lot of
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
substantive substantive issues that
 
01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
remain some of them may need legislation
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
to address
 
01:34:06.110 --> 01:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
the emergency rules have expired they
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
expired just a few days ago the final
 
01:34:10.490 --> 01:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
proposal was filed for the August
 
01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
meeting however due to multiple OLS
 
01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
staff illnesses The Proposal was
 
01:34:19.330 --> 01:34:19.340 align:start position:0%
postponed to this meeting and the rules
 
01:34:23.229 --> 01:34:23.239 align:start position:0%
subsequently have expired for a few days
 
01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
the committee may have some questions
 
01:34:26.689 --> 01:34:26.699 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:34:31.370 --> 01:34:31.380 align:start position:0%
that is a way of background in May of
 
01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
last year the Supreme Court issued an
 
01:34:34.199 --> 01:34:35.229 align:start position:0%
last year the Supreme Court issued an
opinion

01:34:35.229 --> 01:34:35.239 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
for a court case of Jane Doe versus
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of Health
 
01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
and Human Services in Merrimack Court
 
01:34:46.209 --> 01:34:46.219 align:start position:0%
and the court analyzed several statutes
 
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
135 C 31 and the bottom line held that a
 
01:34:54.290 --> 01:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
person is entitled to a probable cause
 
01:34:56.450 --> 01:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
hearing within three days of the
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
completion of a certificate not the
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
person's delivery to the designated
 
01:35:03.709 --> 01:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
receiving facility or the completion of
 
01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
the petition there's some ongoing
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
litigation and potentially there'll be
 
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
some legislative changes this session so
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
the department is probably going to be
 
01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
in rule making several times
 
01:35:19.490 --> 01:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
um I think the main comment that I have
 
01:35:21.169 --> 01:35:21.179 align:start position:0%
without going through all of the
 
01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
comments is that the proposal doesn't
 
01:35:27.110 --> 01:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
accurately use the terms petition and
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
certificate and that is problematic
 
01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
because they don't represent the same
 
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
thing if you look at the judiciary's
 
01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
form on the first page of the
 
01:35:39.229 --> 01:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
instructions to the petitioner it lays
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
out what all the elements are for the
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
form what represents the petition what
 
01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
represents the certificate what
 
01:35:49.729 --> 01:35:49.739 align:start position:0%
represents the witness statements and
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
then the physical and mental evaluation
 
01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
the results of those
 
01:35:58.490 --> 01:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
the um according to the statute the
 
01:36:00.410 --> 01:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
three-day clock for the probable cause
 
01:36:03.050 --> 01:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
hearing attaches upon the completion of
 
01:36:05.330 --> 01:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
the certificate and not petition
 
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
and then the mental and physical health
 
01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
evaluations must occur either
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
simultaneously as the petition or must
 
01:36:15.050 --> 01:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
occur within three days prior to the
 
01:36:17.930 --> 01:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
completion of the certificate so it's
 
01:36:19.729 --> 01:36:19.739 align:start position:0%
kind of very important to make sure that
 
01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
that is laid out correctly in the rule
 
01:36:24.290 --> 01:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
right now the rule is sort of ambiguous
 
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
at times it's referring to the petition
 
01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
and certificate when it means just the
 
01:36:32.330 --> 01:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
form all you know the form in its
 
01:36:34.850 --> 01:36:34.860 align:start position:0%
entirety other times it's referring to
 
01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
it when it really means either the
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
petition or the certificate so that's
 
01:36:41.290 --> 01:36:41.300 align:start position:0%
like my overall
 
01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
concern with the rule
 
01:36:45.530 --> 01:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
as I said
 
01:36:48.290 --> 01:36:48.300 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of going on
 
01:36:50.689 --> 01:36:50.699 align:start position:0%
um Chief legal counsel isn't present
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
today so I'm unsure of how much we can
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
actually get through with all the
 
01:36:54.719 --> 01:36:55.610 align:start position:0%
actually get through with all the
comments

01:36:55.610 --> 01:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
but um that's a high level overview
 
01:37:00.050 --> 01:37:00.060 align:start position:0%
there's also um going to be quite a few
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
people probably here uh to submit some
 
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
testimony testimony has been linked and
 
01:37:07.689 --> 01:37:07.699 align:start position:0%
you should have it from
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
Naomi from the New Hampshire Hospital
 
01:37:13.129 --> 01:37:13.139 align:start position:0%
Association and from the ACLU and with
 
01:37:16.850 --> 01:37:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:19.970 --> 01:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:22.380 align:start position:0%
good morning Allison radmay
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
administrator of the administrative
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
rules unit here for the Department of
 
01:37:27.709 --> 01:37:27.719 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
um I do want to touch on the
 
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
interchanging petition certificate
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
um language we did in our conditional
 
01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:35.950 align:start position:0%
um language we did in our conditional
approval

01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
approval
 
01:37:39.050 --> 01:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
Define petition and certificate we did
 
01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
add that in as the whole form provided
 
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
by the court which is entitled as a
 
01:37:47.689 --> 01:37:47.699 align:start position:0%
whole petition and certificate for
 
01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
involuntary emergency admission there's
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
various breakdowns within the form but
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
as a whole it is the petition
 
01:37:58.750 --> 01:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
certificate that is now defined and
 
01:38:01.850 --> 01:38:01.860 align:start position:0%
outlined accordingly throughout what
 
01:38:04.129 --> 01:38:04.139 align:start position:0%
pages need to be used for what in the
 
01:38:04.139 --> 01:38:12.950 align:start position:0%
pages need to be used for what in the
role

01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:16.010 --> 01:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
um and then just kind of going on
 
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
um ATM 614 was created to identify and
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
address uh the process to ensure those
 
01:38:23.810 --> 01:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
who are determined to need an
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
involuntary emergency admission from a
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
certifying provider uh that they receive
 
01:38:30.530 --> 01:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
probable cause hearing by the courts to
 
01:38:32.570 --> 01:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
determine whether the Ia is appropriate
 
01:38:34.970 --> 01:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
uh within three days of the completion
 
01:38:37.250 --> 01:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
of the petition certificate
 
01:38:39.530 --> 01:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
um this this rule is important for
 
01:38:41.629 --> 01:38:41.639 align:start position:0%
several reasons uh to get it on the
 
01:38:44.209 --> 01:38:44.219 align:start position:0%
books um we do understand that it is not
 
01:38:44.219 --> 01:38:45.709 align:start position:0%
books um we do understand that it is not
perfect

01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
um but we are willing to work and we
 
01:38:49.610 --> 01:38:49.620 align:start position:0%
plan on working with our stakeholders
 
01:38:52.189 --> 01:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
moving it Forward at this point as you
 
01:38:54.110 --> 01:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
know this was an emergency rule that the
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
department had filed in March of 2022 we
 
01:39:00.110 --> 01:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
did intend to have it heard at the
 
01:39:03.169 --> 01:39:03.179 align:start position:0%
August gel car we will receive comments
 
01:39:05.629 --> 01:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
back on this from attorney staff on
 
01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
Friday this past Friday and we tried to
 
01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
turn around some changes as quickly as
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
possible again we know this is an
 
01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:14.930 align:start position:0%
possible again we know this is an
ongoing

01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
01:39:16.490 --> 01:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
working session that needs to happen
 
01:39:19.010 --> 01:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes with our partners and
 
01:39:21.649 --> 01:39:21.659 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and we are willing to do
 
01:39:24.410 --> 01:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
that um but we do hope that we can get
 
01:39:27.950 --> 01:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
something on the books that we have to
 
01:39:31.850 --> 01:39:31.860 align:start position:0%
work on so we go without or so we do not
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
go without any rule
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
01:39:40.330 --> 01:39:40.340 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh
 
01:39:42.770 --> 01:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm attorney Steve vonker
 
01:39:44.810 --> 01:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
Council for New Hampshire hospital
 
01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:47.990 align:start position:0%
Council for New Hampshire hospital
okay

01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:51.239 --> 01:39:52.669 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:55.610 --> 01:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
um I mean there are a few options
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
um the rules have expired so
 
01:40:00.169 --> 01:40:00.179 align:start position:0%
um I think probably from a practical
 
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
standpoint if this isn't approved the
 
01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
agency might be faced with doing an
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
emergency rule again so that they can
 
01:40:12.189 --> 01:40:12.199 align:start position:0%
have something in you know in effective
 
01:40:14.810 --> 01:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
they can do that as long as it's not the
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
same emergency rule as what just was
 
01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
filed and expired you could preliminary
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
object and give them time to work
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
through this proposal but again the
 
01:40:27.770 --> 01:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
rules are expired so they're you know
 
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
they're operating without rules at this
 
01:40:32.450 --> 01:40:32.460 align:start position:0%
point you may have some questions about
 
01:40:36.169 --> 01:40:36.179 align:start position:0%
that you could conditionally approve
 
01:40:37.970 --> 01:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
um I think those are your options right
 
01:40:41.810 --> 01:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
now so what point are you in your
 
01:40:46.370 --> 01:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:49.970 --> 01:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
making this a better role
 
01:40:52.250 --> 01:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
um I think I apologies
 
01:40:54.290 --> 01:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
um it's continuous at this point like I
 
01:40:56.990 --> 01:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
said we received comments continue over
 
01:41:00.350 --> 01:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
a year or a day or you know oh no we're
 
01:41:01.850 --> 01:41:01.860 align:start position:0%
ready to immediately go back into
 
01:41:03.649 --> 01:41:03.659 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and start working with our
 
01:41:05.629 --> 01:41:05.639 align:start position:0%
stakeholders like I said we understand
 
01:41:05.639 --> 01:41:07.330 align:start position:0%
stakeholders like I said we understand
Monday

01:41:07.330 --> 01:41:07.340 align:start position:0%
Monday
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
happy to start working yes okay
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
because I mean it's expired because
 
01:41:18.290 --> 01:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
nothing was happening right so yes we
 
01:41:19.729 --> 01:41:19.739 align:start position:0%
understand this expired and nothing has
 
01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
happened within those four days and
 
01:41:23.090 --> 01:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
depending on the outcome today is how we
 
01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
would have
 
01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:34.129 --> 01:41:34.139 align:start position:0%
I have one card from
 
01:41:37.790 --> 01:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
Ms thundberg who wishes to speak
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
so let's let her
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
hear what she has to say on behalf of
 
01:41:55.209 --> 01:41:55.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:58.250 --> 01:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Kathy Bizarro
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
thundberg Executive Vice President New
 
01:42:01.729 --> 01:42:01.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital Association you do
 
01:42:04.370 --> 01:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
have a copy of our testimony for this
 
01:42:07.129 --> 01:42:07.139 align:start position:0%
Committee in your packet I just want to
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
speak briefly to some of the high points
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go over the nine pages
 
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
that I submitted Our Testimony is really
 
01:42:15.770 --> 01:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
centered around the universal fact that
 
01:42:18.649 --> 01:42:18.659 align:start position:0%
patients who are deemed to be a harm to
 
01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
themselves or others should be afforded
 
01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
the protections of the state's mental
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
health system through the iea process
 
01:42:27.770 --> 01:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
having clear and transparent rules for
 
01:42:30.830 --> 01:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
ieas is utmost importance because
 
01:42:33.470 --> 01:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
um they there really hasn't been any in
 
01:42:34.850 --> 01:42:34.860 align:start position:0%
place so I agree with the Department
 
01:42:36.590 --> 01:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
that it's important to have these rules
 
01:42:38.870 --> 01:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
in place however the rules as written
 
01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
and presented to you are inconsistent
 
01:42:42.890 --> 01:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
and contrary to current state law
 
01:42:45.669 --> 01:42:45.679 align:start position:0%
particularly RSA
 
01:42:48.649 --> 01:42:48.659 align:start position:0%
135c29i which says that upon completion
 
01:42:50.689 --> 01:42:50.699 align:start position:0%
of an iea certificate the patient must
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
be immediately transferred to a
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
designated receiving facility or New
 
01:42:57.530 --> 01:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital in addition as noted
 
01:43:00.590 --> 01:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
by the council for gel car both the New
 
01:43:02.270 --> 01:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court and U.S District
 
01:43:03.890 --> 01:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
Court for the District of New Hampshire
 
01:43:06.169 --> 01:43:06.179 align:start position:0%
both have held that involuntary
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
emergency admissions occur when the iea
 
01:43:11.930 --> 01:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
certificate is completed and upon
 
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
completion the patient must be
 
01:43:15.770 --> 01:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
immediately transferred unfortunately
 
01:43:17.810 --> 01:43:17.820 align:start position:0%
there's many areas in the rule that is
 
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:25.490 --> 01:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
um there's just like one one example one
 
01:43:27.050 --> 01:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
section that it references physical
 
01:43:29.149 --> 01:43:29.159 align:start position:0%
exams to be completed within three days
 
01:43:31.370 --> 01:43:31.380 align:start position:0%
and mental health exams to be completed
 
01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
within three days
 
01:43:36.109 --> 01:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
fortunately the the certificate has to
 
01:43:39.169 --> 01:43:39.179 align:start position:0%
be signed with those two exams completed
 
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
so the rules are kind of contrary saying
 
01:43:43.609 --> 01:43:43.619 align:start position:0%
that the exams can happen you know
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
within three days but yet the
 
01:43:47.090 --> 01:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
certificate has to be completed with
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
that done so that needs to be cleaned up
 
01:43:51.169 --> 01:43:51.179 align:start position:0%
that's just one example okay so your
 
01:43:53.209 --> 01:43:53.219 align:start position:0%
recommendation so that we can accept
 
01:43:56.750 --> 01:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
this rule would be to do what uh
 
01:43:58.850 --> 01:43:58.860 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we do object to the rules
 
01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719 align:start position:0%
as they're drafted
 
01:44:02.930 --> 01:44:02.940 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know I guess it would be up
 
01:44:05.450 --> 01:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
to the jail Care Council to be able to
 
01:44:07.729 --> 01:44:07.739 align:start position:0%
tell you what to do as far as how okay
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
so you object to the rule yeah okay
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:14.159 --> 01:44:20.709 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:44:20.709 --> 01:44:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:23.450 --> 01:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the ACLU of New Hampshire
 
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
I'm a legal director there I'm also here
 
01:44:28.010 --> 01:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the class plaintiffs um in
 
01:44:29.570 --> 01:44:29.580 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit that was filed with respect to
 
01:44:31.850 --> 01:44:31.860 align:start position:0%
the due process rights of individuals
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
who are involuntarily detained certainly
 
01:44:36.890 --> 01:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
the uh the rules here are better than
 
01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:38.699 align:start position:0%
the process that existed for the the
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
past decade but we still do have some
 
01:44:42.590 --> 01:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
concerns with respect to the draft I
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
haven't seen what was filed uh
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
conditionally on on Friday
 
01:44:50.330 --> 01:44:50.340 align:start position:0%
but do you you know want to thank DHHS
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
though some of our feedback during the
 
01:44:55.250 --> 01:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
process over July was accepted but
 
01:44:56.510 --> 01:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
there's still some concerns principally
 
01:44:58.490 --> 01:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
actually for the reason that committee
 
01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
Council raised with respect to the
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
conflation between petition and
 
01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
certificate which seems like technical
 
01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
why would that matter and it actually
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
really matters with respect to timing
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
because timing here is critical for
 
01:45:12.350 --> 01:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
individuals who are being involuntarily
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
detained they're entitled to prompt due
 
01:45:17.689 --> 01:45:17.699 align:start position:0%
process and so those terminology issues
 
01:45:20.930 --> 01:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
potentially in our view if not clarified
 
01:45:23.149 --> 01:45:23.159 align:start position:0%
could the rules could then be construed
 
01:45:25.729 --> 01:45:25.739 align:start position:0%
to possibly extend for three additional
 
01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
days in voluntary detention I won't get
 
01:45:28.850 --> 01:45:28.860 align:start position:0%
into the weeds of why that's the case
 
01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
it's drawn out explained in our
 
01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:32.570 align:start position:0%
it's drawn out explained in our
testimony

01:45:32.570 --> 01:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
um and the last couple things I'll say I
 
01:45:36.770 --> 01:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
won't get into the weeds we do have some
 
01:45:39.050 --> 01:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
additional recommendations we think that
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
would make the rules better more
 
01:45:42.169 --> 01:45:42.179 align:start position:0%
consistent with providing due process
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
rights for the individuals who are here
 
01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
because really at its core what we're
 
01:45:48.530 --> 01:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
dealing with are individuals who may may
 
01:45:50.810 --> 01:45:50.820 align:start position:0%
not be going through crisis who are
 
01:45:53.149 --> 01:45:53.159 align:start position:0%
being detained against their will and in
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
our view it's absolutely critical that
 
01:45:55.970 --> 01:45:55.980 align:start position:0%
they receive all the due process
 
01:45:58.910 --> 01:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
protections that they're entitled to and
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
so we list those out which would include
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
providing some Protections in the event
 
01:46:04.729 --> 01:46:04.739 align:start position:0%
that there's decision of an iea
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
certificate it would also provide some
 
01:46:08.810 --> 01:46:08.820 align:start position:0%
protections with respect to the venue of
 
01:46:11.169 --> 01:46:11.179 align:start position:0%
due process hearings as to where
 
01:46:13.729 --> 01:46:13.739 align:start position:0%
they occur and making sure there's
 
01:46:15.709 --> 01:46:15.719 align:start position:0%
clarity as to who is required to
 
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
actually file the petition so we would
 
01:46:20.810 --> 01:46:20.820 align:start position:0%
just recommend some further work with
 
01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
respect to these these rules we're happy
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
to be part of that process and provided
 
01:46:27.890 --> 01:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
comment back in July thank DHHS for its
 
01:46:30.109 --> 01:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
work and and we'll I'm happy to again to
 
01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:32.639 align:start position:0%
continue with the process thank you
 
01:46:34.970 --> 01:46:34.980 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee Bill
 
01:46:37.970 --> 01:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair was these concerns
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
presented to the department during the
 
01:46:41.510 --> 01:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
public hearing process of the roommate
 
01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
keep yes they were uh with Pro with one
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
clarification uh section three
 
01:46:51.109 --> 01:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
um in our testimony which has to do with
 
01:46:51.119 --> 01:46:52.729 align:start position:0%
um in our testimony which has to do with
the

01:46:52.729 --> 01:46:52.739 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh rescissions I don't think we
 
01:46:56.159 --> 01:46:57.109 align:start position:0%
uh rescissions I don't think we
um

01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:58.850 --> 01:46:58.860 align:start position:0%
it's either section three or section
 
01:47:00.830 --> 01:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
four that we have subsequently added I
 
01:47:02.090 --> 01:47:02.100 align:start position:0%
don't remember which I could let you
 
01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
know if that's okay most of it was
 
01:47:06.050 --> 01:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
presented earlier yes
 
01:47:13.609 --> 01:47:13.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
yes do you have a recommendation for
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
what we should do
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
because do you want to have no rules at
 
01:47:22.370 --> 01:47:22.380 align:start position:0%
all do you want us to adopt these rules
 
01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:23.570 align:start position:0%
all do you want us to adopt these rules
however

01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:47:26.330 --> 01:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
faulty they may be that that's a hard
 
01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:27.590 align:start position:0%
faulty they may be that that's a hard
question

01:47:27.590 --> 01:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
um I I think
 
01:47:31.250 --> 01:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
with respect to the definitional
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
problems petition certificate I
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
that just needs to be fixed in in my
 
01:47:38.639 --> 01:47:39.770 align:start position:0%
that just needs to be fixed in in my
view

01:47:39.770 --> 01:47:39.780 align:start position:0%
view
 
01:47:42.169 --> 01:47:42.179 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that I wholesale object
 
01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
to the rules because again I think on
 
01:47:46.250 --> 01:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
balance this is better than what we
 
01:47:48.410 --> 01:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
didn't have anything before so that is
 
01:47:49.669 --> 01:47:49.679 align:start position:0%
something that I'm I'm kind of
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
struggling with to to be honest I'm
 
01:47:53.590 --> 01:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't have a direct answer
 
01:47:55.729 --> 01:47:55.739 align:start position:0%
that's probably the best I can do at the
 
01:47:55.739 --> 01:47:59.689 align:start position:0%
that's probably the best I can do at the
moment

01:47:59.689 --> 01:47:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
can we expect something by our continued
 
01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:09.830 align:start position:0%
can we expect something by our continued
meeting

01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
um I would have to touch base with uh
 
01:48:14.149 --> 01:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
Chief legal officer things here once she
 
01:48:16.490 --> 01:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
gets back from traveling to travel for
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:22.189 --> 01:48:22.199 align:start position:0%
um but once she gets back into the
 
01:48:22.199 --> 01:48:27.470 align:start position:0%
um but once she gets back into the
office

01:48:27.470 --> 01:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
could I also be cleared I'm sorry Mr
 
01:48:31.129 --> 01:48:31.139 align:start position:0%
chairman I don't want to interrupt I I
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
am strictly basing my testimony on the
 
01:48:36.590 --> 01:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
the version from July 26th I do not know
 
01:48:38.990 --> 01:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
whether in the subsequent filing changes
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
were made consistent with our public
 
01:48:43.370 --> 01:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
comment so I just wanted to make that
 
01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
abundantly clear I have not seen any new
 
01:48:48.770 --> 01:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:50.810 --> 01:48:50.820 align:start position:0%
I can get a conditional approval
 
01:48:53.870 --> 01:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
um request copy out to the stakeholders
 
01:48:55.790 --> 01:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
so it's certainly possible that perhaps
 
01:48:57.709 --> 01:48:57.719 align:start position:0%
some of these issues were rectified I I
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
just I haven't seen it I'm sorry
 
01:49:03.530 --> 01:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
is that conditional approval request on
 
01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
the it is linked yes you do have it yes
 
01:49:09.410 --> 01:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
ma'am it is on on the teleport packets
 
01:49:12.890 --> 01:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
website oh I I apologize I I can't read
 
01:49:15.950 --> 01:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
16 people I'm sorry my testimony is to
 
01:49:18.649 --> 01:49:18.659 align:start position:0%
be abundantly clear based on the July 26
 
01:49:18.659 --> 01:49:20.270 align:start position:0%
be abundantly clear based on the July 26
version

01:49:20.270 --> 01:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
version
 
01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
um I just want to clarify that I'm sorry
 
01:49:27.250 --> 01:49:27.260 align:start position:0%
so for patients now
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:34.490 --> 01:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
grants them protection
 
01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
yes I think that's right I you know I it
 
01:49:40.669 --> 01:49:40.679 align:start position:0%
provides currently the prac unlike what
 
01:49:42.530 --> 01:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
was happening before it seems that due
 
01:49:45.290 --> 01:49:45.300 align:start position:0%
process hearings are actually now being
 
01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
provided in in some instances even when
 
01:49:49.970 --> 01:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
individuals are in emergency rooms which
 
01:49:52.370 --> 01:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
was not happening before due process was
 
01:49:54.290 --> 01:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
provided once they went to the
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
designated receiving facility often New
 
01:49:57.709 --> 01:49:57.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital but because of the
 
01:49:59.510 --> 01:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
wait list that could have been weeks at
 
01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
a time
 
01:50:03.050 --> 01:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
um so so there are hearings happening
 
01:50:04.490 --> 01:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
now actually I'm not going to get into
 
01:50:06.050 --> 01:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
the details of this but I have to be
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
clear for the record that we actually
 
01:50:09.590 --> 01:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
don't think the way these hearings are
 
01:50:11.390 --> 01:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
currently conducted are fully consistent
 
01:50:13.790 --> 01:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
with due process they're telephonic so
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
the courts can't meaningfully in our
 
01:50:17.330 --> 01:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
view engage with the patients this this
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
rule is not really addressing that
 
01:50:21.229 --> 01:50:21.239 align:start position:0%
though right it's just addressing when
 
01:50:24.590 --> 01:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
these hearings occur so to answer your
 
01:50:25.850 --> 01:50:25.860 align:start position:0%
question more directly there are
 
01:50:27.290 --> 01:50:27.300 align:start position:0%
hearings happening now they weren't
 
01:50:28.669 --> 01:50:28.679 align:start position:0%
happening before we have separate
 
01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
concerns that will raise it another
 
01:50:34.609 --> 01:50:34.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:37.310 --> 01:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
with that understanding I would like to
 
01:50:39.649 --> 01:50:39.659 align:start position:0%
move we accept the conditional approval
 
01:50:42.490 --> 01:50:42.500 align:start position:0%
response with the additional
 
01:50:46.010 --> 01:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
consideration that the department enter
 
01:50:48.649 --> 01:50:48.659 align:start position:0%
into rule making immediately to clear up
 
01:50:52.129 --> 01:50:52.139 align:start position:0%
the distinction between the petition and
 
01:50:56.510 --> 01:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:58.970 --> 01:50:58.980 align:start position:0%

01:51:07.729 --> 01:51:07.739 align:start position:0%

01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:14.990 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
the party you're going back to work on
 
01:51:18.169 --> 01:51:18.179 align:start position:0%
Monday we're going back to work on
 
01:51:22.729 --> 01:51:22.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:25.010 --> 01:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
saying no other discussion all this in
 
01:51:25.020 --> 01:51:26.330 align:start position:0%
saying no other discussion all this in
favor

01:51:26.330 --> 01:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
favor

thank you
 
01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
um so this proposal is an interim rule
 
01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:35.510 align:start position:0%
um so this proposal is an interim rule
2022-5

01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
2022-5
 
01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:36.169 align:start position:0%
2022-5
um

01:52:36.169 --> 01:52:36.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:37.729 --> 01:52:37.739 align:start position:0%
submitted by the department and has to
 
01:52:39.729 --> 01:52:39.739 align:start position:0%
do with the immunization
 
01:52:39.739 --> 01:52:41.270 align:start position:0%
do with the immunization
exemption

01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:41.870 align:start position:0%
exemption
um

01:52:41.870 --> 01:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:44.330 --> 01:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
for schools based on religious reason as
 
01:52:47.330 --> 01:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
well as the process for withdrawal from
 
01:52:49.850 --> 01:52:49.860 align:start position:0%
the immunization registry
 
01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
this interim rule comes
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
from two changes to the statute
 
01:52:59.590 --> 01:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
um one was HB
 
01:53:04.330 --> 01:53:04.340 align:start position:0%
1035 which was chaptered as
 
01:53:09.129 --> 01:53:09.139 align:start position:0%
well 55 and the laws of 2022.
 
01:53:12.609 --> 01:53:12.619 align:start position:0%
this particular change in the statute
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
removed the requirement that a exemption
 
01:53:19.250 --> 01:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
for religious reasons to a school be
 
01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:20.649 align:start position:0%
for religious reasons to a school be
notarized

01:53:20.649 --> 01:53:20.659 align:start position:0%
notarized
 
01:53:24.530 --> 01:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
the proposed rule does remove that
 
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:26.100 align:start position:0%
requirement that notarization
 
01:53:28.910 --> 01:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
requirement for religious exemption
 
01:53:30.890 --> 01:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
and then the second
 
01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:32.649 align:start position:0%
and then the second
statute

01:53:32.649 --> 01:53:32.659 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:53:36.430 --> 01:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment comes from HB
 
01:53:40.729 --> 01:53:40.739 align:start position:0%
1487 which is chapter 307 of the laws of
 
01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
2022 that particular
 
01:53:47.709 --> 01:53:47.719 align:start position:0%
um change in the statute
 
01:53:52.129 --> 01:53:52.139 align:start position:0%
requires that a patient or a patient's
 
01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
Guardian if the patient is a minor May
 
01:53:57.229 --> 01:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
withdraw from participation in the
 
01:54:00.890 --> 01:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
immunization registry by either having a
 
01:54:04.010 --> 01:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
health care provider sign off on the
 
01:54:07.570 --> 01:54:07.580 align:start position:0%
form or for the form to be notarized
 
01:54:10.129 --> 01:54:10.139 align:start position:0%
that was also
 
01:54:13.850 --> 01:54:13.860 align:start position:0%
uh changed in the rule and then with
 
01:54:17.090 --> 01:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
regard to staff comments we did have a
 
01:54:19.609 --> 01:54:19.619 align:start position:0%
couple unclear legislative intent
 
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
comments however the agency did submit a
 
01:54:23.570 --> 01:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request which
 
01:54:25.729 --> 01:54:25.739 align:start position:0%
addressed all of the staff comments so
 
01:54:28.810 --> 01:54:28.820 align:start position:0%
the only remaining uh
 
01:54:31.070 --> 01:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
addressed those unclear legislative
 
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
intent comments the remaining staff
 
01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
comments are all notes to jail car for
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
um pointing out the changes the
 
01:54:43.129 --> 01:54:43.139 align:start position:0%
statutory changes as well as pointing
 
01:54:45.530 --> 01:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
out to the committee that pursuant to
 
01:54:48.890 --> 01:54:48.900 align:start position:0%
RSA 141 C
 
01:54:51.229 --> 01:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:54:54.169 --> 01:54:54.179 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner does have the
 
01:54:56.810 --> 01:54:56.820 align:start position:0%
authority to design the content of all
 
01:55:01.010 --> 01:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
forms via the RSA 541a process as the
 
01:55:04.490 --> 01:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
rules do include some language that is
 
01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
included on their forms um specifically
 
01:55:07.260 --> 01:55:09.410 align:start position:0%
included on their forms um specifically
regarding

01:55:09.410 --> 01:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
01:55:14.209 --> 01:55:14.219 align:start position:0%
HP 301.13 which is the exemption form
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
they include the language
 
01:55:22.609 --> 01:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:25.129 --> 01:55:25.139 align:start position:0%
required vaccinations
 
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
um that they may change their decision
 
01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:28.729 align:start position:0%
um that they may change their decision
and

01:55:28.729 --> 01:55:28.739 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:55:31.850 --> 01:55:31.860 align:start position:0%
submit evidence of vaccination to the
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
school at any time as well as advising
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
not in the event of an outbreak of
 
01:55:39.649 --> 01:55:39.659 align:start position:0%
vaccine preventable of a vaccine
 
01:55:42.370 --> 01:55:42.380 align:start position:0%
preventable Disease an exempt student
 
01:55:44.810 --> 01:55:44.820 align:start position:0%
shall be excluded from School attendance
 
01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
in accordance with RSA
 
01:55:50.030 --> 01:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
141c20d which is what the statutory
 
01:55:52.010 --> 01:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
language is
 
01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:53.030 align:start position:0%
language is
um

01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
and additionally with regard to the
 
01:55:58.490 --> 01:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
withdrawal from the registry once again
 
01:56:00.709 --> 01:56:00.719 align:start position:0%
the commissioner does have the ability
 
01:56:04.729 --> 01:56:04.739 align:start position:0%
to design that form and has included the
 
01:56:09.229 --> 01:56:09.239 align:start position:0%
language that is on the form in the rule
 
01:56:09.239 --> 01:56:10.070 align:start position:0%
language that is on the form in the rule
um

01:56:10.070 --> 01:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:12.109 --> 01:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
so at this time once again the
 
01:56:14.930 --> 01:56:14.940 align:start position:0%
committee's three options are to approve
 
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
the rule uh conditionally approve the
 
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
rule if
 
01:56:19.910 --> 01:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
the committee feels additional changes
 
01:56:20.950 --> 01:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
are made
 
01:56:24.109 --> 01:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
or to do a preliminary objection though
 
01:56:25.669 --> 01:56:25.679 align:start position:0%
as I stated at this time staff doesn't
 
01:56:28.250 --> 01:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
have any substantive comments
 
01:56:33.890 --> 01:56:33.900 align:start position:0%
thank you before the department answers
 
01:56:36.410 --> 01:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
the staff's comments I would like you to
 
01:56:40.490 --> 01:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
address the issue of your having posted
 
01:56:42.649 --> 01:56:42.659 align:start position:0%
two versions of this form on your
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
website without any approval which is
 
01:56:46.850 --> 01:56:46.860 align:start position:0%
definitely beyond your scope of
 
01:56:48.830 --> 01:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
authority would you could you explain
 
01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:49.970 align:start position:0%
authority would you could you explain
that

01:56:49.970 --> 01:56:49.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:56:51.050 --> 01:56:51.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:56:55.010 --> 01:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire in order to be oh
 
01:56:57.229 --> 01:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
sorry my name is Abby Rogers I'm the
 
01:56:58.850 --> 01:56:58.860 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison for the division of
 
01:57:01.310 --> 01:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services uh
 
01:57:03.770 --> 01:57:03.780 align:start position:0%
in regard to the form the form was
 
01:57:07.550 --> 01:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
redesigned as a result of HB 1035 being
 
01:57:10.570 --> 01:57:10.580 align:start position:0%
signed into law the effective data that
 
01:57:14.330 --> 01:57:14.340 align:start position:0%
legislation was July 19th the department
 
01:57:16.850 --> 01:57:16.860 align:start position:0%
felt that um you know we had there were
 
01:57:18.649 --> 01:57:18.659 align:start position:0%
many vaccine related bills over the
 
01:57:21.649 --> 01:57:21.659 align:start position:0%
course of the session and really wanted
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
to be very responsive to having a
 
01:57:28.189 --> 01:57:28.199 align:start position:0%
ability for people who wanted to have
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
choose to have a religious exemption for
 
01:57:32.510 --> 01:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
their child have us form available
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
before the start of the school year so
 
01:57:39.649 --> 01:57:39.659 align:start position:0%
we updated the form and posted it not as
 
01:57:41.950 --> 01:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
a required form but as a suggested form
 
01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
and realized that uh you know we may
 
01:57:46.070 --> 01:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
have jumped the gun a little bit by
 
01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
posting it without having the form
 
01:57:51.890 --> 01:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
reviewed by gel car so that that was why
 
01:57:55.250 --> 01:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
the form was posted and then we did take
 
01:57:57.649 --> 01:57:57.659 align:start position:0%
that down and now we're here to go
 
01:57:59.149 --> 01:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
through the process and have that I
 
01:58:00.589 --> 01:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
understand there's a different version
 
01:58:03.229 --> 01:58:03.239 align:start position:0%
of it post it again
 
01:58:06.350 --> 01:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
there is a form posted right now we
 
01:58:08.149 --> 01:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
heard there were concerns about certain
 
01:58:09.530 --> 01:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
parts of this form that we're here to
 
01:58:12.770 --> 01:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
discuss today and suggest and have a
 
01:58:15.169 --> 01:58:15.179 align:start position:0%
very basic form for parents to access
 
01:58:18.169 --> 01:58:18.179 align:start position:0%
which uh they can use if they want if
 
01:58:20.149 --> 01:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
they would like to submit that to the
 
01:58:22.490 --> 01:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
school otherwise they can you know use a
 
01:58:26.570 --> 01:58:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
Madam chair if I make yes absolutely
 
01:58:32.510 --> 01:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um 1035 was my bill so
 
01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:33.290 align:start position:0%
thank you um 1035 was my bill so
um

01:58:33.290 --> 01:58:33.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:35.390 --> 01:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
I want to be clear so we we put up a
 
01:58:37.790 --> 01:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
form against 540 that was a violation of
 
01:58:40.070 --> 01:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
541. we took that form down then we put
 
01:58:41.930 --> 01:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
up another form knowing that we're still
 
01:58:43.729 --> 01:58:43.739 align:start position:0%
invite one was dated in July now we have
 
01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
another one dated in in August and
 
01:58:49.790 --> 01:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
before us we have another form dated in
 
01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:51.530 align:start position:0%
before us we have another form dated in
September

01:58:51.530 --> 01:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
September
 
01:58:55.189 --> 01:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
um and and I guess my my question is
 
01:58:57.169 --> 01:58:57.179 align:start position:0%
how did that happen when I asked when we
 
01:58:59.209 --> 01:58:59.219 align:start position:0%
asked earlier last month I mean I'm
 
01:59:00.770 --> 01:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
concerned because this bill was signed
 
01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
into law in May so we had plenty of time
 
01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
either for some sort of interim rule or
 
01:59:07.370 --> 01:59:07.380 align:start position:0%
anything else and nothing was done
 
01:59:09.109 --> 01:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
um it was signed into law it was passed
 
01:59:11.330 --> 01:59:11.340 align:start position:0%
by the by the legislature weeks before
 
01:59:14.570 --> 01:59:14.580 align:start position:0%
that so you knew it was coming and no
 
01:59:16.250 --> 01:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
rule making no interim rulemaking
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
nothing was done we just outright
 
01:59:21.410 --> 01:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
violated 541a by posting requirements
 
01:59:23.149 --> 01:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm just concerned by that and where
 
01:59:25.490 --> 01:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
else that might be occurring he also
 
01:59:28.129 --> 01:59:28.139 align:start position:0%
didn't even bother to try an expedited
 
01:59:31.609 --> 01:59:31.619 align:start position:0%
revision to forms which is a process for
 
01:59:36.109 --> 01:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
updating a form in in some cases and so
 
01:59:39.050 --> 01:59:39.060 align:start position:0%
you're you're confusing
 
01:59:40.970 --> 01:59:40.980 align:start position:0%
you're confusing people who are looking
 
01:59:43.850 --> 01:59:43.860 align:start position:0%
for it on your website because that is
 
01:59:46.010 --> 01:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
whether you say it's a suggestion or not
 
01:59:48.530 --> 01:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
it's assumed to be required
 
01:59:52.189 --> 01:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
since this vaccinations are required
 
01:59:55.310 --> 01:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
and you have you're you're changing it
 
01:59:59.390 --> 01:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
without any oversight or any Authority
 
02:00:02.810 --> 02:00:02.820 align:start position:0%
and I am extremely disappointed that a
 
02:00:05.870 --> 02:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
major department like HHS doesn't
 
02:00:09.530 --> 02:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
understand that a form has the force and
 
02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
effect of law
 
02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
and people will obey it whether it's
 
02:00:16.729 --> 02:00:16.739 align:start position:0%
correct or not and whether or not it's
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
you've made changes to it without any
 
02:00:21.589 --> 02:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
oversight I'm
 
02:00:25.550 --> 02:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.890 --> 02:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that um I we appreciate
 
02:00:29.209 --> 02:00:29.219 align:start position:0%
that and
 
02:00:31.129 --> 02:00:31.139 align:start position:0%
um again we had many pieces of
 
02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
legislation that were going uh through
 
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
rulemaking in regard to vaccination
 
02:00:40.669 --> 02:00:40.679 align:start position:0%
1487 and also HB 1035 we also have HB
 
02:00:42.649 --> 02:00:42.659 align:start position:0%
1606 which also is also representative
 
02:00:44.810 --> 02:00:44.820 align:start position:0%
blank's bill which has an effective date
 
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
of uh July 1st 2023 those are all three
 
02:00:49.609 --> 02:00:49.619 align:start position:0%
related to withdrawal of the vaccine
 
02:00:52.189 --> 02:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
registry we had looked at those
 
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
holistically and trying to move those
 
02:00:55.790 --> 02:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
forward we wanted to move these two
 
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
forward and interim rule again the form
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
was posted and again we weren't trying
 
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
to undermine anyone's Authority we were
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
in hindsight looking to try to make it
 
02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
easier for those folks to to use that
 
02:01:12.169 --> 02:01:12.179 align:start position:0%
form to exempt their children if they
 
02:01:14.089 --> 02:01:14.099 align:start position:0%
chose to using the religious exemption
 
02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
form so we're here today to talk about
 
02:01:19.970 --> 02:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
um uh the forms that we have put forward
 
02:01:22.430 --> 02:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
we hope that we could discuss those and
 
02:01:24.709 --> 02:01:24.719 align:start position:0%
take a look at those thank you
 
02:01:27.169 --> 02:01:27.179 align:start position:0%
one last comment Madam chair yes sir I
 
02:01:28.310 --> 02:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
heard something I want to be clear So
 
02:01:32.089 --> 02:01:32.099 align:start position:0%
currently it's DHHS position that the
 
02:01:33.770 --> 02:01:33.780 align:start position:0%
current Forum which is dated August 22
 
02:01:35.689 --> 02:01:35.699 align:start position:0%
that's currently on your webs uh yeah I
 
02:01:37.010 --> 02:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
think that's obviously that's not been
 
02:01:38.629 --> 02:01:38.639 align:start position:0%
approved well I understand that I
 
02:01:39.950 --> 02:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
understand but I'm just trying to
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
clarify something they said that to make
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
sure I understood it right use the
 
02:01:44.689 --> 02:01:44.699 align:start position:0%
current form that is up there you're
 
02:01:46.250 --> 02:01:46.260 align:start position:0%
saying there's a suggestion not a
 
02:01:48.169 --> 02:01:48.179 align:start position:0%
requirement that parents can write their
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
own and that's completely legal and
 
02:01:57.530 --> 02:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:00.050 --> 02:02:00.060 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Anne-Marie recuri I'm
 
02:02:03.169 --> 02:02:03.179 align:start position:0%
the immunization section chief so prior
 
02:02:06.770 --> 02:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
to this proposed act to put the form
 
02:02:09.890 --> 02:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
into administrative rule the form has
 
02:02:13.669 --> 02:02:13.679 align:start position:0%
not been part of administrative rule
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
um so the department felt as though it
 
02:02:20.229 --> 02:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
was the the best option to be able to
 
02:02:23.209 --> 02:02:23.219 align:start position:0%
Simply take the old form that was
 
02:02:25.870 --> 02:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
original and remove that notary
 
02:02:29.689 --> 02:02:29.699 align:start position:0%
requirement so we removed that notary
 
02:02:32.330 --> 02:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
signature line and that's the current
 
02:02:36.890 --> 02:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:43.669 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:46.010 --> 02:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if they have more they want
 
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
to say before I have some more questions
 
02:02:49.129 --> 02:02:49.139 align:start position:0%
so yes give them the opportunity to
 
02:02:54.530 --> 02:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:58.370 --> 02:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
hello Allison uh radmay sorry
 
02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
um administrator of the administrative
 
02:03:01.550 --> 02:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
rules unit for the Department of Health
 
02:03:03.890 --> 02:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and
 
02:03:06.350 --> 02:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
um we are here again to move these uh
 
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
these new forms forward I did want to
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
just touch base really quick on the
 
02:03:14.450 --> 02:03:14.460 align:start position:0%
expedited process versus the intramural
 
02:03:17.149 --> 02:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
process we decided to do the interim
 
02:03:19.790 --> 02:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
rule process opposed to the expedited
 
02:03:22.129 --> 02:03:22.139 align:start position:0%
form process because these new forms
 
02:03:24.169 --> 02:03:24.179 align:start position:0%
with removing the notary requirement
 
02:03:27.169 --> 02:03:27.179 align:start position:0%
that was actually listed in our rule
 
02:03:28.669 --> 02:03:28.679 align:start position:0%
um and that's something that we can't
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
change in that process so we moved it
 
02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
forward in this way instead but with
 
02:03:36.109 --> 02:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
that we will open to any questions that
 
02:03:38.649 --> 02:03:38.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely thank you
 
02:03:44.450 --> 02:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
um so I'm looking at as part of our
 
02:03:46.609 --> 02:03:46.619 align:start position:0%
packet we were given um the old version
 
02:03:52.430 --> 02:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
of 141c uh 20-c which is the exemption
 
02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:53.990 align:start position:0%
of 141c uh 20-c which is the exemption
language

02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:03:56.089 --> 02:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
um and under Exempted language too which
 
02:03:58.490 --> 02:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
deals with the religious exemption that
 
02:04:00.290 --> 02:04:00.300 align:start position:0%
statute specifically says apparent
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
illegal Garden objective immunization
 
02:04:03.709 --> 02:04:03.719 align:start position:0%
because if religious beliefs the paranor
 
02:04:05.689 --> 02:04:05.699 align:start position:0%
legal guardian shall sign and we've
 
02:04:08.209 --> 02:04:08.219 align:start position:0%
struck the word a note a notarized uh
 
02:04:09.950 --> 02:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
shall sign a form stating that child has
 
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
not been immunized because of religious
 
02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
beliefs so that's the statute as it
 
02:04:15.709 --> 02:04:15.719 align:start position:0%
exists I believe as it's been modified
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
and we agreement with that that's the
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
statute great so as I look at that and
 
02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
then I look at your new form and I look
 
02:04:26.330 --> 02:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
at your new rule my question comes down
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
within your right in your opening line
 
02:04:31.490 --> 02:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
in section e in accordance with RSA 141
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
C colon 20 C which is the exemption
 
02:04:36.709 --> 02:04:36.719 align:start position:0%
statute admitting official which I
 
02:04:39.050 --> 02:04:39.060 align:start position:0%
assume mean is a school shall exempt a
 
02:04:41.930 --> 02:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
child from a immunity immunization
 
02:04:44.089 --> 02:04:44.099 align:start position:0%
requirement but then you go on and say
 
02:04:46.430 --> 02:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
only if and you start adding new
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
conditions for a religious exemption in
 
02:04:50.689 --> 02:04:50.699 align:start position:0%
saying that they have to acknowledge
 
02:04:52.669 --> 02:04:52.679 align:start position:0%
risk they have to acknowledge disease
 
02:04:54.530 --> 02:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
vaccines prevent disease they have to
 
02:04:56.030 --> 02:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the transmission disease
 
02:04:58.609 --> 02:04:58.619 align:start position:0%
none of which is in the statute and
 
02:05:00.649 --> 02:05:00.659 align:start position:0%
which is is a condition of religious
 
02:05:02.330 --> 02:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
exemption requirement
 
02:05:05.450 --> 02:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
I'll go on further and say that addition
 
02:05:07.370 --> 02:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
on the new form that you're proposing
 
02:05:10.370 --> 02:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
you now require parents again because
 
02:05:12.070 --> 02:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
they're required to submit this form
 
02:05:14.750 --> 02:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
you're requiring parents to disclose
 
02:05:16.850 --> 02:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
medical information to you again not
 
02:05:18.589 --> 02:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
required by Statute anywhere in the
 
02:05:20.510 --> 02:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
immunization in the exemption statute
 
02:05:22.550 --> 02:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
you're asking them that which ones do
 
02:05:23.990 --> 02:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
you have and which ones you are claiming
 
02:05:26.629 --> 02:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
the exemption for again not authorized
 
02:05:28.729 --> 02:05:28.739 align:start position:0%
statute anywhere that I can see that you
 
02:05:31.609 --> 02:05:31.619 align:start position:0%
start collecting another database that
 
02:05:33.709 --> 02:05:33.719 align:start position:0%
has immunizations in it
 
02:05:33.719 --> 02:05:34.270 align:start position:0%
has immunizations in it
um

02:05:34.270 --> 02:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:37.970 --> 02:05:37.980 align:start position:0%
so I I'm concerned about those issues
 
02:05:39.890 --> 02:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
that we're setting new requirements that
 
02:05:41.930 --> 02:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
aren't authorized by law in order in
 
02:05:44.450 --> 02:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
order to Grant a religious exemption
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
um and then additionally as I look
 
02:05:49.310 --> 02:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
through this rule I'm concerned as we
 
02:05:51.109 --> 02:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
get down on page two and we're looking
 
02:05:52.970 --> 02:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
at that second line where it says I
 
02:05:54.890 --> 02:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
understand that is my responsibility to
 
02:05:57.530 --> 02:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
inform my health care providers of any
 
02:05:59.270 --> 02:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
decision to withdraw from the registry
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
so that no future immunizations
 
02:06:02.990 --> 02:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
vaccination information reported the
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
DHHS and yet the legislative intent was
 
02:06:08.330 --> 02:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
clear in 1606 and while I understand
 
02:06:11.149 --> 02:06:11.159 align:start position:0%
that hasn't gone into into statute the
 
02:06:13.370 --> 02:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
legislation is extremely clear when it
 
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
says that no patient or personal data
 
02:06:18.410 --> 02:06:18.420 align:start position:0%
such as name address date of birth
 
02:06:19.729 --> 02:06:19.739 align:start position:0%
immunization or vaccine information
 
02:06:21.410 --> 02:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
shall be entered into the registry
 
02:06:25.070 --> 02:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
without explicit written or electronic
 
02:06:27.350 --> 02:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
consent from the patient does it put an
 
02:06:29.089 --> 02:06:29.099 align:start position:0%
obligation on the patient to go tell the
 
02:06:31.129 --> 02:06:31.139 align:start position:0%
provider I don't want this what it makes
 
02:06:33.589 --> 02:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
the obligation is that the state has a
 
02:06:35.810 --> 02:06:35.820 align:start position:0%
requirement to make sure that it has
 
02:06:38.450 --> 02:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
some sort of consent to take the data
 
02:06:40.970 --> 02:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
so I'm concerned now that we're putting
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
we're shifting
 
02:06:44.629 --> 02:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
uh the the legislative intent was clear
 
02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
in 1606 the obligation is that you have
 
02:06:49.970 --> 02:06:49.980 align:start position:0%
permission to take the data and now
 
02:06:51.709 --> 02:06:51.719 align:start position:0%
we're pushing the obligation back on the
 
02:06:53.629 --> 02:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
patient which is not the legislative
 
02:06:55.550 --> 02:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
intent and what our legislation our
 
02:06:58.189 --> 02:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
legislature believes so I'm really
 
02:07:00.410 --> 02:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
concerned that again we're collecting
 
02:07:02.330 --> 02:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
Medical Data that's not authorized that
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
would be in violation of our
 
02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
constitution where we're collecting data
 
02:07:08.030 --> 02:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
without consent in the patient and they
 
02:07:10.189 --> 02:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
can't they're forced to give consents
 
02:07:12.350 --> 02:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
coercion we force them into given
 
02:07:14.450 --> 02:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
consent otherwise the kid can't go to
 
02:07:15.770 --> 02:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
school unless they fill out this form
 
02:07:19.370 --> 02:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
giving medical data so I'm really
 
02:07:21.290 --> 02:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
concerned by this rule that it violates
 
02:07:24.169 --> 02:07:24.179 align:start position:0%
all kinds of a practice and B so my my
 
02:07:26.510 --> 02:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
question is how do we get past that what
 
02:07:29.810 --> 02:07:29.820 align:start position:0%
is the how what is your authority to set
 
02:07:31.370 --> 02:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
a new standard what is your Authority
 
02:07:33.169 --> 02:07:33.179 align:start position:0%
now to shift the consent back to the
 
02:07:35.330 --> 02:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
patient instead of the state who has the
 
02:07:37.250 --> 02:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
obligation to collect the data to have
 
02:07:41.870 --> 02:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative Lang um I think I could
 
02:07:44.750 --> 02:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
shed a little bit of light on why some
 
02:07:46.070 --> 02:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
of these things were included in the
 
02:07:48.050 --> 02:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
suggested form uh that you have here
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
today for the religious exemption
 
02:07:53.330 --> 02:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
um the uh listing of of the
 
02:07:55.790 --> 02:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
immunizations that the parent or or
 
02:07:57.950 --> 02:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
Guardian is suggesting that they would
 
02:07:59.689 --> 02:07:59.699 align:start position:0%
like to exempt their child from first of
 
02:08:01.729 --> 02:08:01.739 align:start position:0%
all to be clear that in this form would
 
02:08:04.010 --> 02:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
goes to the school nurse this does not
 
02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
come back to the department this is a
 
02:08:07.490 --> 02:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
department form that would be used for
 
02:08:09.109 --> 02:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
the parent it would go to the school
 
02:08:11.450 --> 02:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
nurse so these this list of vaccinations
 
02:08:14.270 --> 02:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
is for the use of the school nurse
 
02:08:17.209 --> 02:08:17.219 align:start position:0%
um if there is some some parents opt to
 
02:08:19.729 --> 02:08:19.739 align:start position:0%
opt out from all vaccines for religious
 
02:08:22.490 --> 02:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
exemption others might just pick one for
 
02:08:25.310 --> 02:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
a specific reason the school nurse is
 
02:08:27.410 --> 02:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
the person who is in charge of making
 
02:08:29.930 --> 02:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
sure that the school Community is
 
02:08:32.089 --> 02:08:32.099 align:start position:0%
healthy if there should be an outfit an
 
02:08:33.490 --> 02:08:33.500 align:start position:0%
outbreak of
 
02:08:35.689 --> 02:08:35.699 align:start position:0%
communicable disease that's preventable
 
02:08:38.030 --> 02:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
by immunization per requirement and a
 
02:08:39.589 --> 02:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
child is is exempt and there's an
 
02:08:41.750 --> 02:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
outbreak it's for that child's safety
 
02:08:43.850 --> 02:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
that the school nurse know which
 
02:08:45.950 --> 02:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
which vaccination that child does not
 
02:08:48.109 --> 02:08:48.119 align:start position:0%
have in case there is an outbreak I
 
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
think it was mentioned before that under
 
02:08:54.530 --> 02:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
RSA 141c20d if there is an outbreak and
 
02:08:56.570 --> 02:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
a child is not vaccinated due to
 
02:08:58.550 --> 02:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
religious reasons or perhaps medical
 
02:09:00.770 --> 02:09:00.780 align:start position:0%
reasons they would be exempt from school
 
02:09:03.229 --> 02:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
for for their safety that's why that was
 
02:09:05.629 --> 02:09:05.639 align:start position:0%
included there many states do opt to
 
02:09:07.850 --> 02:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
have that as a listing to help the
 
02:09:10.370 --> 02:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
school identify if in in the case of an
 
02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
outbreak so that's that's the kind of
 
02:09:14.149 --> 02:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
rationale for for adding that
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
um I would say that the the additional
 
02:09:18.050 --> 02:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
questions on the bottom of the form is I
 
02:09:19.490 --> 02:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
understand the risk of Contracting the
 
02:09:21.050 --> 02:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
disease um you know those those
 
02:09:22.790 --> 02:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
questions are you know those are public
 
02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:24.169 align:start position:0%
questions are you know those are public
health

02:09:24.169 --> 02:09:24.179 align:start position:0%
health
 
02:09:27.410 --> 02:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
um uh Public Health statements that help
 
02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
someone who is opting you know their
 
02:09:32.450 --> 02:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
right to opt out for a religious
 
02:09:34.189 --> 02:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
exemption to just be reminded why
 
02:09:36.550 --> 02:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine and vaccination is important for
 
02:09:40.550 --> 02:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
community in school and why there are
 
02:09:42.589 --> 02:09:42.599 align:start position:0%
some students at school that cannot have
 
02:09:44.810 --> 02:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
vaccine due to
 
02:09:46.510 --> 02:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
um neurological conditions due to
 
02:09:49.609 --> 02:09:49.619 align:start position:0%
immunocompromised diseases and so this
 
02:09:52.129 --> 02:09:52.139 align:start position:0%
is just reminding reminding folks that
 
02:09:53.209 --> 02:09:53.219 align:start position:0%
um you know there are other popular
 
02:09:55.189 --> 02:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
other people in the school that that may
 
02:09:56.570 --> 02:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
benefit from people being vaccinated
 
02:09:58.070 --> 02:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
certainly you're right not not to have
 
02:09:59.629 --> 02:09:59.639 align:start position:0%
your child vaccinated but as a reminder
 
02:10:01.310 --> 02:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
for the broader Community perspective
 
02:10:03.890 --> 02:10:03.900 align:start position:0%
for public health and that's why those
 
02:10:07.070 --> 02:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
things were included on this form and I
 
02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:07.790 align:start position:0%
things were included on this form and I
can

02:10:07.790 --> 02:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
um I you know 1606 I know is is becoming
 
02:10:14.510 --> 02:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
effective July 1st 2023 we have done
 
02:10:16.729 --> 02:10:16.739 align:start position:0%
some initial meetings internally with
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
the department and with stakeholders to
 
02:10:20.570 --> 02:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
go over the language for those potential
 
02:10:23.209 --> 02:10:23.219 align:start position:0%
rules um and we are not too far along
 
02:10:24.770 --> 02:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
with that yet but certainly those
 
02:10:27.290 --> 02:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
concerns you express about collecting
 
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
data and how this is written it
 
02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
certainly is is very very valuable
 
02:10:32.689 --> 02:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
feedback as we continue with that
 
02:10:32.699 --> 02:10:34.070 align:start position:0%
feedback as we continue with that
process

02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:10:37.070 --> 02:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
um and you know I and for example you
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
know if we if I could share a little bit
 
02:10:42.649 --> 02:10:42.659 align:start position:0%
just about your question about 1487
 
02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
um about uh I understand the withdrawal
 
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
from the participation in the registry
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh all of those so I understand section
 
02:10:51.970 --> 02:10:51.980 align:start position:0%
of the form if you will so previous to
 
02:10:55.790 --> 02:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh the statute change in HP 1487
 
02:10:57.890 --> 02:10:57.900 align:start position:0%
previously to that bill passing and
 
02:10:59.810 --> 02:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
becoming effective to withdraw from the
 
02:11:03.290 --> 02:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
registry a patient or a patient's local
 
02:11:05.450 --> 02:11:05.460 align:start position:0%
Guardian if the patient was a minor
 
02:11:07.189 --> 02:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
would need a healthcare provider
 
02:11:10.010 --> 02:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
signature that bill removed that bill
 
02:11:11.810 --> 02:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
has changed the statute so now you can
 
02:11:13.129 --> 02:11:13.139 align:start position:0%
have a health care provider if you
 
02:11:15.530 --> 02:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
choose to sign your form or you can have
 
02:11:18.950 --> 02:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
a notary these questions we feel if
 
02:11:21.229 --> 02:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
you're going the notary route would not
 
02:11:23.209 --> 02:11:23.219 align:start position:0%
be something that usually if you would
 
02:11:24.830 --> 02:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
go to a healthcare provider they would
 
02:11:26.629 --> 02:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
go on over this with you as an
 
02:11:28.189 --> 02:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
educational piece before you withdrew
 
02:11:30.169 --> 02:11:30.179 align:start position:0%
your information these were included in
 
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
the form primarily too if you choose the
 
02:11:34.250 --> 02:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
notary option then you have that little
 
02:11:36.109 --> 02:11:36.119 align:start position:0%
piece of Education
 
02:11:37.850 --> 02:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
um that that you wouldn't get if you had
 
02:11:39.050 --> 02:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to speak with your
 
02:11:41.629 --> 02:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider about withdrawal so
 
02:11:43.070 --> 02:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
I hope I was able to answer some of
 
02:11:45.410 --> 02:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
those questions for you
 
02:11:49.070 --> 02:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
02:11:52.370 --> 02:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
so man if I may ma'am one more question
 
02:11:55.430 --> 02:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
please absolutely I I I just I I'm
 
02:11:57.470 --> 02:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
02:12:00.410 --> 02:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
um again understand the statutory
 
02:12:03.530 --> 02:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
authorization to include new conditions
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
because again my concern I'll be honest
 
02:12:07.370 --> 02:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
with them I'm pretty sure I'm okay with
 
02:12:08.810 --> 02:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
the new form you just put up that stated
 
02:12:10.609 --> 02:12:10.619 align:start position:0%
August 22. I would have no objection to
 
02:12:12.830 --> 02:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
that that form it's a clean simple form
 
02:12:14.450 --> 02:12:14.460 align:start position:0%
that removes the notor requirement that
 
02:12:16.129 --> 02:12:16.139 align:start position:0%
just says I'm requesting a religious
 
02:12:18.709 --> 02:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
exemption I'm done and that's it it's
 
02:12:20.930 --> 02:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
the collection of the new data that I'm
 
02:12:22.729 --> 02:12:22.739 align:start position:0%
trying to understand where the authority
 
02:12:25.550 --> 02:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
comes from again that doesn't doesn't
 
02:12:28.609 --> 02:12:28.619 align:start position:0%
exist in statute right under under that
 
02:12:28.619 --> 02:12:30.649 align:start position:0%
exist in statute right under under that
20c

02:12:30.649 --> 02:12:30.659 align:start position:0%
20c
 
02:12:34.010 --> 02:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
um uh statute doesn't have an obligation
 
02:12:35.510 --> 02:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge any of this it just
 
02:12:37.729 --> 02:12:37.739 align:start position:0%
strictly says that you request one and
 
02:12:40.250 --> 02:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'd have no objection if you
 
02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
were being present bringing forward that
 
02:12:44.570 --> 02:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
stats that's that form you just put on
 
02:12:47.330 --> 02:12:47.340 align:start position:0%
the website yesterday or whatever it was
 
02:12:50.209 --> 02:12:50.219 align:start position:0%
um but this other data I'm still trying
 
02:12:51.770 --> 02:12:51.780 align:start position:0%
to struggle with I understand the public
 
02:12:53.930 --> 02:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
health concern that you may have but
 
02:12:55.850 --> 02:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
we're collecting data and whether it's
 
02:12:57.649 --> 02:12:57.659 align:start position:0%
you or the school that's still the
 
02:13:00.050 --> 02:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
government that's still state agencies
 
02:13:03.649 --> 02:13:03.659 align:start position:0%
requiring data and I don't I don't get
 
02:13:05.810 --> 02:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
where we have that authority to require
 
02:13:09.050 --> 02:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
the citizen provide that data not by
 
02:13:12.109 --> 02:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
Statute so representative Lang the last
 
02:13:12.119 --> 02:13:13.430 align:start position:0%
Statute so representative Lang the last
paragraph

02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
02:13:16.550 --> 02:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
which says that in the outbreak of
 
02:13:18.830 --> 02:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine preventable disease exempt
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
student the shall be excluded from
 
02:13:24.890 --> 02:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
School attendance and if that's
 
02:13:27.169 --> 02:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
specifically in statute so they need to
 
02:13:29.629 --> 02:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
know that you have not received
 
02:13:32.330 --> 02:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
the measles vaccine in case there's a
 
02:13:34.250 --> 02:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
measles outbreak and then they do not
 
02:13:36.530 --> 02:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
allow you to attend school so again that
 
02:13:40.850 --> 02:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
is specifically in RSA 141 c20d
 
02:13:42.709 --> 02:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
understood Madam chair and that's why I
 
02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
like this is the new form they just
 
02:13:45.709 --> 02:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
posted yesterday
 
02:13:47.390 --> 02:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
um and the new form is very clean it's
 
02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's again this is the whole form as
 
02:13:52.669 --> 02:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
compared to this one right simple little
 
02:13:56.209 --> 02:13:56.219 align:start position:0%
statement and paragraph a comment and on
 
02:13:59.510 --> 02:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
the new form it says it has that warning
 
02:14:00.890 --> 02:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
it just says the administration
 
02:14:02.810 --> 02:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
immunization agents conflicts of my
 
02:14:04.370 --> 02:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs with the religious
 
02:14:05.750 --> 02:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
beliefs of the paralegal Garden is
 
02:14:07.790 --> 02:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
student listed above I understand that
 
02:14:09.229 --> 02:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
in the event of an outbreak the vaccine
 
02:14:12.050 --> 02:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
preventable disease in my child's school
 
02:14:13.850 --> 02:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
um or Child Care Facilities State Health
 
02:14:16.370 --> 02:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
director May exclude my child from the
 
02:14:18.770 --> 02:14:18.780 align:start position:0%
school or Healthcare facility at their
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
own for their own protection this
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
exclusion will last into the incubation
 
02:14:23.930 --> 02:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
period from the last identified case of
 
02:14:25.490 --> 02:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
the Pinnacle diseases past so that's
 
02:14:27.890 --> 02:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
informational right you're no you're
 
02:14:30.290 --> 02:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
notifying this one
 
02:14:32.510 --> 02:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned especially as a
 
02:14:34.609 --> 02:14:34.619 align:start position:0%
former prosecutor has potential for some
 
02:14:36.410 --> 02:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
overzealous prosecutor to go after a
 
02:14:38.750 --> 02:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
parent because you're forcing a parent
 
02:14:41.569 --> 02:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge uh that you put your
 
02:14:43.250 --> 02:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
child at risk
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
um and and and I and I could easily see
 
02:14:47.629 --> 02:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
a potential overzealous prosecutor when
 
02:14:49.430 --> 02:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
your child gets the measles deciding to
 
02:14:50.930 --> 02:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
charge you with neglect because you were
 
02:14:52.069 --> 02:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
warned that this could happen and you
 
02:14:54.169 --> 02:14:54.179 align:start position:0%
did it anyway and your child's now sick
 
02:14:57.950 --> 02:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
so I I I again I completely I'm okay
 
02:14:59.629 --> 02:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
with this form
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
um that they just posted which is
 
02:15:02.930 --> 02:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
informational and tells warns the
 
02:15:04.250 --> 02:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
parents that if you choose to do this
 
02:15:06.589 --> 02:15:06.599 align:start position:0%
your child may be excluded from school
 
02:15:09.770 --> 02:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
the other one I'm not I I think is it
 
02:15:12.169 --> 02:15:12.179 align:start position:0%
causes is problematic in forcing our our
 
02:15:15.649 --> 02:15:15.659 align:start position:0%
parents to uh to to provide a
 
02:15:17.209 --> 02:15:17.219 align:start position:0%
information they may not want to provide
 
02:15:20.390 --> 02:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
and you don't have a choice thank you
 
02:15:23.390 --> 02:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
do you have a further comment yes ma'am
 
02:15:24.530 --> 02:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:15:26.629 --> 02:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
um I do want to say
 
02:15:28.370 --> 02:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
um that basic language that is on that
 
02:15:30.770 --> 02:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
new form that was posted yesterday
 
02:15:33.410 --> 02:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
um that was one of the legislative
 
02:15:35.629 --> 02:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
intent comments that were provided by
 
02:15:38.510 --> 02:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
OLS um for us to change that made to
 
02:15:41.209 --> 02:15:41.219 align:start position:0%
shall sell these children shall be
 
02:15:41.219 --> 02:15:42.649 align:start position:0%
shall sell these children shall be
exempts

02:15:42.649 --> 02:15:42.659 align:start position:0%
exempts
 
02:15:44.750 --> 02:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
um or excluded from school
 
02:15:46.609 --> 02:15:46.619 align:start position:0%
um so that actually was changed within
 
02:15:50.209 --> 02:15:50.219 align:start position:0%
the rule text and OLS staff did point
 
02:15:50.219 --> 02:15:51.770 align:start position:0%
the rule text and OLS staff did point
out

02:15:51.770 --> 02:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:15:54.410 --> 02:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
um their third comment uh first on the
 
02:15:57.069 --> 02:15:57.079 align:start position:0%
left that pursuant to RSA
 
02:16:00.169 --> 02:16:00.179 align:start position:0%
141-c Roman 2 the commissioner has
 
02:16:02.689 --> 02:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
authority to design the content of all
 
02:16:06.350 --> 02:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
forms via RSA 541a process with respect
 
02:16:09.169 --> 02:16:09.179 align:start position:0%
to these issues and that's where you
 
02:16:11.569 --> 02:16:11.579 align:start position:0%
have these understandings coming in on
 
02:16:13.310 --> 02:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
these new forms
 
02:16:16.370 --> 02:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
yes okay so if you have the authority to
 
02:16:18.109 --> 02:16:18.119 align:start position:0%
include that we have the authority to
 
02:16:20.990 --> 02:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
object to it correct you can only adopt
 
02:16:23.689 --> 02:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
that if it is approved by the committee
 
02:16:25.550 --> 02:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
correct and I was just pointing out that
 
02:16:30.530 --> 02:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:32.570 --> 02:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry I just want to
 
02:16:35.950 --> 02:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
um edit that it's
 
02:16:38.929 --> 02:16:38.939 align:start position:0%
rsa141c6 Roman numeral two the six was
 
02:16:40.310 --> 02:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
admitted from the comment so I just
 
02:16:41.810 --> 02:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
wanted to make clear that that is the
 
02:16:44.209 --> 02:16:44.219 align:start position:0%
statute that they're referring to and
 
02:16:46.690 --> 02:16:46.700 align:start position:0%
yes it does say that the commissioner
 
02:16:49.730 --> 02:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
has the ability to design the content of
 
02:16:52.490 --> 02:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
all forms required for reporting
 
02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
communical diseases and I also wanted to
 
02:16:57.349 --> 02:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
point out that
 
02:16:57.359 --> 02:16:59.110 align:start position:0%
point out that
RSA

02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
02:17:02.089 --> 02:17:02.099 align:start position:0%

communicable diseases once again tying
 
02:17:26.450 --> 02:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
into that RSA 141c
 
02:17:26.460 --> 02:17:28.969 align:start position:0%
into that RSA 141c
um

02:17:28.969 --> 02:17:28.979 align:start position:0%

D
 
02:17:34.009 --> 02:17:34.019 align:start position:0%
um in exempting chill or refuse um
 
02:17:36.169 --> 02:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
having students not come to school if
 
02:17:37.310 --> 02:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
there is an outbreak of a certain
 
02:17:40.129 --> 02:17:40.139 align:start position:0%
disease that they're not vaccinated for
 
02:17:40.139 --> 02:17:40.849 align:start position:0%
disease that they're not vaccinated for
um

02:17:40.849 --> 02:17:40.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to bring that to the
 
02:17:44.089 --> 02:17:44.099 align:start position:0%
committee's attention as well and also
 
02:17:48.770 --> 02:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
in RSA 141c4 in paragraph seven the
 
02:17:50.750 --> 02:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner has a duty to educate the
 
02:17:52.610 --> 02:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
public relative to the cause prevention
 
02:17:54.589 --> 02:17:54.599 align:start position:0%
and treatment of communicable disease
 
02:17:56.750 --> 02:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
and relative to the precisions of this
 
02:17:58.129 --> 02:17:58.139 align:start position:0%
chapter and its rules regarding
 
02:18:00.169 --> 02:18:00.179 align:start position:0%
reporting investigation examination
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
treatment and care
 
02:18:05.150 --> 02:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
thank you attorney Morrow
 
02:18:08.030 --> 02:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
um three points regarding the May versus
 
02:18:11.870 --> 02:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
shell issue staff did raise the point
 
02:18:14.570 --> 02:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
that the rule said may but statute
 
02:18:17.209 --> 02:18:17.219 align:start position:0%
specifically says it shall be the
 
02:18:19.549 --> 02:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
students shall be uh prevented from
 
02:18:19.559 --> 02:18:21.049 align:start position:0%
students shall be uh prevented from
attending

02:18:21.049 --> 02:18:21.059 align:start position:0%
attending
 
02:18:21.059 --> 02:18:21.889 align:start position:0%
attending
um

02:18:21.889 --> 02:18:21.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:23.570 --> 02:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
regarding representative blank's
 
02:18:26.990 --> 02:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
comments about 1606 I would agree to the
 
02:18:29.450 --> 02:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
extent that yes the Department's
 
02:18:30.830 --> 02:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely going to need to go through
 
02:18:33.770 --> 02:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
rulemaking to make accommodations for
 
02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
the requirements of that bill however
 
02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
this interim rule is only in effect for
 
02:18:42.230 --> 02:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
180 days and 1606 doesn't take effect
 
02:18:45.889 --> 02:18:45.899 align:start position:0%
until next July so the department would
 
02:18:49.190 --> 02:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
have time to adjust for 1606 and could
 
02:18:50.750 --> 02:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
in fact go through the whole rulemaking
 
02:18:53.450 --> 02:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
process and have the rule ready on the
 
02:18:57.169 --> 02:18:57.179 align:start position:0%
same date that 1606 goes into place in
 
02:18:59.690 --> 02:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
fact they they need to go through the
 
02:19:03.049 --> 02:19:03.059 align:start position:0%
whole okay and and lastly regarding the
 
02:19:04.910 --> 02:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
extra information that's now in the form
 
02:19:08.089 --> 02:19:08.099 align:start position:0%
and in the rule regarding I understand I
 
02:19:12.469 --> 02:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
understand uh House Bill 1487 has fairly
 
02:19:14.469 --> 02:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
specific language about requiring
 
02:19:18.129 --> 02:19:18.139 align:start position:0%
acknowledgments by the parents
 
02:19:21.129 --> 02:19:21.139 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you
 
02:19:24.070 --> 02:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
oh I just had a quick comment to make on
 
02:19:26.810 --> 02:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
1606 there's no even though it's not
 
02:19:28.629 --> 02:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
effective until next year there's no
 
02:19:31.009 --> 02:19:31.019 align:start position:0%
retroactive requirement that the
 
02:19:33.650 --> 02:19:33.660 align:start position:0%
department remove the data the personal
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
data that's already in the registry I
 
02:19:39.950 --> 02:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
just wanted right
 
02:19:43.310 --> 02:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
okay that's the I guess I just have a
 
02:19:44.750 --> 02:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
question about
 
02:19:47.690 --> 02:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
does does the agency have the right to
 
02:19:50.929 --> 02:19:50.939 align:start position:0%
add add and access for staff
 
02:19:52.670 --> 02:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
um you know when I was talking about
 
02:19:55.730 --> 02:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
that section e where it says only if and
 
02:19:57.770 --> 02:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
then it has additional requirements for
 
02:20:00.110 --> 02:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment of data and might might
 
02:20:02.750 --> 02:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
and the staff has said that the
 
02:20:06.110 --> 02:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
department not only has the authority
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
they have the duty to inform and get
 
02:20:08.880 --> 02:20:10.550 align:start position:0%
they have the duty to inform and get
acknowledgments

02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
acknowledgments
 
02:20:12.530 --> 02:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
if I understood you correctly that's
 
02:20:14.450 --> 02:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
what you said is that it is the
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:20.510 --> 02:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
and if you don't like it we've got to
 
02:20:22.310 --> 02:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
clean us there's some statutes we should
 
02:20:26.270 --> 02:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:28.130 --> 02:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
um any other comments from the
 
02:20:30.410 --> 02:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
Department we do have some public
 
02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:43.370 --> 02:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:45.889 --> 02:20:45.899 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh Leah Cushman
 
02:20:48.650 --> 02:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
representing where endearing
 
02:20:50.330 --> 02:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
um I serve on the house Health Human
 
02:20:52.070 --> 02:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
Services and elderly Affairs committee
 
02:20:54.710 --> 02:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
and was a part of
 
02:20:57.290 --> 02:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
um the process of amending this bill
 
02:20:58.790 --> 02:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
um and can speak to the legislative
 
02:21:01.130 --> 02:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
intent the intent was to strictly remove
 
02:21:04.429 --> 02:21:04.439 align:start position:0%
the notary requirement and I believe
 
02:21:08.270 --> 02:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
that this form that is being proposed in
 
02:21:10.670 --> 02:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
this interim uh administrative rule
 
02:21:10.680 --> 02:21:12.230 align:start position:0%
this interim uh administrative rule
proposal

02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
um steps well outside the bounds is that
 
02:21:18.889 --> 02:21:18.899 align:start position:0%
which version of the form are we talking
 
02:21:21.650 --> 02:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
about the ones there appear to be the
 
02:21:25.130 --> 02:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
proposed rule the the one with the I
 
02:21:26.690 --> 02:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
understand the risk of Contracting the
 
02:21:29.150 --> 02:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
disease I understand
 
02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
um is if you have if that's excuse me
 
02:21:34.730 --> 02:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
for interrupting but
 
02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
is that the rule that that the form that
 
02:21:39.290 --> 02:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
you are the department is proposing to
 
02:21:43.550 --> 02:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
bring forward yes which one it has the
 
02:21:49.969 --> 02:21:49.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:52.010 --> 02:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
that is the rule you intend to bring
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
forward okay thank you
 
02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
um we were confused by the shortcut yes
 
02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
my mistake
 
02:22:00.650 --> 02:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
I have some issues with this form
 
02:22:04.190 --> 02:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
because I think it's well outside of the
 
02:22:05.450 --> 02:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
bounds of
 
02:22:08.270 --> 02:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
um the legislative intent and while they
 
02:22:09.650 --> 02:22:09.660 align:start position:0%
do have the right to require
 
02:22:11.990 --> 02:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledgments this this makes it so
 
02:22:15.410 --> 02:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
that in order to be granted an exemption
 
02:22:18.469 --> 02:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
they must you know acknowledge these
 
02:22:21.050 --> 02:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
certain things and that is not outlined
 
02:22:22.849 --> 02:22:22.859 align:start position:0%
in the statute the statute is very clear
 
02:22:26.750 --> 02:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's one sentence you know the parent
 
02:22:28.790 --> 02:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
the student uh
 
02:22:31.610 --> 02:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
child Shelby has not been immunized
 
02:22:33.290 --> 02:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
because of religious beliefs period
 
02:22:36.590 --> 02:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
that's it that's all the form should say
 
02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:37.250 align:start position:0%
that's it that's all the form should say
um

02:22:37.250 --> 02:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:40.610 --> 02:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
you know the old form that they had did
 
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
not require all of these things and the
 
02:22:44.150 --> 02:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
only thing that changed in the statute
 
02:22:47.270 --> 02:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
was striking the word notarized so I I
 
02:22:49.849 --> 02:22:49.859 align:start position:0%
don't understand the logic logical leap
 
02:22:52.010 --> 02:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
there where well we got rid of the
 
02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
notarization requirement and now we can
 
02:22:56.809 --> 02:22:56.819 align:start position:0%
require all of these acknowledgments
 
02:22:59.450 --> 02:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't add up so
 
02:23:02.030 --> 02:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
um I think that on if the form is just a
 
02:23:04.010 --> 02:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
suggested form and that parents can make
 
02:23:05.570 --> 02:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
their own that that should be stated
 
02:23:05.580 --> 02:23:07.130 align:start position:0%
their own that that should be stated
somewhere

02:23:07.130 --> 02:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
02:23:09.290 --> 02:23:09.300 align:start position:0%
um I I think that this form that's
 
02:23:12.050 --> 02:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
proposed should be rejected based on
 
02:23:15.050 --> 02:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
those extra requirements
 
02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
um it should not feature the word
 
02:23:19.790 --> 02:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
requests or certificate either because
 
02:23:22.010 --> 02:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
it's not really a request you are
 
02:23:25.490 --> 02:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
exerting your right to an exemption and
 
02:23:27.530 --> 02:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
it should just state that you know my
 
02:23:29.630 --> 02:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
child is exempt based on our sincere
 
02:23:30.950 --> 02:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs
 
02:23:32.450 --> 02:23:32.460 align:start position:0%
um it shouldn't require a listing of
 
02:23:34.550 --> 02:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
vaccinations I see that as an
 
02:23:36.710 --> 02:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
intimidation tactic parents will feel
 
02:23:38.750 --> 02:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
fear your religious Inquisition or
 
02:23:41.210 --> 02:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
scrutiny based on having to procure that
 
02:23:44.090 --> 02:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
information and that that there can be
 
02:23:46.490 --> 02:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
religious reasons to reject want to
 
02:23:48.770 --> 02:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
object to one vaccination and not others
 
02:23:51.410 --> 02:23:51.420 align:start position:0%
some are made through research on
 
02:23:53.690 --> 02:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
aborted fetal cells some are not some
 
02:23:56.210 --> 02:23:56.220 align:start position:0%
contain are grown in Monkey kidney cells
 
02:23:58.250 --> 02:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
some are not so there are different
 
02:24:01.610 --> 02:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
reasons that parents May object for
 
02:24:03.410 --> 02:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs to different
 
02:24:05.929 --> 02:24:05.939 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and under the statute it's
 
02:24:07.490 --> 02:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
not required for them to disclose that
 
02:24:10.429 --> 02:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
School nurses when they receive medical
 
02:24:11.990 --> 02:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
records they can request the
 
02:24:13.910 --> 02:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
immunization records and if they're not
 
02:24:16.730 --> 02:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
a complete immunization record you know
 
02:24:18.410 --> 02:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
there's some missing they can they can
 
02:24:21.230 --> 02:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
note that when they receive them along
 
02:24:23.570 --> 02:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
with the exemption
 
02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't it shouldn't be on this
 
02:24:29.450 --> 02:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
form as as a requirement to
 
02:24:32.650 --> 02:24:32.660 align:start position:0%
um to exert that right to an exemption
 
02:24:34.849 --> 02:24:34.859 align:start position:0%
there's also no need for an address
 
02:24:36.830 --> 02:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
phone number grade all that the schools
 
02:24:39.650 --> 02:24:39.660 align:start position:0%
already have that school nurse has that
 
02:24:40.910 --> 02:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
information all that should really be
 
02:24:42.410 --> 02:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
required as a name and maybe date of
 
02:24:45.290 --> 02:24:45.300 align:start position:0%
birth and lastly the acknowledgment of
 
02:24:49.070 --> 02:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
risk to yourself and other students that
 
02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
that's an intimidation tactic as well
 
02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
those statements are not only
 
02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:54.130 align:start position:0%
those statements are not only
self-incriminating

02:24:54.130 --> 02:24:54.140 align:start position:0%
self-incriminating
 
02:24:56.809 --> 02:24:56.819 align:start position:0%
but they also also the risk of
 
02:24:58.070 --> 02:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
Contracting or transmitting a
 
02:25:01.010 --> 02:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
communicable disease is usually not at
 
02:25:04.309 --> 02:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
the is not relevant to the religious
 
02:25:07.429 --> 02:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
reasons and someone's sincere religious
 
02:25:10.270 --> 02:25:10.280 align:start position:0%
beliefs for objecting to a vaccination
 
02:25:13.490 --> 02:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
so again that's totally inappropriate
 
02:25:15.410 --> 02:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
and there's no statutory authority to
 
02:25:16.790 --> 02:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
add those statements to the religious
 
02:25:19.730 --> 02:25:19.740 align:start position:0%
exemption form especially as a as a
 
02:25:22.130 --> 02:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
requirement so either they need to be
 
02:25:23.630 --> 02:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
removed or it needs to be very clear on
 
02:25:25.309 --> 02:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
the form that it's just a suggested form
 
02:25:27.770 --> 02:25:27.780 align:start position:0%
and that parents can submit their own
 
02:25:30.230 --> 02:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
form that's just the very simplified
 
02:25:33.230 --> 02:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
language without all of the um coerced
 
02:25:36.710 --> 02:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
statement acknowledgments and I as far
 
02:25:38.450 --> 02:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
as the form that was uploaded yesterday
 
02:25:41.450 --> 02:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
to the website I have no problem with
 
02:25:43.730 --> 02:25:43.740 align:start position:0%
that and nor with the exclusion language
 
02:25:45.710 --> 02:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
I think it's
 
02:25:47.389 --> 02:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
um that's pretty much in line with the
 
02:25:50.450 --> 02:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
statute and and they have the you know I
 
02:25:52.070 --> 02:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
think that form
 
02:25:54.230 --> 02:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
um as long as the rule says shall be
 
02:25:57.469 --> 02:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
exempt in the actual rule then that's
 
02:26:03.349 --> 02:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:06.290 --> 02:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
director Morrow uh Madam chair I would
 
02:26:08.570 --> 02:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
agree with the representative if the
 
02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
only Bill in play here was 1065. that's
 
02:26:15.530 --> 02:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
specifically deals with removing the
 
02:26:19.130 --> 02:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
notarization requirement it's 1487 that
 
02:26:21.530 --> 02:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
has the other requirements it requiring
 
02:26:25.550 --> 02:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:27.050 --> 02:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:26:29.570 --> 02:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
Madam chair but again that's two
 
02:26:31.130 --> 02:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
different rules we're talking about here
 
02:26:35.889 --> 02:26:35.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:39.230 --> 02:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
h-e-p-30113 which is dealing with the
 
02:26:41.330 --> 02:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
image which is dealing with the
 
02:26:44.450 --> 02:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
exemption language but then you go on as
 
02:26:46.690 --> 02:26:46.700 align:start position:0%
an entirely different role under
 
02:26:49.910 --> 02:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
307.07 which is dealing with the
 
02:26:51.889 --> 02:26:51.899 align:start position:0%
um the removal from the registry so
 
02:26:53.630 --> 02:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
those two aren't interplayed at all
 
02:26:56.750 --> 02:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
they're two separate rules so the
 
02:26:59.090 --> 02:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment piece the statutory
 
02:27:01.309 --> 02:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
requirement of 1487 for acknowledgment
 
02:27:07.130 --> 02:27:07.140 align:start position:0%
is in 307 in uh I mean uh 307.07 that is
 
02:27:10.070 --> 02:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
the registry conversation however the
 
02:27:13.429 --> 02:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
1035 conversation which is uh 301 13
 
02:27:15.469 --> 02:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any requirement for
 
02:27:18.050 --> 02:27:18.060 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment in the statute at all so
 
02:27:19.190 --> 02:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure we're talking about
 
02:27:20.690 --> 02:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
two different statutes two different
 
02:27:23.090 --> 02:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
sections of law one does have an
 
02:27:24.410 --> 02:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment requirement when you're
 
02:27:25.910 --> 02:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
asking to remove yourself from the
 
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
registry the other one doesn't not have
 
02:27:32.690 --> 02:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:35.389 --> 02:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
okay we can we go around like this for a
 
02:27:35.399 --> 02:27:35.990 align:start position:0%
okay we can we go around like this for a
while

02:27:35.990 --> 02:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
while
 
02:27:38.630 --> 02:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
does anyone have emotion I move to
 
02:27:40.010 --> 02:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
object to the rule
 
02:27:42.590 --> 02:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
on the basis of and the basis of it
 
02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:48.849 --> 02:27:48.859 align:start position:0%
motion by lying second by
 
02:27:51.230 --> 02:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
Burstein and representative you have a
 
02:27:51.240 --> 02:27:54.170 align:start position:0%
Burstein and representative you have a
comment

02:27:54.170 --> 02:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:54.180 --> 02:27:55.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:27:58.429 --> 02:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
any discussion comments represent
 
02:28:01.790 --> 02:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
Senator Prentice thank you chair McGuire
 
02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
so just
 
02:28:06.230 --> 02:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
I want to clarify I'm I'm hearing from
 
02:28:07.790 --> 02:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
staff even though I have heard
 
02:28:10.250 --> 02:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
Representatives Lang Lang's
 
02:28:12.710 --> 02:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
comments about two different two
 
02:28:15.530 --> 02:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
different statutes
 
02:28:18.170 --> 02:28:18.180 align:start position:0%
is or is do they have the authority or
 
02:28:18.180 --> 02:28:19.010 align:start position:0%
is or is do they have the authority or
not

02:28:19.010 --> 02:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:28:19.020 --> 02:28:20.389 align:start position:0%
not
Mike

02:28:20.389 --> 02:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
Mike
 
02:28:20.399 --> 02:28:22.550 align:start position:0%
Mike
um

02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:24.349 --> 02:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
because this part of it been pondered
 
02:28:26.030 --> 02:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
that way or was this all Consolidated
 
02:28:28.990 --> 02:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
into one form for a reason
 
02:28:31.490 --> 02:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
I I think the department have to answer
 
02:28:33.469 --> 02:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
that and
 
02:28:36.290 --> 02:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
I guess representative Lang's last
 
02:28:38.389 --> 02:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
comments do raise a question in my mind
 
02:28:41.450 --> 02:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
and I think the department might be able
 
02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:45.359 --> 02:28:56.510 align:start position:0%
 
Department

02:28:56.510 --> 02:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:58.670 --> 02:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
I apologize and what
 
02:28:58.680 --> 02:28:59.690 align:start position:0%
I apologize and what
um

02:28:59.690 --> 02:28:59.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
did you need the department to clarify
 
02:29:08.830 --> 02:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
statement was the acknowledgment is a
 
02:29:14.690 --> 02:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
requirement under RSA 1487 for the
 
02:29:16.490 --> 02:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
removal that parents are acknowledging
 
02:29:18.349 --> 02:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
get information or acknowledge certain
 
02:29:20.690 --> 02:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
uh informational facts
 
02:29:23.750 --> 02:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
um however under 1035 there was no
 
02:29:26.389 --> 02:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
additional requirements made under that
 
02:29:28.969 --> 02:29:28.979 align:start position:0%
bill to require informational facts or
 
02:29:30.950 --> 02:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment of anything strictly that
 
02:29:32.870 --> 02:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
a parent has the right to request a
 
02:29:35.270 --> 02:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
religious exemption and we're adding new
 
02:29:37.250 --> 02:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
requirements that aren't weren't in the
 
02:29:41.270 --> 02:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
bill at Arnon statute and the you know
 
02:29:44.750 --> 02:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1487 is about withdrawals
 
02:29:46.190 --> 02:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
from the registry
 
02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
and one can
 
02:29:52.490 --> 02:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
it's you have to make these
 
02:29:55.250 --> 02:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
um comments but withdrawal from the
 
02:29:57.590 --> 02:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
registry is not the same as exempting
 
02:30:00.710 --> 02:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
yourself from receiving the vaccinations
 
02:30:02.809 --> 02:30:02.819 align:start position:0%
correct we did do that in one rule
 
02:30:04.309 --> 02:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
package so it could be one interim Rule
 
02:30:06.050 --> 02:30:06.060 align:start position:0%
and go forward at the same time we do
 
02:30:07.910 --> 02:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
understand that that is two separate
 
02:30:09.370 --> 02:30:09.380 align:start position:0%
rules two separate
 
02:30:11.690 --> 02:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
issues yes
 
02:30:14.030 --> 02:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
we did that for ease of having it in one
 
02:30:17.870 --> 02:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
package together okay so
 
02:30:19.309 --> 02:30:19.319 align:start position:0%
um and with respect to the
 
02:30:19.319 --> 02:30:20.690 align:start position:0%
um and with respect to the
understandings

02:30:20.690 --> 02:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
understandings
 
02:30:22.750 --> 02:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
um on the religious exemption
 
02:30:24.590 --> 02:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
certificate form that we're putting
 
02:30:31.070 --> 02:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:33.710 --> 02:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yeah because I'm trying now
 
02:30:37.490 --> 02:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
so I guess my question becomes
 
02:30:41.570 --> 02:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
is that if we were looking at this
 
02:30:46.429 --> 02:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
this new rule 1301 13 interim Rule and
 
02:30:49.490 --> 02:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
you stop that where you have the the S
 
02:30:51.469 --> 02:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
the number and change it to the August
 
02:30:54.770 --> 02:30:54.780 align:start position:0%
of 22. period and stopped there and
 
02:30:56.389 --> 02:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
removed everything else down to section
 
02:30:59.210 --> 02:30:59.220 align:start position:0%
two is that what you're recommending so
 
02:31:01.070 --> 02:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
with respect to yes I apologize I was
 
02:31:02.990 --> 02:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
just strictly looking at the form
 
02:31:05.270 --> 02:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
um so with respect to that in removing
 
02:31:07.070 --> 02:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
those understandings uh from that first
 
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
form that's in AGP 301 13e we would then
 
02:31:13.969 --> 02:31:13.979 align:start position:0%
um end
 
02:31:16.910 --> 02:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
I apologize I'm just trying to you would
 
02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
delete the three we would delete the
 
02:31:18.720 --> 02:31:20.030 align:start position:0%
delete the three we would delete the
understandings

02:31:20.030 --> 02:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
understandings
 
02:31:21.349 --> 02:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
um and I believe you guys may have
 
02:31:23.090 --> 02:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment that they are yeah all of
 
02:31:25.790 --> 02:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
those three yeah and would we go back to
 
02:31:27.349 --> 02:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
using the form that you have currently
 
02:31:29.690 --> 02:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
posted the August 22nd form which is
 
02:31:31.490 --> 02:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
this one
 
02:31:34.130 --> 02:31:34.140 align:start position:0%
that doesn't require the medical data
 
02:31:38.990 --> 02:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
which again is not is outside of statute
 
02:31:41.469 --> 02:31:41.479 align:start position:0%
I apologize
 
02:31:45.050 --> 02:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
we're fine yes so we are fine with
 
02:31:47.530 --> 02:31:47.540 align:start position:0%
removing um so it would be e one and two
 
02:31:50.929 --> 02:31:50.939 align:start position:0%
and all the middle acknowledgments and
 
02:31:53.030 --> 02:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
using the August 22nd form no we would
 
02:31:58.790 --> 02:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:58.800 --> 02:31:59.990 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:31:59.990 --> 02:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:32:03.050 --> 02:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
well Senator gray and then Senate
 
02:32:04.790 --> 02:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
Apprentice oh
 
02:32:06.830 --> 02:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
so as I understand
 
02:32:09.650 --> 02:32:09.660 align:start position:0%
choose to go this way then the
 
02:32:09.660 --> 02:32:10.670 align:start position:0%
choose to go this way then the
appropriate

02:32:10.670 --> 02:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:32:13.309 --> 02:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
motion would be conditionally proved is
 
02:32:14.450 --> 02:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
02:32:18.770 --> 02:32:18.780 align:start position:0%
they already have official request
 
02:32:21.429 --> 02:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
if it's clear I'm sorry
 
02:32:24.050 --> 02:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry they already have a
 
02:32:26.450 --> 02:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request and this
 
02:32:28.809 --> 02:32:28.819 align:start position:0%
could be added to that as long as it's
 
02:32:31.070 --> 02:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
explicitly clear what the language is
 
02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
02:32:34.849 --> 02:32:34.859 align:start position:0%
okay so that you
 
02:32:37.550 --> 02:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
is that okay I'm just trying to
 
02:32:38.870 --> 02:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
determine if I have to withdraw if I
 
02:32:40.670 --> 02:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
withdraw my objection based on what
 
02:32:42.530 --> 02:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
they've said and I'm trying to make sure
 
02:32:47.210 --> 02:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
it's clear to to the okay the motion as
 
02:32:50.990 --> 02:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
we stay as I understand it would be to
 
02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
conditionally accept the conditional
 
02:32:55.490 --> 02:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
approval response with the following
 
02:32:58.190 --> 02:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
addition additional comments namely to
 
02:33:00.950 --> 02:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
delete those three paragraphs on risks
 
02:33:04.010 --> 02:33:04.020 align:start position:0%
from the form yep and in the rule text
 
02:33:07.030 --> 02:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
and in the rule yes
 
02:33:10.550 --> 02:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
and eliminate the list of vaccines is
 
02:33:12.530 --> 02:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
that part part of your agreement or
 
02:33:15.230 --> 02:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
yours we weren't that was not something
 
02:33:19.790 --> 02:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:23.450 --> 02:33:23.460 align:start position:0%
you'd have to change the uh
 
02:33:26.450 --> 02:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
the form also to indicate that those
 
02:33:28.370 --> 02:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
things are on the form
 
02:33:31.370 --> 02:33:31.380 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to add um would
 
02:33:34.190 --> 02:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
it be there many there are many folks
 
02:33:35.929 --> 02:33:35.939 align:start position:0%
that do religiously exempt from
 
02:33:38.150 --> 02:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinations that
 
02:33:40.370 --> 02:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
um would understand the risk of two
 
02:33:42.110 --> 02:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
other children if there were be an
 
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
outbreak so we'd be open to having the
 
02:33:46.429 --> 02:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
list of vaccinations with the check box
 
02:33:48.889 --> 02:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
be optional as a first suggestion
 
02:33:50.570 --> 02:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
because there are folks that don't have
 
02:33:51.770 --> 02:33:51.780 align:start position:0%
a problem of having that information
 
02:33:53.450 --> 02:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
reported to the school nurse but it is
 
02:33:55.550 --> 02:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
important information to have for public
 
02:33:57.590 --> 02:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
health reasons so I would just suggest
 
02:33:59.750 --> 02:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
that if if possible okay for
 
02:34:01.910 --> 02:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you
 
02:34:04.250 --> 02:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
is that acceptable that it's an optional
 
02:34:07.550 --> 02:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:09.710 --> 02:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
I think we really need to see yeah I
 
02:34:11.030 --> 02:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
think Madam chair I think we're getting
 
02:34:12.530 --> 02:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
so deep into the weeds and without
 
02:34:14.510 --> 02:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
seeing a physical form I'm going to con
 
02:34:15.889 --> 02:34:15.899 align:start position:0%
I think I'm gonna stick with my
 
02:34:17.090 --> 02:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
objection and let them come back next
 
02:34:19.250 --> 02:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
month with another conditional approval
 
02:34:22.010 --> 02:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
or some rule or something uh response to
 
02:34:23.630 --> 02:34:23.640 align:start position:0%
the objection so we're making an
 
02:34:26.630 --> 02:34:26.640 align:start position:0%
objection to the form based on they want
 
02:34:27.530 --> 02:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
to see it
 
02:34:29.570 --> 02:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
Senator Francis thank you chair McGuire
 
02:34:31.610 --> 02:34:31.620 align:start position:0%
I just think we need
 
02:34:34.309 --> 02:34:34.319 align:start position:0%
the clean form
 
02:34:36.650 --> 02:34:36.660 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to necessarily object or
 
02:34:38.030 --> 02:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
approve I don't know what the proper
 
02:34:40.190 --> 02:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
Pathway to go is I think that the
 
02:34:42.410 --> 02:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
department already has this in play and
 
02:34:44.929 --> 02:34:44.939 align:start position:0%
now on it feels a little bit
 
02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
respectfully on the fly like we're going
 
02:34:48.469 --> 02:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
to eliminate this we're gonna put this
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
in I agree thank you so so would you
 
02:34:53.929 --> 02:34:53.939 align:start position:0%
would the department be able to have a
 
02:34:58.190 --> 02:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
revised form and a revised rule for our
 
02:35:01.910 --> 02:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
continued meeting on and yes thank you I
 
02:35:04.490 --> 02:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
think that's the best way to go because
 
02:35:06.349 --> 02:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
it sounds like we've more or less
 
02:35:08.330 --> 02:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
reached agreement but we'd all like to
 
02:35:09.770 --> 02:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
confirm that and I do just want to
 
02:35:11.570 --> 02:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
confirm before we go back um so we're on
 
02:35:12.950 --> 02:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
the same page that we will remove those
 
02:35:14.630 --> 02:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
understandings from the form and the
 
02:35:16.849 --> 02:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
rule in make the
 
02:35:19.969 --> 02:35:19.979 align:start position:0%
um vaccinations that you are exempting
 
02:35:22.370 --> 02:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
from being optional
 
02:35:25.490 --> 02:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
um and I trust you will post
 
02:35:27.590 --> 02:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
um you will either take the form off
 
02:35:31.070 --> 02:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
your website or say this is a suggested
 
02:35:33.170 --> 02:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
form you can
 
02:35:35.630 --> 02:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
parents you can just send a letter and I
 
02:35:37.130 --> 02:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
do want to point out if anybody is
 
02:35:38.630 --> 02:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
looking at the administrative rules
 
02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
webpage you will see these forms because
 
02:35:43.250 --> 02:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
we do Post
 
02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
um what we're bringing forward just
 
02:35:46.429 --> 02:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
noting that that it's a little different
 
02:35:49.130 --> 02:35:49.140 align:start position:0%
than program uh web pages to the public
 
02:35:52.370 --> 02:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
on the administrative rules website it's
 
02:35:55.250 --> 02:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
clearly the yes proposal and not the
 
02:35:57.530 --> 02:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
final rule on your website it's what
 
02:35:59.150 --> 02:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
they've got to do to get the kid in
 
02:35:59.160 --> 02:35:59.990 align:start position:0%
they've got to do to get the kid in
school

02:35:59.990 --> 02:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:36:02.090 --> 02:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
so it will be posted twice on our
 
02:36:05.210 --> 02:36:05.220 align:start position:0%
website one on mine specifically almost
 
02:36:08.150 --> 02:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
like how uh OLS post theirs as well okay
 
02:36:10.250 --> 02:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes just a matter of
 
02:36:12.110 --> 02:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
procedure and cleaning up so there's
 
02:36:13.790 --> 02:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
currently a motion and a second on the
 
02:36:18.290 --> 02:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
floor to object and is that and as a is
 
02:36:20.030 --> 02:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
that the proper course so that they can
 
02:36:21.710 --> 02:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
come back and clarify the objection and
 
02:36:23.990 --> 02:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
clarify the rule and clean it up next
 
02:36:27.170 --> 02:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
month yes they have a con I believe they
 
02:36:29.570 --> 02:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
can come forward with a revised
 
02:36:33.730 --> 02:36:33.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:36.410 --> 02:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
if the goal was to postpone to the
 
02:36:38.090 --> 02:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
continued meeting rather than object
 
02:36:40.730 --> 02:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that we're postponing the
 
02:36:43.130 --> 02:36:43.140 align:start position:0%
action on that on that existing motion
 
02:36:45.469 --> 02:36:45.479 align:start position:0%
to the continued beating until we can
 
02:36:47.270 --> 02:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
see what they come up with
 
02:36:49.490 --> 02:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
the continued meeting is October 6th
 
02:36:50.929 --> 02:36:50.939 align:start position:0%
right yeah
 
02:36:53.990 --> 02:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and the motion will remain until
 
02:36:55.610 --> 02:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
it's taken up so the motion we're
 
02:36:57.469 --> 02:36:57.479 align:start position:0%
picking up is to object unless they come
 
02:36:58.790 --> 02:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
back with something get better that we
 
02:36:58.800 --> 02:36:59.690 align:start position:0%
back with something get better that we
like

02:36:59.690 --> 02:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:37:01.490 --> 02:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
yes is that what I'm understanding yes
 
02:37:02.929 --> 02:37:02.939 align:start position:0%
I'm cool with that
 
02:37:02.939 --> 02:37:04.309 align:start position:0%
I'm cool with that
okay

02:37:04.309 --> 02:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:37:07.969 --> 02:37:07.979 align:start position:0%
agreeable we will await your response
 
02:37:10.849 --> 02:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you is there any
 
02:37:12.710 --> 02:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
other business that needs to be taken
 
02:37:14.630 --> 02:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
care of
 
02:37:16.309 --> 02:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
um just for the committee's benefit I
 
02:37:17.990 --> 02:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to apologize for the all the
 
02:37:20.750 --> 02:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
postponed items we had a backlog from
 
02:37:22.790 --> 02:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
last month and because of Staff
 
02:37:25.790 --> 02:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
illnesses so we have suggested the
 
02:37:27.889 --> 02:37:27.899 align:start position:0%
continued meeting to get rid of that
 
02:37:30.349 --> 02:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
backlog and hopefully we don't have a
 
02:37:32.750 --> 02:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
huge agenda in October
 
02:37:35.270 --> 02:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
we do need to catch up and on that note
 
02:37:37.849 --> 02:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
we have hired somebody to replace Diane
 
02:37:40.849 --> 02:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
she will be starting in two weeks and
 
02:37:42.710 --> 02:37:42.720 align:start position:0%

02:37:45.889 --> 02:37:45.899 align:start position:0%
