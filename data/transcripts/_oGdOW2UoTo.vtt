thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
this amendment looks to clarify the
 
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
situations where warrantless arrests are
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
permitted under the committee Amendment
 
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
the committee Amendment mentions actual
 
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
or threatened violence and this
 
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
amendment changes that language to
 
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
specifically reference statutes for
 
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
assault domestic violence and criminal
 
00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.169 align:start position:0%

further the committee Amendment broadly
 
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
Scopes the justifiable scenario for
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
arrests to include interfering with
 
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
quote services that that a licensed
 
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
Medical Professional has determined to
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
be medically necessary
 
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
what we've learned over the last couple
 
00:20:13.549 --> 00:20:13.559 align:start position:0%
years is that medically necessary is
 
00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
much more of a moving gold post than
 
00:20:16.909 --> 00:20:16.919 align:start position:0%
you'd assume
 
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0%
this amendment will clarify that by
 
00:20:21.169 --> 00:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
by more appropriately referencing
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
statute for emergency care I believe
 
00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
expanding the authority of police to
 
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
make warrantless arrests as dangerous to
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
Liberty and adding text to this section
 
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
of RSA should be extremely precise
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
and only when absolutely necessary
 
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
please support this amendment by

um
 
00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
what this bill does
 
00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately I have to take this
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
very seriously one of our one of our own
 
00:20:59.090 --> 00:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
members isn't here today because of the
 
00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:00.539 align:start position:0%
situation that this bill brings up
 
00:21:03.049 --> 00:21:03.059 align:start position:0%
representative agent
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
what this bill does
 
00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
is if you assault or threaten violence
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
in a hospital
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
and it interrupts medically necessary
 
00:21:15.529 --> 00:21:15.539 align:start position:0%
care you can be arrested when the police
 
00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
get there
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
now the interrupts necessary care I put
 
00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:23.820 align:start position:0%
in there to protect citizens that means
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
if you're in the waiting room and
 
00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:27.059 align:start position:0%
someone says hey put your mask on and
 
00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
you say make me put my mask on you can't
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
be arrested because you're not
 
00:21:33.409 --> 00:21:33.419 align:start position:0%
interrupting Medical Care you have to be
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
interrupting Medical Care necessary in
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
medical care
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
to be arrested under the statute as it
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
stands now you can be getting treated
 
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
punch your doctor in the nose
 
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
the police can get there they can't do a
 
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
darn thing they have to go get a warrant
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
come back and by federal law they still
 
00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
have to treat you they can't kick you
 
00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
out of the hospital
 
00:22:00.289 --> 00:22:00.299 align:start position:0%
all this does is let the police get
 
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
there and say when you're finished being
 
00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
cared for you are under arrest and it
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
protects the hospital we have left our
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
our medical providers hanging in the
 
00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
wind during covert they were Heroes and
 
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:15.780 align:start position:0%
now we don't even want to protect them
 
00:22:18.529 --> 00:22:18.539 align:start position:0%
we need to do what we can but I agree
 
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
not giving too much power the original
 
00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:23.940 align:start position:0%
Bill we got from the Senate had the
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
ability of a hospital janitor to hold
 
00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
you until the police got there and that
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
was ridiculous we tuned this down as far
 
00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:32.039 align:start position:0%
as we could go
 
00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
to still allow the police to protect the
 
00:22:36.049 --> 00:22:36.059 align:start position:0%
Medical Care Professionals
 
00:22:39.049 --> 00:22:39.059 align:start position:0%
and not let citizens be unnecessarily
 
00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
held or their Liberties interrupted
 
00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
again it has to be
 
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
interrupting necessary medical care that
 
00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
means not at the front door not in the
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
waiting room not anything else unless
 
00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
you interrupt someone picture one of
 
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
your family members this is in a car
 
00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
accident and your child is getting
 
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
service in the Next Room and the doctor
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
can't tend to them because some drunk
 
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:05.940 align:start position:0%
has punched a doctor in the face
 
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.000 align:start position:0%

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:38.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
the eyes have in the committee of
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
members had adopted the motion before us
 
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
now was ought to pass with Amendment the
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and good morning
 
00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.710 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and good morning
colleagues

00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
I've taken the unusual step this morning
 
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
of signing up to be a second speaker on
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
a bill and against this bill
 
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
uh something I hope to not make a habit
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
of but I feel very strongly about this
 
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
bill and you need to hear why
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
first of all we did hear rather we did
 
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:19.860 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee on this bill we
 
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
entertained and heard expert testimony
 
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:27.500 align:start position:0%
we heard that this bill which modifies
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
the language and existing law to exempt
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
certain social media uses and platforms
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
from the definition of social media such
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
that they can be brought in as parts of
 
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:48.529 --> 00:25:48.539 align:start position:0%
so we heard that this bill will subject
 
00:25:48.539 --> 00:25:49.730 align:start position:0%
so we heard that this bill will subject
students

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
to the potential danger of private
 
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
messages enabling Predators potentially
 
00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:56.220 align:start position:0%
contact students
 
00:25:59.810 --> 00:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
we heard from the standpoint of data and
 
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
privacy that there could in fact be
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
breaches of student data and privacy and
 
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:07.980 align:start position:0%
there is no real recourse because this
 
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
bill is particularly aimed at one
 
00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.210 align:start position:0%
bill is particularly aimed at one
platform

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
platform
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
the LinkedIn platform though it could
 
00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
apply to any platform but Microsoft
 
00:26:18.049 --> 00:26:18.059 align:start position:0%
owning the LinkedIn platform will not
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
negotiate a data agreement we have to go
 
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
with a standard data agreement which
 
00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:23.940 align:start position:0%
waives basically all of all of the
 
00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
finally as far as the major problems
 
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
here this bill would Place students
 
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
within the context of their Public
 
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
School classes under the terms of
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
service of third-party social media that
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
includes speech codes and codes that can
 
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
restrict freedom of Association it would
 
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
subject them to any number of punitive
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
things that could interrupt their
 
00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
coursework and I'd like to make a couple
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
points just from very recent history in
 
00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:01.140 align:start position:0%
the news that really articulate this
 
00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:03.980 align:start position:0%
point first of all the LinkedIn platform
 
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
kicked off the third major GOP Contender
 
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
for the Republican presidency primary
 
00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago removed from their
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
platform for criticizing the Chinese
 
00:27:18.409 --> 00:27:18.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.289 --> 00:27:21.299 align:start position:0%
LinkedIn has been linked to federally
 
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
sponsored censorship in coordination
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
with the state department
 
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
finally just yesterday our governor
 
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
issued an executive order regarding the
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
negative effects social media has on the
 
00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:39.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
there's no need for this bill
 
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.390 align:start position:0%
there's no need for this bill
the

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
the items the badges that they can
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
access through social media are not
 
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
industry recognized credentials they
 
00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:55.860 align:start position:0%
don't do anything to certify you as
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
capable of doing a job they're simply
 
00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
quizzes that you take online that if
 
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
they desire to they can certainly do
 
00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
from home they do not need to be a part
 
00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
of any classroom study
 
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
and finally the things that they do need
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
to access in the classroom through
 
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
digital platforms that are not social
 
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
media they can already access under
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
there is no upside to this bill it is
 
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
all downside I would ask you to protect
 
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech and Association for
 
00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
schools and students
 
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
by voting no
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
or uh yes by voting though and allowing
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
another motion to be made thank you
 
00:28:48.409 --> 00:28:48.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and I Echo the
 
00:28:54.409 --> 00:28:54.419 align:start position:0%
remarks of my colleague from wakefields
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
my professional social media accounts
 
00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:02.220 align:start position:0%
have had not one not two but three false
 
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
suspensions and within the past few
 
00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
weeks have been impersonated twice
 
00:29:12.169 --> 00:29:12.179 align:start position:0%
this means someone is pretending to be
 
00:29:12.179 --> 00:29:14.210 align:start position:0%
this means someone is pretending to be
me

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:14.220 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
partly due to these recent events I am
 
00:29:18.169 --> 00:29:18.179 align:start position:0%
speaking today
 
00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
because it takes someone of my
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
generation to protect those even younger
 
00:29:27.769 --> 00:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
from falling victim to harmful predators
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 213 fails to recognize that
 
00:29:36.529 --> 00:29:36.539 align:start position:0%
child safety is Paramount instead
 
00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
students would be subjected to the whims
 
00:29:41.649 --> 00:29:41.659 align:start position:0%
of Technology manufacturers
 
00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
completely outside the Realms of
 
00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.130 align:start position:0%
completely outside the Realms of
Education

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
Education
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
school districts are unable to negotiate
 
00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:52.860 align:start position:0%
with third-party social media platforms
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
as a result
 
00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
students are subjected to terms of
 
00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
service that can change at any moment
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
updates could limit speech by penalizing
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
students for ideological beliefs causing
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
the loss of job prospects and further
 
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.810 align:start position:0%
the loss of job prospects and further
consequences

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:13.820 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
adolescents who are still determining
 
00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:19.559 align:start position:0%
personal ideologies should not fear
 
00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
unemployment for current violations of

proving to be a gateway to the Future

credentials
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
these students are more competitive job
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
applicants with lower rates of

Senate Bill 213 hinders the successful
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
CTE model by inhibiting students from

obtaining these credentials

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
intervene even when students safety is
 
00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.570 align:start position:0%
intervene even when students safety is
jeopardized

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
jeopardized
 
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
so if it were to become law Senate Bill
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
213 would needlessly harm children
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
I implore you my distinguished
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
colleagues to join me in voting against
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:00.289 --> 00:32:00.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
213 was a very controversial bill in the
 
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
education committee
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
and you've heard the minority present
 
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
that position
 
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
the language which we have as amended
 
00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
there are three primary points in the
 
00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.169 align:start position:0%
there are three primary points in the
amendment

00:32:15.169 --> 00:32:15.179 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:17.220 align:start position:0%
and the language has been approved by
 
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
legal staff at the Department of
 
00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:22.010 align:start position:0%
legal staff at the Department of
Education

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:24.980 align:start position:0%
first question we have is shall not
 
00:32:27.649 --> 00:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
shall social media
 
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
not apply to platforms used for
 
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
demonstrating evidence in student career
 
00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.590 align:start position:0%
demonstrating evidence in student career
development

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
development
 
00:32:35.889 --> 00:32:35.899 align:start position:0%
so our Career Technical educations
 
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
centers staff directors Etc able to use
 
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:43.140 align:start position:0%
social media as an instrument to help
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
students receive these industry
 
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
recognized credentials which we hope all
 
00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:51.179 align:start position:0%
our students are leaving Career
 
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
Technical education with the curriculum
 
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
in these centers is aligned with
 
00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
industry now
 
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
industry is posting all this on social
 
00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.570 align:start position:0%
industry is posting all this on social
media

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
we're looking at areas such as
 
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
engineering Automotive Health Sciences
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
construction culinary all the services
 
00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
provided through our Center
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
and instruction leads to as I said
 
00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:19.559 align:start position:0%
before these recognized credentials so
 
00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
students leave with a job in hand a good
 
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
paying job at that
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
so why do we need the social media
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
when I was looking at social media today
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
in terms of my grandson who is taking
 
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
courses this summer at talk business
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
school as an internship I had to work
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
through Linkedin to get there
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
and so access to Industry standards is
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
now available on these sites LinkedIn is
 
00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
a business and employment focused social
 
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
media platform platform platform
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
primarily used for professional
 
00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
networking and career development and
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
allows students to post their
 
00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:05.460 align:start position:0%
credentials and employers to post jobs
 
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
and vacancies where these students are
 
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:08.990 align:start position:0%
and vacancies where these students are
looking

00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
looking
 
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
the question arises
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
should a young adult enrolled in a CTE
 
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:17.460 align:start position:0%
program be provided the opportunity to
 
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
obtain an industry recognized credential
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
by using a social media platform and who
 
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
makes this decision
 
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
the second part to the amendment deals
 
00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.129 align:start position:0%
the second part to the amendment deals
with

00:34:31.129 --> 00:34:31.139 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that the minority
 
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.290 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that the minority
presented

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
presented
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
it says written permanent parental
 
00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:42.899 align:start position:0%
permission must be attained by the CTE
 
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
Center in order for a student to be on
 
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
the platform written parental permission
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
not the state saying you can't get on
 
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
who is responsible who has the rights
 
00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
for that education we've debated this on
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
this floor many a Time
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
I believe parents have the right to say
 
00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:04.740 align:start position:0%
yay or nay
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
not the state and not somebody else in
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
this house right here
 
00:35:17.089 --> 00:35:17.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
and there was a discussion about freedom
 
00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
of speech freedom of thought freedom of
 
00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.930 align:start position:0%
of speech freedom of thought freedom of
choice

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
if we don't pass this bill we're
 
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
impinging upon that freedoms that the
 
00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
family is able to make now thirdly in
 
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:35:37.609 --> 00:35:37.619 align:start position:0%
technology platforms and services used
 
00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
by students at the CTE Center must be
 
00:35:44.569 --> 00:35:44.579 align:start position:0%
part of the students approved program of
 
00:35:44.579 --> 00:35:46.250 align:start position:0%
part of the students approved program of
study

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
that means they can't use that platform
 
00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
at all unless it's part of that program
 
00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:55.140 align:start position:0%
and there at the school at that time the
 
00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
student is working on it with that
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
the Lea plans every local Education
 
00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
Agency has to have a policy in place
 
00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
regarding data personal privacy and use
 
00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
of these platforms and that's a
 
00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
requirement that every District must
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
have so it's a local control issue and
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
they are working on this with a
 
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
Consortium amongst all the school
 
00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.109 align:start position:0%
Consortium amongst all the school
districts

00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
so in summary
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
guard rails have been put in place
 
00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
for use of any online platform while
 
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
you're at school
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
platforms must be approved as part of
 
00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
the approved program of study
 
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
parental permission
 
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
opt in not opt out opt-in that means a
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
written form has to be signed by parent
 
00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
for a student to use this while in that
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
CTE course
 
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment has been approved by two
 
00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.609 align:start position:0%
the amendment has been approved by two
attorneys

00:36:58.609 --> 00:36:58.619 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Education
 
00:37:04.609 --> 00:37:04.619 align:start position:0%
it's been requested by our CTE directors
 
00:37:08.329 --> 00:37:08.339 align:start position:0%
by our staff by the CT advisory Council
 
00:37:11.089 --> 00:37:11.099 align:start position:0%
by various businesses
 
00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
we need these folks to come out of
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
schools with a credential a certificate
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
in hand
 
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
and by doing this with a supervisor at
 
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
school there's less opportunity for a
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
student to get into trouble
 
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
and get in somewhere that's not safe
 
00:37:35.569 --> 00:37:35.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:37.609 --> 00:37:37.619 align:start position:0%
reality high school students are already
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
using these platforms this amendment
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
tightens online platform use in
 
00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
accordance with the pro programs that we
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
have in the school district or we have
 
00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
in statute here
 
00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:52.140 align:start position:0%
so it is a local control issue
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
and this amendment only carves out one
 
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
exception and that's for a Career
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
Technical education
 
00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:03.300 align:start position:0%
and we need more students more people in
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
the state coming out prepared for this
 
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
the careers
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
that we need filled in this state right
 
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
now so please support this bill by
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
pressing the green button thank you
 
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested members
 
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:37.980 align:start position:0%

it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
00:39:26.089 --> 00:39:26.099 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker
 
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
if I believe that schools should not be
 
00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
promoting the usage of social media
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
especially considering the recently
 
00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:55.740 align:start position:0%
issued executive order by the governor

thank you Mr Speaker being a new
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
legislator the process of getting to
 
00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
this point was quite disappointing I
 
00:50:57.530 --> 00:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
know the environment and agricultural
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee has been down the setbacks for
 
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
landfills road with several bills over
 
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
the last few years the most recent was
 
00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
HB 56 that was overwhelmingly passed by
 
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
this body 244 to 155 but was
 
00:51:14.569 --> 00:51:14.579 align:start position:0%
subsequently itl by the other side of
 
00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
the wall
 
00:51:18.109 --> 00:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
the pressure coming in to do something
 
00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
now feels like a fire burning that needs
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
to be put out not to be confused with
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
the three Solid Waste facilities that
 
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
were on fire over the past few weeks in
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
New England let's be clear that we were
 
00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
told by the experts at DES that a new
 
00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
landfilled in New Hampshire will not be
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
needed for at least 20 years maybe 30 or
 
00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
more with the food waste in composting
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
initiatives and solutions that are
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
finally coming to fruition in New
 
00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.230 align:start position:0%
finally coming to fruition in New
Hampshire

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
why is there such an urgency to push
 
00:51:54.049 --> 00:51:54.059 align:start position:0%
through a bill that is inherently flawed
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
that is the million dollar question for
 
00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:57.900 align:start position:0%
which I believe we can all conclude the
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
answer my Amendment fixes many of the
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
critical red flags in SB 61.
 
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
our committee witnessed incredible
 
00:52:09.069 --> 00:52:09.079 align:start position:0%
disrespect from unelected unaccounted
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
unaccountable bureaucrats threatening
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
vetoes if there were any changes made to
 
00:52:17.089 --> 00:52:17.099 align:start position:0%
SB 61 and one gentleman from the agency
 
00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:20.420 align:start position:0%
saying his stakeholder was the governor
 
00:52:23.809 --> 00:52:23.819 align:start position:0%
the time money and energy to run for
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
state representative and to subsequently
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
be elected and serve to then watch a
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
bill get pushed through which removes
 
00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:33.660 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight and Authority was
 
00:52:35.809 --> 00:52:35.819 align:start position:0%
what brought me here
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
I haven't slept I've worked on this for
 
00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:41.339 align:start position:0%
for weeks our stakeholders are the
 
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire that put their
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
trust in us to make sure that unelected
 
00:52:48.829 --> 00:52:48.839 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats and Industry Gatekeepers
 
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
aren't making laws that we were elected
 
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
to do for the real stakeholders that's
 
00:52:56.809 --> 00:52:56.819 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire
 
00:52:59.450 --> 00:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
would we Outsource the determination of
 
00:53:01.309 --> 00:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
a state speed limit to a private
 
00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
consultant we all know the answer to
 
00:53:05.569 --> 00:53:05.579 align:start position:0%
that question there's also some
 
00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:07.740 align:start position:0%
constitutional questions that come into
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
play with SB 61 because the general
 
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
court is not allowed to delegate their
 
00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:13.849 align:start position:0%
court is not allowed to delegate their
Authority

00:53:13.849 --> 00:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh to another body as well as there's
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
some taxation without representation
 
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
implications as well
 
00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
sb61 is based on the false premise that
 
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
there is more science to study here
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
there is plenty of controversy but all
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
of the science on this specific topic is
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
actually settled SB 61 outsources a
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
fully legislative policy and that
 
00:53:42.589 --> 00:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
responsibility to a private consultant
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
this amendment changes my Amendment
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
changes so that this study gets reported
 
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
back to the legislature
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
during our committee meeting this
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
amendment was introduced and received a
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
vote bipartisan of 10 to 10. there were
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
four absences on the committee that day
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
so one can assume that if this amendment
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
would have received more support as the
 
00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
previous Amendment did I rise in strong
 
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
support of the the minor but critical
 
00:54:13.609 --> 00:54:13.619 align:start position:0%
changes my amendment makes to SB 61. our
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
constituents only want clean water and
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
non-toxic living environments for
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
themselves and their families
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
many of these constituents have
 
00:54:23.569 --> 00:54:23.579 align:start position:0%
diligently and respectfully contacted
 
00:54:25.849 --> 00:54:25.859 align:start position:0%
our committee been in attendance at
 
00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
committee meetings and have considerable
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
and diverse expertise on this subject
 
00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
why did SB 61 exclude people in the
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
study that had other expertise than a
 
00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
thicker piece of plastic wrap will do
 
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
the trick
 
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
maybe ones that might show greater
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
forethought than the new Titanic is
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
better than the old because we wrapped
 
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
the new one in plastic
 
00:54:50.089 --> 00:54:50.099 align:start position:0%
this amendment puts environmental
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
science back in the room with the
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
industry related Engineers to execute a
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
study which will help Direct Des
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
in the rule making
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
in the rulemaking for news site-specific
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
setback rules all with keeping a Smart
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
Balance of respecting industry needs and
 
00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
the health and well-being of New
 
00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens
 
00:55:14.569 --> 00:55:14.579 align:start position:0%
my Amendment also helps to rule out
 
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
undue technocratic bias the language
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
previously favored contracts that design
 
00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
and construction that design and
 
00:55:24.049 --> 00:55:24.059 align:start position:0%
construct landfills it is well known
 
00:55:26.809 --> 00:55:26.819 align:start position:0%
that such firms invariably tilt towards
 
00:55:28.849 --> 00:55:28.859 align:start position:0%
the conclusion that landfills are so
 
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
well engineered that it doesn't matter
 
00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
where they are located to counteract
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
this bias my amendment requires that
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
contractors have experiences not only in
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
land landfill engineering and
 
00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
hydrogeology but in also in identifying
 
00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
and evaluating environmental and health
 
00:55:46.619 --> 00:55:47.750 align:start position:0%
and evaluating environmental and health
risks

00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
risks
 
00:55:49.849 --> 00:55:49.859 align:start position:0%
this is critical because some
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
contractors put so much faith in the
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
power of Technology they fail to
 
00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
adequately recognize the consequences of
 
00:55:58.609 --> 00:55:58.619 align:start position:0%
Technology failure
 
00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
the best contractor will be the one that
 
00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:01.609 align:start position:0%
the best contractor will be the one that
gives

00:56:01.609 --> 00:56:01.619 align:start position:0%
gives
 
00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
due consideration to the limits of
 
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
landfill technology and the benefits of
 
00:56:09.609 --> 00:56:09.619 align:start position:0%
equitably managing environmental risks
 
00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
lastly and most importantly the number
 
00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
two reason for my Amendment
 
00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
the language in SB 61 which was not
 
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
changed in the previous Amendment
 
00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
if the department does not adopt rules
 
00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
in accordance with Section 3 and 4 of
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
this act within 24 months of the
 
00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
effective date of this act the
 
00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:33.260 align:start position:0%
department shall apply its current rules
 
00:56:36.049 --> 00:56:36.059 align:start position:0%
applicable to surface water protection
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
in determining the required setback to
 
00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
any application for such a standard
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
permit that is being held in advance
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
when such 24-month period expires and
 
00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
approve it if it complies with current
 
00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.230 align:start position:0%
approve it if it complies with current
rules

00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:56:53.809 --> 00:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
we were told that if we change this
 
00:56:55.790 --> 00:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
specific language in the bill
 
00:56:57.890 --> 00:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
it would be vetoed or killed by the
 
00:56:59.030 --> 00:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
other body
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
why would we ever pass a bill that says
 
00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:05.640 align:start position:0%
we are commanding a study that taxpayers
 
00:57:08.089 --> 00:57:08.099 align:start position:0%
are going to pay for that study whether
 
00:57:11.809 --> 00:57:11.819 align:start position:0%
it's 150 000 or 200 000 dollars
 
00:57:11.819 --> 00:57:13.430 align:start position:0%
it's 150 000 or 200 000 dollars
and

00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
we the legislature have no oversight
 
00:57:20.089 --> 00:57:20.099 align:start position:0%
once that said study is completed but if
 
00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
after the study that we the people paid
 
00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
for to help determine new rules if Des
 
00:57:29.089 --> 00:57:29.099 align:start position:0%
doesn't adopt new rules in 24 months we
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
can go back to the old non-site specific
 
00:57:34.849 --> 00:57:34.859 align:start position:0%
rules this is a circular firing squad
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
statement and completely rendered the
 
00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:38.940 align:start position:0%
bill useless
 
00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
my change was simple
 
00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:43.140 align:start position:0%
if the department does not adopt rules
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
in accordance with section three and
 
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
four of this act within 24 months of the
 
00:57:48.829 --> 00:57:48.839 align:start position:0%
effective date of this act the
 
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
department shall hold any application
 
00:57:54.109 --> 00:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
for such a standard permit in a bands
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
until such rules are adopted
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
isn't it time to put Common Sense back
 
00:58:02.329 --> 00:58:02.339 align:start position:0%
into an issue that will affect New
 
00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:04.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens for decades centuries
 
00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
to come
 
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't this what we were elected to do
 
00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
it is time to be brave and make doing
 
00:58:13.549 --> 00:58:13.559 align:start position:0%
the right thing popular again
 
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:31.069 --> 00:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
hi there I am representative Wendy
 
00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
Thomas and I ask for your support on
 
00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
this very important floor Amendment
 
00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's not easy being a
 
00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:39.950 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's not easy being a
legislator

00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
we have to balance so many needs the
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
needs of our constituents the businesses
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
in the state the welfares of others and
 
00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes we even have to balance what
 
00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
those and other the in the other
 
00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
branches of government want sometimes it
 
00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
can be difficult
 
00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
but sometimes it's very easy as it is in
 
00:59:01.309 --> 00:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
the case of this amendment
 
00:59:03.049 --> 00:59:03.059 align:start position:0%
when we know we are making a bill
 
00:59:05.329 --> 00:59:05.339 align:start position:0%
stronger when we know that People's
 
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
Health and Welfare will benefit and when
 
00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
we know that our environment will be
 
00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:13.140 align:start position:0%
protected it's easy to do
 
00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:15.900 align:start position:0%
in fact it's the reason why we are up
 
00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:16.789 align:start position:0%
in fact it's the reason why we are up
here

00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
to make good law and to help protect
 
00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:20.930 align:start position:0%
to make good law and to help protect
others

00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:20.940 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
this amendment to SB 61 simply clarifies
 
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
some terms and conditions that have been
 
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
left so intentionally vague that if one
 
00:59:34.849 --> 00:59:34.859 align:start position:0%
wanted to one could drive a truck maybe
 
00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
even a garbage truck through them
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
when a bill as important as where to
 
00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
place a landfill that will create toxic
 
00:59:45.289 --> 00:59:45.299 align:start position:0%
leachate which could lead to
 
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:47.579 align:start position:0%
environmental contamination does not
 
00:59:50.569 --> 00:59:50.579 align:start position:0%
consider all scientific or safety
 
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
concerns which are needed to provide
 
00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:54.180 align:start position:0%
safety for the people who live near
 
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
there and the environment including
 
00:59:59.089 --> 00:59:59.099 align:start position:0%
Wildlife then it's wrong
 
01:00:01.789 --> 01:00:01.799 align:start position:0%
when the bill outsources site-specific
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
setback analysis to a currently unknown
 
01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
consultant instead of performing it
 
01:00:12.049 --> 01:00:12.059 align:start position:0%
in-house then Houston we have a problem
 
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:14.700 align:start position:0%
this bipartisan Amendment recognizes
 
01:00:16.849 --> 01:00:16.859 align:start position:0%
those holes and defines vague
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
terminology and sets guard rails in
 
01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:20.870 align:start position:0%
terminology and sets guard rails in
others

01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:00:23.569 --> 01:00:23.579 align:start position:0%
so what does this amendment do that the
 
01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:25.980 align:start position:0%
previous Amendment does not
 
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
Federal Environmental laws generally
 
01:00:31.309 --> 01:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
seek to protect Public Health with quote
 
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
an ample margin of safety
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
but SB 61 only seeks to protect New
 
01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Waters quote adequately
 
01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
this amendment fixes that discrepancy on
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
page 2 line 27 and puts this bill in
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
line with Federal standards
 
01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:53.000 align:start position:0%
on page 2 line 32 it defines the term
 
01:00:56.329 --> 01:00:56.339 align:start position:0%
representative with travel time and its
 
01:00:58.849 --> 01:00:58.859 align:start position:0%
variable across the site
 
01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
this has been added because the previous
 
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
phrase representative in terms of
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
groundwater speed
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
without more definition of the actual
 
01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:09.839 align:start position:0%
conditions is something that can
 
01:01:12.049 --> 01:01:12.059 align:start position:0%
completely be determined by the
 
01:01:12.059 --> 01:01:13.250 align:start position:0%
completely be determined by the
developer

01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
developer
 
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
on page three line four the amendment
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
changes a shall to a May one of our
 
01:01:20.569 --> 01:01:20.579 align:start position:0%
favorite changes to make
 
01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
as in the department may take into
 
01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:26.220 align:start position:0%
account any measures proposed in the
 
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
application for a permit that would
 
01:01:30.349 --> 01:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
provide greater or more redundant
 
01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:32.700 align:start position:0%
production of perennial surface water
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
than the department would otherwise
 
01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
require under its rules
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
this change gives Des the option to
 
01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
consider or to not consider a proposal
 
01:01:46.609 --> 01:01:46.619 align:start position:0%
or part of a proposal
 
01:01:50.329 --> 01:01:50.339 align:start position:0%
page 3 line 20 lines 28 through 31 have
 
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
been changed to further Define the
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
permit application proposal and if the
 
01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
department relies on those measures then
 
01:01:59.870 --> 01:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
the department shall require
 
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
implementation of those measures as a
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
condition to any permit
 
01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
this change simply ensures that Des
 
01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
relies on measures and that those
 
01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
measures are implemented in the process
 
01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
we are asking the Department of
 
01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services to walk their
 
01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:20.569 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services to walk their
walk

01:02:20.569 --> 01:02:20.579 align:start position:0%
walk
 
01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
on page 4 lines six through nine there
 
01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
is language that proposes a statement of
 
01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:28.140 align:start position:0%
any potential conflicts of interest with
 
01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
any entity that may benefit from any
 
01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:33.059 align:start position:0%
change in setback requirements and that
 
01:02:35.089 --> 01:02:35.099 align:start position:0%
any preference be given to proposals
 
01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
that demonstrate the qualified
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
consulting firm or individuals have
 
01:02:42.770 --> 01:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
credentials and experience in evaluating
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
the health
 
01:02:47.329 --> 01:02:47.339 align:start position:0%
and safety risks associated with
 
01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protections as well as the
 
01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
engineering and hydrogeological aspect
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
of landfill design and sighting
 
01:02:58.730 --> 01:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
this change has been made has been added
 
01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the health and safety
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
risks are fully considered in all
 
01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:07.140 align:start position:0%
aspects it also allows Des to consider
 
01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
whether the consultant has expertise in
 
01:03:11.569 --> 01:03:11.579 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
not only in landfill science
 
01:03:17.089 --> 01:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
it makes sure that the right people are
 
01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
the ones who are doing the job
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
page 4 lines 19-20 the term adequate is
 
01:03:25.609 --> 01:03:25.619 align:start position:0%
again defined as protect perennial
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
surface water with an ample margin of
 
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
safety again this change brings the bill
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
to Federal standards
 
01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:37.140 align:start position:0%
page four aligns 28-30 add the
 
01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
recommendation that soil bedrock
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
proximity demographics or other factors
 
01:03:44.809 --> 01:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
that would render a particular proposal
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
new land find site landfill site
 
01:03:50.569 --> 01:03:50.579 align:start position:0%
absolutely unsuitable for development
 
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
other United States
 
01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
have thriving landfill Industries
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
despite regulations that absolutely
 
01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
forbid new landfills in super porous
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
sandy soil
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment asks the consultant to at
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
least consider whether similar
 
01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
protections might make sense for New
 
01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:10.910 align:start position:0%
protections might make sense for New
Hampshire

01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:04:14.329 --> 01:04:14.339 align:start position:0%

01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
page four aligns 31-36 continuing to

01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
contractor shall complete the assessment
 
01:04:27.049 --> 01:04:27.059 align:start position:0%
and submit a final report to the Senate
 
01:04:30.289 --> 01:04:30.299 align:start position:0%
energy and natural resources committee
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%

this is Perhaps Perhaps the biggest

01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
the final report would not go to Des but
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
instead it would go to the Senate and
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
legislature so that we could use it to
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
make recommendations for legislation or
 
01:04:59.450 --> 01:04:59.460 align:start position:0%

comment
 
01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
don't you think our constituents have a
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
thing or two to say about landfills
 
01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
being located near large bodies of water
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
or near them in their communities
 
01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
we know that landfills leak we know that
 
01:05:17.329 --> 01:05:17.339 align:start position:0%
people can get sick from exposure to
 
01:05:18.589 --> 01:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
these leachates
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
my town is living proof of this
 
01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
without proper protections water gets
 
01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
contaminated and people get sick
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
on page five line 14 there is removal of
 
01:05:32.450 --> 01:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
the 24-month Restriction after the
 
01:05:35.089 --> 01:05:35.099 align:start position:0%
effective date of this act and on page 5
 
01:05:37.370 --> 01:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
line 24 through 25 there is a
 
01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
stipulation that the department shall
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
hold any application for such a standard
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
permit in advance until such rules are
 
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.190 align:start position:0%
permit in advance until such rules are
adopted

01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
these changes were added because it just
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
makes sense why proceed before you have
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
definite rules
 
01:05:56.450 --> 01:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
okay so why are all these seemingly
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
nitpicky changes being made it's because
 
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
we can't mess around with this folks
 
01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
this bill is about where landfills which
 
01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
are piles and piles of potentially toxic
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
garbage are going to be located and we
 
01:06:13.849 --> 01:06:13.859 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that the people who
 
01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
are making the decision receive fair
 
01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
unbiased and scientific information on
 
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
any proposed locations
 
01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
we also need to make sure that the
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
people environment and Wildlife are
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
fully considered in this very important
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
decision look garbage is a way of life
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
and until we change that we will need
 
01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
landfills however these landfills must
 
01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
be placed where they can do the least
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
harm to communities and our environment
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
the house already passed a perfectly
 
01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
good bill that would have solved this
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
landfill citing problem however in the
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
branch across the wall they turn this
 
01:06:58.370 --> 01:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
into a study fine if you want to study
 
01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
then let's have a study however
 
01:07:03.650 --> 01:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
toxic runoff and leachate from landfills
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
is quite frankly a danger and a threat
 
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
to public and environmental safety we
 
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
must put in the proper guideline
 
01:07:14.210 --> 01:07:14.220 align:start position:0%
guardrails to ensure that every possible
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
point is considered
 
01:07:19.130 --> 01:07:19.140 align:start position:0%
let's make sure that that's that that
 
01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
study is well defined and well thought
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
out and that the process is fair and
 
01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:25.789 align:start position:0%
out and that the process is fair and
complete

01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
complete
 
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
let's give the Senate and the governor
 
01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
the study they want but let's make sure
 
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
it directs the Consultants to report to
 
01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:33.829 align:start position:0%
it directs the Consultants to report to
us

01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:07:37.549 --> 01:07:37.559 align:start position:0%
the legislature for our consent or
 
01:07:37.559 --> 01:07:39.109 align:start position:0%
the legislature for our consent or
modification

01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
modification
 
01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
this amendment does that it lets us do
 
01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
our job
 
01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
I urge you to support this well thought
 
01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
out and bipartisan Amendment which puts
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
the guard rails in place that are needed
 
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
when considering where to place
 
01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
potentially toxic and health and
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
environmental altering landfills in our
 
01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
beautiful state of New Hampshire thank
 
01:08:01.319 --> 01:08:02.990 align:start position:0%
beautiful state of New Hampshire thank
you

01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:08:10.609 --> 01:08:10.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:13.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I rise today
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
admittedly reluctant in my support and
 
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:19.980 align:start position:0%
I'll explain why my support is is
 
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
somewhat reluctance we've heard a lot we
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
know a lot already about how we got to
 
01:08:25.729 --> 01:08:25.739 align:start position:0%
this point we had a perfectly good bill
 
01:08:29.809 --> 01:08:29.819 align:start position:0%
that had specific setback rules that we
 
01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:31.140 align:start position:0%
passed in this house with broad
 
01:08:33.769 --> 01:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support it was killed on the
 
01:08:35.809 --> 01:08:35.819 align:start position:0%
other side of the wall
 
01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:40.259 align:start position:0%
we received SB 61
 
01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
one of the greatest virtues I think one
 
01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
of the things that made me want to work
 
01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
as hard as we could to get this bill
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
through is the importance of the
 
01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
abeyance a two-year abeyance while the
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
rule writing process took place I tried
 
01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
really hard
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
I know that everyone on our committee
 
01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.490 align:start position:0%
I know that everyone on our committee
did

01:08:58.490 --> 01:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
I have great admiration and respect for
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
our leadership on both sides of the
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
aisle in our committee for all of the
 
01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
efforts that were made with all of the
 
01:09:09.769 --> 01:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
various stakeholders to make a bill that
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't very good quite frankly a bad
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
bill for the people of the State of New
 
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire better unfortunately at the
 
01:09:19.249 --> 01:09:19.259 align:start position:0%
very last hearing that we had
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of straws that broke
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
that camel's back and in the end I
 
01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:25.020 align:start position:0%
concluded that I could not support the
 
01:09:26.809 --> 01:09:26.819 align:start position:0%
bill as written and I want to share with
 
01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
you just two reasons among many
 
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
why in the end I cannot support the bill
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
is written and uh I rise today in
 
01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:37.799 align:start position:0%
support of this amendment they've both
 
01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
been referred to before so I won't go
 
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
into detail but the first is is an
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
important change of language that the
 
01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
bill is written contains reference to
 
01:09:50.329 --> 01:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
adequate protections for bodies of water
 
01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
we wanted to have based on Expert
 
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
testimony we wanted that language change
 
01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
to language that reflects the Clean
 
01:09:59.570 --> 01:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
Water Act which calls for an ample
 
01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
margin of safety
 
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
we were told that that was a no-go that
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
change of language ample margin of
 
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
safety by the industry that this bill is
 
01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
supposed to regulate we were told was a
 
01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:16.130 align:start position:0%
supposed to regulate we were told was a
no-go

01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
no-go
 
01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:17.630 align:start position:0%
no-go
likewise

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
likewise
 
01:10:19.729 --> 01:10:19.739 align:start position:0%
the language that my colleague just
 
01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
referred to about representative travel
 
01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
time of groundwater
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
we want it that's that's a pretty vague
 
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
word representative I could drill 10
 
01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
times or 50 times in a 50 Fair 50 square
 
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
foot plot where I know I'm going to get
 
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
the readings I want and I can submit
 
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
that as being representative of the site
 
01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
we ask that wording be changed that
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
would refer to
 
01:10:45.719 --> 01:10:46.750 align:start position:0%
would refer to
um

01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
variation across the site so that you
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
would have to drill in lots of different
 
01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
places across that site and get
 
01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
scientific data that was genuinely
 
01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
representative of the site not
 
01:10:59.930 --> 01:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
cherry-picked data again we were told by
 
01:11:01.729 --> 01:11:01.739 align:start position:0%
the industry that is supposed to be
 
01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:04.140 align:start position:0%
regulated by this legislation that that
 
01:11:05.689 --> 01:11:05.699 align:start position:0%
was a no-go
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
and that was the straw that broke the
 
01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
camel's back for me
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
we have a rule writing process that is
 
01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:15.780 align:start position:0%
going forward and I sincerely hope that
 
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
my colleagues whom I admire whom I
 
01:11:19.729 --> 01:11:19.739 align:start position:0%
respect whose hard work I'm grateful for
 
01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
I sincerely hope that they're right that
 
01:11:24.649 --> 01:11:24.659 align:start position:0%
the oversight that this committee has
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
the authority to do
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
the oversight that it is our
 
01:11:30.169 --> 01:11:30.179 align:start position:0%
responsibility to do during the rule
 
01:11:33.050 --> 01:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
writing process I hope that we can use
 
01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:35.460 align:start position:0%
that oversight in order to make sure
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
that the industry does not have the same
 
01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
power to influence the rule writing
 
01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
process that they clearly have had in
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
the writing of legislation
 
01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately based on what I've seen
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
I've absolutely no confidence that that
 
01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
would happen
 
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
the hiring of a consultant to do produce
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
a report we all understand how that can
 
01:11:57.290 --> 01:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
work if any of you have been attending
 
01:11:59.330 --> 01:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
some of the public sessions about the
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
current 306 rule writing process that's
 
01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
a process which is clearly driven toward
 
01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
a predetermined outcome
 
01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
and the result in the end will not be
 
01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
reflective of the needs and the
 
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
interests of the people that we were
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
elected to represent
 
01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
so I I understand that if we adopt this
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
amendment the reality is in all
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
likelihood that it's going to be killed
 
01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the wall or it's
 
01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:26.460 align:start position:0%
going to be killed in the coroner office
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
and that's why I'm really reluctant
 
01:12:32.209 --> 01:12:32.219 align:start position:0%
to support this but I can no longer
 
01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
accept the idea that some Bill any Bill
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
even this bill is better than no bill
 
01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
so I rise today to ask all of you to
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
support this amendment
 
01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:46.739 align:start position:0%
to make this bill reflective of the
 
01:12:48.649 --> 01:12:48.659 align:start position:0%
interests and the needs of the people in
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire thank you Mr
 
01:12:59.090 --> 01:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:03.649 align:start position:0%
 
speaker

01:13:03.649 --> 01:13:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:06.780 align:start position:0%
this floor amendment that is before us
 
01:13:09.290 --> 01:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
while well-intentioned
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
will ultimately kill this much needed
 
01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:13.850 align:start position:0%
will ultimately kill this much needed
bill

01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:13:16.370 --> 01:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
the amendment contains many impediments
 
01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:20.460 align:start position:0%
to SB 61's passage it was not
 
01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
constructed with an eye to get
 
01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
coordinated support from the folks on
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
the other side of the wall or Des or any
 
01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
other interested parties
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
and you and I know that when we do these
 
01:13:36.649 --> 01:13:36.659 align:start position:0%
bills we do work together with a lot of
 
01:13:36.659 --> 01:13:37.729 align:start position:0%
bills we do work together with a lot of
people

01:13:37.729 --> 01:13:37.739 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:13:41.209 --> 01:13:41.219 align:start position:0%
that's the way it works
 
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
it comes before us today placed in your
 
01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
seat Pockets without really being fully
 
01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
reviewed or vetted and furthermore this
 
01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
amendment contains language which is too
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
restrictive to the process of
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
establishing new DES landfill citing
 
01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.430 align:start position:0%
establishing new DES landfill citing
rules

01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:14:01.130 --> 01:14:01.140 align:start position:0%
the amendment before you seeks to make
 
01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:03.179 align:start position:0%
finding a suitable third party to
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
perform a study more restrictive and
 
01:14:07.930 --> 01:14:07.940 align:start position:0%
will surely limit the pool of applicants
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
this bill Amendment will also draw out
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
this process of rulemaking for landfill
 
01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
citing out in a manner which is unending
 
01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment has no real tide table
 
01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
because of the rule making process is
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
not completed in two years then any
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
permits held in abeyance can wait
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
indefinitely until new rules are
 
01:14:32.570 --> 01:14:32.580 align:start position:0%
established this is an open-ended
 
01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
process that can essentially go on
 
01:14:39.290 --> 01:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
forever and forever is not a good plan
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
the minority feels SB 61 is written and
 
01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
amended by the committee doesn't go far
 
01:14:47.330 --> 01:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
enough to ensure Public Safety regarding
 
01:14:49.010 --> 01:14:49.020 align:start position:0%
landfill citing
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
this is simply not true because the
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
original Bill and its committee
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment will definitely help create
 
01:14:58.910 --> 01:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
improvements in our current 30 year old
 
01:15:03.649 --> 01:15:03.659 align:start position:0%
rules additionally Des has told us that
 
01:15:05.689 --> 01:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
they need assistance in performing the
 
01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
kind of analysis required to do the
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
technical groundwork and research to
 
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
create better and more technically
 
01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
robust landfill citing rules the
 
01:15:18.770 --> 01:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
original bill and the committee
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment already accomplishes that
 
01:15:26.810 --> 01:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
this amendment before you if passed
 
01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
will certainly not be acceptable moving
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
on to the next step
 
01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:34.140 align:start position:0%
and if this bill dies then it is
 
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
guaranteed that nothing will get done
 
01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
this year with regard to meaningful
 
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
legislation for landfill citing rule
 
01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
adoption SB 61 is written and amended by
 
01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
the committee is a good bill on its own
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
and will provide Des with the much
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
needed expertise and assistance
 
01:15:58.490 --> 01:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
to update Des landfill citing rules
 
01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:00.350 align:start position:0%
to update Des landfill citing rules
finally

01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
finally
 
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
the rules for citing landfills in New
 
01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are set to expire next year
 
01:16:09.649 --> 01:16:09.659 align:start position:0%
SB 61 with the amendment passed by our
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
committee will assist Des to re-examine
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
its rules regarding landfill setbacks in
 
01:16:20.090 --> 01:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
an efficient and expedient manner
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
we must not lest this chance get
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
slipping away by adding in amending
 
01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:28.140 align:start position:0%
language that will ensure the death of
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:16:32.090 --> 01:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
I implore you to reject this floor
 
01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
Amendment and pass the underlying Bill
 
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
and committee Amendment which is much
 
01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
needed and has already been vetted by

further if I know that 61 does not

require the Department of Environmental

Services to even consider
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
whether a

consultant hired to do this study has

expertise in Environmental Protection

ask the consultant to consider adverse
 
01:19:25.610 --> 01:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
conditions for citing landfills such as
 
01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
super porous soils which other states
 
01:19:33.070 --> 01:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
have done and finally if I know that the
 
01:19:36.890 --> 01:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
legislature which writes the laws to
 
01:19:39.229 --> 01:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
protect Granite Staters
 
01:19:43.130 --> 01:19:43.140 align:start position:0%
should exercise oversight over the study
 
01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
including the right to review
 
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
question and comment on report
 
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
then would I press the green button and
 
01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
vote for the floor amendment that
 
01:19:58.490 --> 01:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
provides these assurances and
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%

01:20:03.649 --> 01:20:03.659 align:start position:0%

01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
floor amendment is well intentioned and
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
highly protective but also creates an
 
01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:15.719 align:start position:0%
open-ended rule writing process and if I
 
01:20:17.330 --> 01:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
also know that many aspects of this
 
01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment were summarily rejected
 
01:20:20.810 --> 01:20:20.820 align:start position:0%

01:20:23.149 --> 01:20:23.159 align:start position:0%

I am going to strongly encourage you to
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
vote no on this bill
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
so this bill is calling for a third
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
party consultancy
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
to advise the Department of

Environmental Services
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:51.229 --> 01:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
Des is our highly trained professionals
 
01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
that we hire and Trust to do this work
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
they are doing
 
01:22:58.910 --> 01:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
this work
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
so what's the problem with getting a
 
01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
Little Help From A consultancy other
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
than blowing two hundred thousand
 
01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:08.270 align:start position:0%
than blowing two hundred thousand
dollars

01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.209 --> 01:23:11.219 align:start position:0%
the pro-industry side
 
01:23:15.050 --> 01:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
is afraid that the consultancy is going
 
01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
to be the Greenies
 
01:23:20.330 --> 01:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
and that we're going to wreak havoc and
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
just put landfills wherever we want
 
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly in New Hampshire
 
01:23:27.770 --> 01:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
the Greenies and I don't mean that in a
 
01:23:29.450 --> 01:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
bad way
 
01:23:31.970 --> 01:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
because I have a I have a green green
 
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:38.209 --> 01:23:38.219 align:start position:0%
but if the Greenies control it the rules
 
01:23:40.729 --> 01:23:40.739 align:start position:0%
are going to be written
 
01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
so that it'll be virtually impossible to
 
01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
cite a landfill anywhere in New
 
01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:47.870 align:start position:0%
cite a landfill anywhere in New
Hampshire

01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
and we hear people bemoan we're
 
01:23:53.630 --> 01:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
importing trash from out of state
 
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
and it's a travesty against New
 
01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:57.770 align:start position:0%
and it's a travesty against New
Hampshire

01:23:57.770 --> 01:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
so let me ask you a question
 
01:24:02.209 --> 01:24:02.219 align:start position:0%
sorry let me ask you a question Mr
 
01:24:02.219 --> 01:24:04.610 align:start position:0%
sorry let me ask you a question Mr
Speaker

01:24:04.610 --> 01:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:13.010 --> 01:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
where does our hazardous material go
 
01:24:16.729 --> 01:24:16.739 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go into landfills
 
01:24:19.970 --> 01:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go into Hazmat mitigation
 
01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
facilities in New Hampshire
 
01:24:24.169 --> 01:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
do you know why
 
01:24:27.169 --> 01:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
because we don't have one
 
01:24:28.970 --> 01:24:28.980 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge most of it
 
01:24:30.770 --> 01:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
goes to Ohio
 
01:24:32.270 --> 01:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
where they have a high temperature
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
incinerator to dispose of such material
 
01:24:38.090 --> 01:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
imagine if Ohio decided we're not going
 
01:24:41.570 --> 01:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
to take New Hampshire's Hazmat anymore
 
01:24:43.850 --> 01:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
that would be a problem
 
01:24:46.189 --> 01:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
a serious problem not to mention it's
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce which is beyond the
 
01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
purview of our control if we can't cite
 
01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:53.870 align:start position:0%
purview of our control if we can't cite
landfills

01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
01:24:57.530 --> 01:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
then we export all of our rubbish
 
01:25:00.770 --> 01:25:00.780 align:start position:0%
to some poor other state
 
01:25:05.209 --> 01:25:05.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's my opinion
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
that our current sighting rules
 
01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
are adequate and sufficient
 
01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
this is all carryover
 
01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
from the Dalton landfill Casella
 
01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
landfill hangover of a couple of years
 
01:25:25.610 --> 01:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
ago that project has been
 
01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
recalled right it's that that is no
 
01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
longer on the table
 
01:25:34.490 --> 01:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
this this bill is going to bite somebody
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
where they don't want to be bitten
 
01:25:39.770 --> 01:25:39.780 align:start position:0%
and the best part of it is it's like
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
rolling the dice we don't know who it's
 
01:25:44.330 --> 01:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
going to bite until after we pass it and
 
01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
somebody else beyond our control hires
 
01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
the consultancy that's going to drive
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:55.130 --> 01:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
is there a stop Gap
 
01:25:57.770 --> 01:25:57.780 align:start position:0%
sure there's a stop cap
 
01:26:00.649 --> 01:26:00.659 align:start position:0%
Joe Carr those rules I assume go to gel
 
01:26:00.659 --> 01:26:02.090 align:start position:0%
Joe Carr those rules I assume go to gel
car

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
car
 
01:26:04.189 --> 01:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
so is
 
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
is that where we want to have this fight
 
01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:09.830 align:start position:0%
is that where we want to have this fight
again

01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:12.050 align:start position:0%
again
or

01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
do we take a more rational reasonable
 
01:26:19.129 --> 01:26:19.139 align:start position:0%
metered approach
 
01:26:21.129 --> 01:26:21.139 align:start position:0%
and in trust the Department of
 
01:26:23.629 --> 01:26:23.639 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services
 
01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
to do that which they have been tasked
 
01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:27.470 align:start position:0%
to do that which they have been tasked
with

01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
and it's interesting because as far as I
 
01:26:31.370 --> 01:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
know and maybe somebody can bring
 
01:26:33.649 --> 01:26:33.659 align:start position:0%
testimony to the contrary but the
 
01:26:35.930 --> 01:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Sciences is
 
01:26:38.209 --> 01:26:38.219 align:start position:0%
not asking in Services is not asking for
 
01:26:38.219 --> 01:26:40.990 align:start position:0%
not asking in Services is not asking for
this

01:26:40.990 --> 01:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
they're not asking for 200 000 to hire a
 
01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
consultant they're quite confident they
 
01:26:49.010 --> 01:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
can do their job without uh interference
 
01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
from from the outside world
 
01:26:53.810 --> 01:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
I say God bless them let's let's let
 
01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
them do
 
01:26:58.189 --> 01:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
the job that we've hired them to do let
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
us trust our highly trained professional
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
administrative staff to do their job
 
01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:07.790 align:start position:0%
administrative staff to do their job
so

01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
if you vote green
 
01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
you're rolling the dice or flipping a
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
coin I guess
 
01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
and so good luck to you me I'm voting
 
01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:19.870 align:start position:0%
and so good luck to you me I'm voting
red

01:27:19.870 --> 01:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
red
 
01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
this bill has opposition from from every
 
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
angle right when when every everybody at
 
01:27:30.229 --> 01:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
the table has a problem with a bill
 
01:27:32.450 --> 01:27:32.460 align:start position:0%
that's not the bill to pass
 
01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:33.590 align:start position:0%
that's not the bill to pass
right

01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:27:36.530 --> 01:27:36.540 align:start position:0%
so I I encourage you to listen to the
 
01:27:38.689 --> 01:27:38.699 align:start position:0%
rest of the debate please consider what
 
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:40.860 align:start position:0%
what I've told you and when the time
 
01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
comes vote red
 
01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
wrote red
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
and kill this Bill thank you
 
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:58.129 --> 01:27:58.139 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
SB 61 deals with the rules for setbacks
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
between new landfills and surface water
 
01:28:02.639 --> 01:28:04.310 align:start position:0%
between new landfills and surface water
bodies

01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:06.300 align:start position:0%
tried to provide highly protective
 
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
guidance for the Department of
 
01:28:10.610 --> 01:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services with HB 56 which
 
01:28:13.570 --> 01:28:13.580 align:start position:0%
was itl'd on the other side of the wall
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
sb61 is the other body's approach to
 
01:28:17.930 --> 01:28:17.940 align:start position:0%
setback rules and our committee has
 
01:28:20.209 --> 01:28:20.219 align:start position:0%
amended it with a few improvements
 
01:28:23.870 --> 01:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
as it came to us SB 61 gave Des two
 
01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
years to make specific setback rules
 
01:28:28.850 --> 01:28:28.860 align:start position:0%
based on site hydrology and Technical
 
01:28:30.410 --> 01:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
measures that increa that increase
 
01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:33.169 align:start position:0%
measures that increa that increase
protection

01:28:33.169 --> 01:28:33.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:36.649 --> 01:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
and at the request of Des who said they
 
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
would not be able to do this uh in the
 
01:28:40.970 --> 01:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
one year that they were that the other
 
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
body was originally thinking of but
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
required two years and that they would
 
01:28:47.050 --> 01:28:47.060 align:start position:0%
not be able to do this without
 
01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
additional Manpower in the form of a
 
01:28:52.490 --> 01:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
consultant which is a short-term fix
 
01:28:55.250 --> 01:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
rather than hiring new Personnel forever
 
01:28:59.870 --> 01:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh and the the Des requested money for
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
the recall consultant in order to make
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
sure that they would be able to provide
 
01:29:10.490 --> 01:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
so another action another very important
 
01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
aspect of SB 161 as it came to us is
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
that all all permits are held in the
 
01:29:21.229 --> 01:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
bands until the rules are in place as
 
01:29:25.129 --> 01:29:25.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
our Amendment adds explicit language
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
that requires disclosure of conflict of
 
01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:31.970 align:start position:0%
that requires disclosure of conflict of
interest

01:29:31.970 --> 01:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
provides a small increase in funding to
 
01:29:36.050 --> 01:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
make sure that the RFP attracts a good
 
01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
selection of well-qualified consultants
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
and allows for 90-day extension of the
 
01:29:43.250 --> 01:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
abeyance in case of in extraordinary
 
01:29:45.169 --> 01:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
circumstances that might prevent the
 
01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
department from completing the rules in
 
01:29:48.770 --> 01:29:48.780 align:start position:0%
within two years
 
01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:53.400 align:start position:0%
if SB 6961 does not pass new landfill
 
01:29:56.030 --> 01:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
permits a new landfill permit
 
01:29:57.649 --> 01:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
applications can be filed almost
 
01:29:59.930 --> 01:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
immediately and will be assessed under
 
01:30:02.530 --> 01:30:02.540 align:start position:0%
the current completely unacceptable
 
01:30:06.169 --> 01:30:06.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:07.970 --> 01:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
the committee amendment was negotiated
 
01:30:09.410 --> 01:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
to strengthen the bill as much as
 
01:30:12.410 --> 01:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
possible without inviting a vote of
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
non-concurrent on the other side of the
 
01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:15.410 align:start position:0%
non-concurrent on the other side of the
wall

01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
wall
 
01:30:17.209 --> 01:30:17.219 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make the bill more
 
01:30:20.689 --> 01:30:20.699 align:start position:0%
protective but we were assured that more
 
01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
stringent languages
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
would in fact cause the bill to fail
 
01:30:28.910 --> 01:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
SB 61 as amended creates a clear process
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
for better rules and most critically it
 
01:30:33.410 --> 01:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
stops all permit approvals within the
 
01:30:36.770 --> 01:30:36.780 align:start position:0%

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:51.290 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:34:51.290 --> 01:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:34:53.629 --> 01:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a roll call vote

01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
discovered later that I had
 
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
misunderstood the effect of the bill and
 
01:35:13.370 --> 01:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
if I want to have an opportunity to
 
01:35:16.729 --> 01:35:16.739 align:start position:0%
support this bill and if I know this
 
01:35:18.770 --> 01:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
would help our County nursing homes
 
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
would I now press the green button to
 
01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
remove this bill from the table thank
 
01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker chair recognizes
 
01:35:27.110 --> 01:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative Carol McGuire for a
 
01:35:30.050 --> 01:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
bill is well intentioned in trying to
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
deal with bad behavior on the part of
 
01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
nursing agencies but is totally useless
 
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the registration it
 
01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
requires is only a hassle it will not
 
01:35:52.610 --> 01:35:52.620 align:start position:0%
prevent any of the abuses that the
 
01:35:55.490 --> 01:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
proponents of this bill are
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
are in favor of they will still have to
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
deal with it
 
01:36:02.209 --> 01:36:02.219 align:start position:0%
if I know that the problem it's trying
 
01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
to solve is dealt with is the national
 
01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
shortage of nurses while we have
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
high demand all over the country
 
01:36:14.090 --> 01:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
and therefore if New Hampshire decides
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
to hassle the nursing agencies they'll
 
01:36:18.649 --> 01:36:18.659 align:start position:0%
simply send their nurses to
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or Maine or Vermont or
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
wherever it they can do it more easily
 
01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
and if I know that despite the massive
 
01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
power of the New Hampshire General Court
 
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
we cannot repeal the law of supply and
 
01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:34.189 align:start position:0%
we cannot repeal the law of supply and
demand

01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
demand
 
01:36:37.370 --> 01:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
what I now vote red to leave this this
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
bill on the table

do you recognize

01:39:03.950 --> 01:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:39:06.169 --> 01:39:06.179 align:start position:0%
first thing I'd like to point out that I
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
am not a nurse
 
01:39:11.450 --> 01:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
but what I am is a member of the county
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
delegation in Stratford County
 
01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
I'm a member of a county delegation as
 
01:39:17.689 --> 01:39:17.699 align:start position:0%
you all are
 
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
one of our responsibilities as a member
 
01:39:21.890 --> 01:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
of the county delegation is oversight of
 
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
our nursing homes
 
01:39:25.610 --> 01:39:25.620 align:start position:0%
and as part of the oversight of our
 
01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
 
01:39:29.450 --> 01:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
all of you have care that our patients
 
01:39:33.110 --> 01:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
get that are in those nursing homes
 
01:39:35.930 --> 01:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
I had an opportunity to speak to my
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
nursing home administrator
 
01:39:40.010 --> 01:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
and I want to tell you that all 10
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
nursing home administrators in the 10
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
counties in New Hampshire support this
 
01:39:43.679 --> 01:39:45.410 align:start position:0%
counties in New Hampshire support this
bill

01:39:45.410 --> 01:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:39:48.110 --> 01:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
so we say it may not be needed but all
 
01:39:49.970 --> 01:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
10 of them support it New Hampshire
 
01:39:52.490 --> 01:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
Association of County sent you a notice
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
the other day saying they support this
 
01:39:57.290 --> 01:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:59.149 --> 01:39:59.159 align:start position:0%
what we have to worry about what a
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
nursing home administrator has to worry
 
01:40:02.209 --> 01:40:02.219 align:start position:0%
about when a nurse is planning to be out
 
01:40:04.850 --> 01:40:04.860 align:start position:0%
sit for maternity or sick an injury or
 
01:40:07.129 --> 01:40:07.139 align:start position:0%
whatever when they're shorted short a
 
01:40:07.139 --> 01:40:08.270 align:start position:0%
whatever when they're shorted short a
staff

01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
staff
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
they have to depend on these nursing
 
01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:12.169 align:start position:0%
they have to depend on these nursing
agencies

01:40:12.169 --> 01:40:12.179 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:40:14.510 --> 01:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
these are they enter into contracts with
 
01:40:16.250 --> 01:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
these nursing agencies to provide
 
01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:18.229 align:start position:0%
these nursing agencies to provide
replacements

01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
replacements
 
01:40:20.689 --> 01:40:20.699 align:start position:0%
so that our patients can receive quality
 
01:40:20.699 --> 01:40:22.010 align:start position:0%
so that our patients can receive quality
Care

01:40:22.010 --> 01:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
Care
 
01:40:24.290 --> 01:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
the residents of our homes
 
01:40:28.370 --> 01:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:31.490 --> 01:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
this bill does three things
 
01:40:33.530 --> 01:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
requires that the medical staffing
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
agencies do business in New Hampshire be
 
01:40:36.649 --> 01:40:36.659 align:start position:0%
registered with the state with the
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
officer professional licenses and
 
01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:40.610 align:start position:0%
officer professional licenses and
certification

01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
certification
 
01:40:42.890 --> 01:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
it prohibits agencies from double
 
01:40:45.370 --> 01:40:45.380 align:start position:0%
booking staff at multiple facilities
 
01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
simultaneously and then engaging in a
 
01:40:50.930 --> 01:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
bidding war between facilities at the
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
11th hour and rewarding the highest
 
01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:54.290 align:start position:0%
11th hour and rewarding the highest
bidder

01:40:54.290 --> 01:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
bidder
 
01:40:57.890 --> 01:40:57.900 align:start position:0%
and prohibits agencies of recruiting on
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
a provider's premises
 
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
sounds a little unethical but
 
01:41:06.350 --> 01:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
when I spoke to particularly the part
 
01:41:09.050 --> 01:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
where it talks about the double booking
 
01:41:12.110 --> 01:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
I talked to my administrator and he said
 
01:41:14.450 --> 01:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
you know when I get a call from an agent
 
01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
we've entered into a contract and I get
 
01:41:17.689 --> 01:41:17.699 align:start position:0%
a call from an agency and they said you
 
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
know that nursing is going to show up
 
01:41:21.229 --> 01:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
this week because we got a better rate
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
from another
 
01:41:25.729 --> 01:41:25.739 align:start position:0%
Another Place Another hospital or
 
01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
another nursing home he says that sounds
 
01:41:30.649 --> 01:41:30.659 align:start position:0%
like extortion they want me to pay more
 
01:41:33.169 --> 01:41:33.179 align:start position:0%
than I agreed to
 
01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
most of our budgets are set by us at the
 
01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
counties and so they don't have the
 
01:41:39.770 --> 01:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
ability to go out and just raise their
 
01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
rates and and charge more money and dip
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
into the budget just get more money
 
01:41:46.010 --> 01:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
they've come back to the delegations if
 
01:41:47.810 --> 01:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
they need more money so this is creating
 
01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
problems for them
 
01:41:52.669 --> 01:41:52.679 align:start position:0%
and you know called it extortion and
 
01:41:56.990 --> 01:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what it is it's extortion
 
01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
and I think when you if you take a look
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
at it from what is our responsibility
 
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
to those folks our mothers our fathers
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
our relatives our parents our
 
01:42:12.410 --> 01:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
grandparents who are in these homes
 
01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
that we have to be concerned about the
 
01:42:16.370 --> 01:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
quality of care
 
01:42:17.570 --> 01:42:17.580 align:start position:0%
and when we're taking a look at the
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
issues that we have with Staffing and
 
01:42:21.649 --> 01:42:21.659 align:start position:0%
retention right now in nursing homes
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
this is an important bill and this is
 
01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
something that is valuable for us and we
 
01:42:28.189 --> 01:42:28.199 align:start position:0%
should we should pass this bill today
 
01:42:30.290 --> 01:42:30.300 align:start position:0%
so if I want to support our nursing home
 
01:42:32.450 --> 01:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
support our nursing support the patients
 
01:42:34.129 --> 01:42:34.139 align:start position:0%
who are in our nursing homes and support
 
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
our administrators who work hard to give
 
01:42:37.970 --> 01:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
the best quality that we can in our
 
01:42:41.330 --> 01:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
dirty homes what I not now vote green
 
01:42:43.129 --> 01:42:43.139 align:start position:0%
and let's get this thing approved thank
 
01:42:43.139 --> 01:42:46.970 align:start position:0%
and let's get this thing approved thank
you

01:42:46.970 --> 01:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:50.340 align:start position:0%
I heard a request for a roll call
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
Senator Cushman requests a roll call is
 
01:42:54.770 --> 01:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
that sufficiently seconded
 
01:42:57.050 --> 01:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
01:44:03.250 --> 01:44:03.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is Senate Bill 149
 
01:44:10.850 --> 01:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended this is a roll
 
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
call vote chair recognizer
 
01:44:14.689 --> 01:44:14.699 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire Carol McGuire for
 
01:44:17.810 --> 01:44:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:21.109 --> 01:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
bill merely requires registration of
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
nurse agencies
 
01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the
 
01:44:31.490 --> 01:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure has
 
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
almost no control and no means to
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
discipline agencies that are
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
do not obey the rules or the laws other
 
01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
than to unregister them
 
01:44:46.689 --> 01:44:46.699 align:start position:0%
and if I know that that will be
 
01:44:49.970 --> 01:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
ineffectual in solving the problems that
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
our nursing homes both County and
 
01:44:56.209 --> 01:44:56.219 align:start position:0%
otherwise are facing and again if I know
 
01:44:58.430 --> 01:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
we can't repeal the law of supply and
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
demand to get more nurses
 
01:45:04.850 --> 01:45:04.860 align:start position:0%
and this bill will do nothing to solve
 
01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
that problem would I press the red
 
01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:09.530 align:start position:0%
that problem would I press the red
button

01:45:09.530 --> 01:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
button
 
01:45:11.090 --> 01:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
do you recognize representative Weber
 
01:45:15.649 --> 01:45:15.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:17.689 --> 01:45:17.699 align:start position:0%
speaker if I know that the flight of
 
01:45:20.810 --> 01:45:20.820 align:start position:0%
agencies and nurses to other states is
 
01:45:23.810 --> 01:45:23.820 align:start position:0%
unlikely because they already have this
 
01:45:27.169 --> 01:45:27.179 align:start position:0%
kind of registration in place
 
01:45:29.709 --> 01:45:29.719 align:start position:0%
and this just levels the playing field
 
01:45:33.609 --> 01:45:33.619 align:start position:0%
and if I want to give an even chance
 
01:45:36.410 --> 01:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
especially to our County nursing homes
 
01:45:40.129 --> 01:45:40.139 align:start position:0%
but to all of our institutions would I
 
01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
now press the green button to pass this
 
01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:44.450 align:start position:0%
now press the green button to pass this
bill

01:45:44.450 --> 01:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
bill

amendment
 
01:48:25.790 --> 01:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
this amendment adds to SB 172 the
 
01:48:29.810 --> 01:48:29.820 align:start position:0%
verbatim text of House Bill 117 as
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
passed by this body on March 9th of this
 
01:48:35.810 --> 01:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
year with a strong bipartisan vote the
 
01:48:39.709 --> 01:48:39.719 align:start position:0%
vote in fact on a roll call was 207 211
 
01:48:42.590 --> 01:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
to 157.
 
01:48:45.229 --> 01:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
please recall that the purpose of of
 
01:48:49.490 --> 01:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
House Bill 117 was to overrule a 2005
 
01:48:52.250 --> 01:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision that essentially
 
01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
makes the term of a lease that is the
 
01:48:58.189 --> 01:48:58.199 align:start position:0%
length of a lease unenforceable if you
 
01:49:00.770 --> 01:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
are a landlord so that for example a
 
01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
one-year lease means it's a one-year
 
01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
lease for the tenant but not for the
 
01:49:09.050 --> 01:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
landlord if at the end of the term the
 
01:49:12.109 --> 01:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
landlord wishes to terminate the lease
 
01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
that does not provide a basis to evict
 
01:49:17.330 --> 01:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
the tenant because according to that
 
01:49:19.790 --> 01:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision the end of the
 
01:49:22.490 --> 01:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
contract is not good cause for an
 
01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:24.169 align:start position:0%
contract is not good cause for an
eviction

01:49:24.169 --> 01:49:24.179 align:start position:0%
eviction
 
01:49:27.290 --> 01:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
bear in mind that the rule as
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
established by that Supreme Court
 
01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
decision applies not just to Big
 
01:49:33.709 --> 01:49:33.719 align:start position:0%
landlords but to small landlords who
 
01:49:37.790 --> 01:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
rent out as few as two rental units if
 
01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
they are not single-family homes and if
 
01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
they are not owner occupied
 
01:49:46.010 --> 01:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
the court decision was criticized by
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
Justice Joseph Neto an appointee of
 
01:49:51.169 --> 01:49:51.179 align:start position:0%
Governor Shaheen in a special
 
01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
concurrence he wrote that the effect of
 
01:49:56.270 --> 01:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court's ruling was to render
 
01:49:58.970 --> 01:49:58.980 align:start position:0%
least terms annullity and to Grant
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
tenants a Perpetual lease where that was
 
01:50:04.129 --> 01:50:04.139 align:start position:0%
where there was no evidence that that
 
01:50:06.649 --> 01:50:06.659 align:start position:0%
was what the legislature intended
 
01:50:10.669 --> 01:50:10.679 align:start position:0%
HB 117 and this amendment corrects the
 
01:50:12.770 --> 01:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
Court's error by saying that the end of
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
a tenancy is a proper basis to evict a
 
01:50:18.350 --> 01:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
tenant but the tenant but the landlord
 
01:50:20.570 --> 01:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
must give 30 days notice and there is an
 
01:50:24.410 --> 01:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
exception for very short-term leases
 
01:50:26.570 --> 01:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
although this house overwhelmed or
 
01:50:28.250 --> 01:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
although this house by a substantial
 
01:50:32.090 --> 01:50:32.100 align:start position:0%
vote passed this bill it was itl in the
 
01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:33.470 align:start position:0%
vote passed this bill it was itl in the
Senate

01:50:33.470 --> 01:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
01:50:36.169 --> 01:50:36.179 align:start position:0%
um it was itl on a Voice vote and
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
although we don't have a record people
 
01:50:40.430 --> 01:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
who were in The Gallery and supported
 
01:50:42.109 --> 01:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
the bill indicate that it appeared
 
01:50:43.910 --> 01:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not contesting that
 
01:50:47.090 --> 01:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
that it was in fact itl but they do
 
01:50:49.790 --> 01:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
indicate that it was a close vote
 
01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:51.169 align:start position:0%
indicate that it was a close vote
um

01:50:51.169 --> 01:50:51.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:53.510 --> 01:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
passage of this amendment
 
01:50:55.850 --> 01:50:55.860 align:start position:0%
will help to make
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
housing available to marginalized people
 
01:51:00.649 --> 01:51:00.659 align:start position:0%
as I said at the time the bill was
 
01:51:02.209 --> 01:51:02.219 align:start position:0%
before the Senate before this body
 
01:51:06.290 --> 01:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
before a landlord is more likely to take
 
01:51:08.570 --> 01:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
a risk on a person who might be a might
 
01:51:10.370 --> 01:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
be sort of a marginalized or a
 
01:51:12.890 --> 01:51:12.900 align:start position:0%
questionable tenant maybe with a spotty
 
01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
credit record or whatever if the
 
01:51:17.229 --> 01:51:17.239 align:start position:0%
landlord knows that if the landlord
 
01:51:19.550 --> 01:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
proposes a one-year lease it really
 
01:51:21.890 --> 01:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
means it's one year not that the
 
01:51:24.169 --> 01:51:24.179 align:start position:0%
landlord is on the hook forever if the
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
landlord under as under current law
 
01:51:28.010 --> 01:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
knows that I may be on the hook forever
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
then it's much less likely that the
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
landlord would be open to considering a
 
01:51:35.629 --> 01:51:35.639 align:start position:0%
marginalized tenant hmm
 
01:51:38.810 --> 01:51:38.820 align:start position:0%
we we in this body agreed with that
 
01:51:41.330 --> 01:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
analysis but the Senate did not
 
01:51:45.169 --> 01:51:45.179 align:start position:0%
by attaching this amendment to sb150 SB
 
01:51:49.490 --> 01:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
172 a non-controversial bill that both
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
Chambers support
 
01:51:53.090 --> 01:51:53.100 align:start position:0%
the other chamber will have to
 
01:51:55.310 --> 01:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
reevaluate its position
 
01:51:58.070 --> 01:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
and likely we'll see the wisdom of The
 
01:52:00.649 --> 01:52:00.659 align:start position:0%
house's efforts to enhance housing
 
01:52:00.659 --> 01:52:02.870 align:start position:0%
house's efforts to enhance housing
availability

01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
availability
 
01:52:06.109 --> 01:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
so if you voted for this bill before
 
01:52:09.590 --> 01:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
I respectfully ask that you do so again
 
01:52:12.050 --> 01:52:12.060 align:start position:0%
now by supporting this amendment
 
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
and if you didn't vote for House Bill
 
01:52:17.570 --> 01:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
117 before I respectfully request that
 
01:52:20.570 --> 01:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
you rethink your position and hopefully
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
change your view
 
01:52:24.770 --> 01:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
the current state of New Hampshire law
 
01:52:27.590 --> 01:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
on this issue I submit respectfully
 
01:52:31.129 --> 01:52:31.139 align:start position:0%
really is an embarrassment and cries out
 
01:52:33.770 --> 01:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
to be fixed thank you Mr Speaker and I
 
01:52:36.770 --> 01:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
ask for a division vote
 
01:52:42.770 --> 01:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:45.050 --> 01:52:45.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:52:48.109 --> 01:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
so I urge my colleagues to vote against
 
01:52:50.090 --> 01:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
this floor Amendment this amendment
 
01:52:52.010 --> 01:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
would essentially make it easier to
 
01:52:54.169 --> 01:52:54.179 align:start position:0%
evict a tenant without any legitimate
 
01:52:54.179 --> 01:52:55.729 align:start position:0%
evict a tenant without any legitimate
reasoning

01:52:55.729 --> 01:52:55.739 align:start position:0%
reasoning
 
01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
um so let's start by just briefly going
 
01:53:00.290 --> 01:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
over the good cause statute currently
 
01:53:02.570 --> 01:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
landlords who lease restricted property
 
01:53:05.810 --> 01:53:05.820 align:start position:0%
must have good cause for eviction this
 
01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
is a fair and balanced law that has been
 
01:53:11.169 --> 01:53:11.179 align:start position:0%
in effect since 1985.
 
01:53:13.970 --> 01:53:13.980 align:start position:0%
good cause offers landlords a number of
 
01:53:16.669 --> 01:53:16.679 align:start position:0%
reasons including business and economic
 
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
reasons to justify a conviction
 
01:53:21.410 --> 01:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
this includes when attendant doesn't
 
01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:23.940 align:start position:0%
increase to a rent increase wanting to
 
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
renovate or take the unit off the market
 
01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
or wanting to run it to a family member
 
01:53:31.370 --> 01:53:31.380 align:start position:0%
also without this amendment landlords
 
01:53:33.530 --> 01:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
can already evict for non-payment of
 
01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:34.490 align:start position:0%
can already evict for non-payment of
rent

01:53:34.490 --> 01:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
rent
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh damaging the property or really any
 
01:53:40.609 --> 01:53:40.619 align:start position:0%
violation of the lease so in short this
 
01:53:42.649 --> 01:53:42.659 align:start position:0%
amendment will not in any way help
 
01:53:45.229 --> 01:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
marginalized people this amendment would
 
01:53:47.570 --> 01:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
significantly weaken the good cause
 
01:53:50.450 --> 01:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
eviction statute when there are a number
 
01:53:52.490 --> 01:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
of legitimate reasons that a landlord
 
01:53:54.890 --> 01:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
can evict a tenant without this
 
01:53:57.530 --> 01:53:57.540 align:start position:0%
amendment as the Supreme Court held in
 
01:54:00.649 --> 01:54:00.659 align:start position:0%
2005 arbitrarily evicting someone at the
 
01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
end of a lease term is not good cause
 
01:54:05.570 --> 01:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
ending this law that has offered
 
01:54:07.310 --> 01:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
protection from arbitrary loss of
 
01:54:10.129 --> 01:54:10.139 align:start position:0%
housing for 40 years during a time when
 
01:54:12.410 --> 01:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
there is a housing crisis will expose

01:54:18.109 --> 01:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
therefore I respectfully ask my
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
colleagues to press the red button and
 
01:54:24.770 --> 01:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:26.810 --> 01:54:26.820 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the floor
 
01:54:30.109 --> 01:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment 2116h a division has been
 
01:54:33.649 --> 01:54:33.659 align:start position:0%

01:55:50.270 --> 01:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the Lin house
 
01:55:57.470 --> 01:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:01.010 --> 01:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
is the Lynn floor Amendment 2116 this is
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
a division vote share recognized
 
01:56:04.729 --> 01:56:04.739 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn for a parliamentary
 
01:56:04.739 --> 01:56:08.149 align:start position:0%

01:56:08.149 --> 01:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:10.609 --> 01:56:10.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
01:56:12.590 --> 01:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
know that this amendment restores the
 
01:56:14.689 --> 01:56:14.699 align:start position:0%
fundamental principle of law that
 
01:56:16.669 --> 01:56:16.679 align:start position:0%
contact contracts are supposed to mean
 
01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
what they say and if I also know that
 
01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
passing this amendment
 
01:56:24.050 --> 01:56:24.060 align:start position:0%
will help to improve the availability of
 
01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
rental housing to marginalized
 
01:56:28.370 --> 01:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
individuals by giving landlords reason
 
01:56:30.410 --> 01:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
to take a chance on renting to such
 
01:56:32.930 --> 01:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
persons and finally if I know that
 
01:56:36.410 --> 01:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
adding this amendment to SB 172 a
 
01:56:38.570 --> 01:56:38.580 align:start position:0%
non-controversial bill that will pass
 
01:56:41.090 --> 01:56:41.100 align:start position:0%
this chamber whether or not uh this
 
01:56:44.090 --> 01:56:44.100 align:start position:0%
amendment is adopted but passing this
 
01:56:45.890 --> 01:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
amendment will likely cause the other
 
01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
chamber behind the wall to rethink its
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
erroneous position on this issue than
 
01:56:53.870 --> 01:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
would I support the passage of this
 
01:56:55.790 --> 01:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
amendment by passing by pushing the
 
01:56:58.189 --> 01:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
green button thank you Mr Speaker chair
 
01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:00.480 align:start position:0%

01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
01:57:05.330 --> 01:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker as
 
01:57:08.750 --> 01:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
someone who voted incorrectly when this
 
01:57:10.609 --> 01:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
bill came up the first time and has
 
01:57:13.729 --> 01:57:13.739 align:start position:0%
learned the error of his ways and Mr
 
01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that current New
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law provides that landlords do
 
01:57:21.290 --> 01:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
not have to put up with and can evict
 
01:57:23.810 --> 01:57:23.820 align:start position:0%
tenants who don't pay their rent destroy
 
01:57:25.729 --> 01:57:25.739 align:start position:0%
property who have pets when they are not
 
01:57:28.010 --> 01:57:28.020 align:start position:0%
supposed to or who are disruptive to
 
01:57:30.530 --> 01:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
other tenants and Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:57:31.970 --> 01:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire law gives the
 
01:57:33.709 --> 01:57:33.719 align:start position:0%
landlord the right to require a rental
 
01:57:35.870 --> 01:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
application from the prospective tenants
 
01:57:37.970 --> 01:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
allows landlords to charge an
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
application fee for the time and effort
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
they take to review the application and
 
01:57:44.450 --> 01:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
calls tenants pass landlords or personal
 
01:57:46.609 --> 01:57:46.619 align:start position:0%
recommendations now without this
 
01:57:46.619 --> 01:57:47.629 align:start position:0%
recommendations now without this
amendment

01:57:47.629 --> 01:57:47.639 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
and if I know that landlords that live
 
01:57:51.530 --> 01:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
in buildings where they rent or
 
01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
landlords that rent commercials seasonal
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
recreational or single-family homes can
 
01:57:57.950 --> 01:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
initiate the eviction process or
 
01:58:00.290 --> 01:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
cancellation of a lease at any time
 
01:58:02.570 --> 01:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
without good cause without this
 
01:58:05.330 --> 01:58:05.340 align:start position:0%

if you'd asked me a month ago if I would
 
03:44:44.090 --> 03:44:44.100 align:start position:0%
ever have had to speak on House Bill 2 I
 
03:44:45.769 --> 03:44:45.779 align:start position:0%
would have said no I don't want to be
 
03:44:45.779 --> 03:44:47.510 align:start position:0%
would have said no I don't want to be
here

03:44:47.510 --> 03:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:44:52.490 --> 03:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:56.269 --> 03:44:56.279 align:start position:0%
I have to be here for two reasons one
 
03:44:57.889 --> 03:44:57.899 align:start position:0%
for the record Representative Steve
 
03:45:00.349 --> 03:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
Pearson Rockingham District 13 Derry
 
03:45:05.870 --> 03:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:07.550 --> 03:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
remember of a lot of things
 
03:45:07.560 --> 03:45:10.250 align:start position:0%
remember of a lot of things
really

03:45:10.250 --> 03:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:45:12.229 --> 03:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
the first reason I rise in opposition to
 
03:45:14.510 --> 03:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
this is because I have to in the effect
 
03:45:14.520 --> 03:45:16.070 align:start position:0%
this is because I have to in the effect
of

03:45:16.070 --> 03:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:45:19.130 --> 03:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
the educational formula my school
 
03:45:20.450 --> 03:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
district is the third largest school
 
03:45:22.969 --> 03:45:22.979 align:start position:0%
district in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:45:25.550 --> 03:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
the numbers that are there I I can't
 
03:45:28.729 --> 03:45:28.739 align:start position:0%
even fathom why Dairy was
 
03:45:32.090 --> 03:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
grossly neglected
 
03:45:36.950 --> 03:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:40.190 --> 03:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
the second reason I Rise
 
03:45:42.530 --> 03:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
in opposition to House Bill 2 is in
 
03:45:44.269 --> 03:45:44.279 align:start position:0%
reference to a substantial effort made
 
03:45:46.130 --> 03:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
by this body
 
03:45:49.670 --> 03:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
this year to right or wrong
 
03:45:51.530 --> 03:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
and I want to just address some grossly
 
03:45:52.790 --> 03:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
inaccurate statements that have been
 
03:45:55.130 --> 03:45:55.140 align:start position:0%
made lately
 
03:45:56.630 --> 03:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
I think this is important to set the
 
03:46:00.830 --> 03:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:03.530 --> 03:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
the pension restoration part
 
03:46:07.550 --> 03:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
that we voted on 282 to 80.
 
03:46:12.170 --> 03:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:14.389 --> 03:46:14.399 align:start position:0%
has been referred to as a sweetener bill
 
03:46:17.450 --> 03:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
by the executive branch
 
03:46:20.150 --> 03:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
that's far from reality
 
03:46:22.969 --> 03:46:22.979 align:start position:0%
it restored some of the items just some
 
03:46:24.889 --> 03:46:24.899 align:start position:0%
that were retroactively taken away from
 
03:46:27.349 --> 03:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
our First Responders it provided no new
 
03:46:29.510 --> 03:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
benefit of any kind
 
03:46:31.309 --> 03:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
returning something that was stolen from
 
03:46:35.690 --> 03:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:37.130 --> 03:46:37.140 align:start position:0%
then we had to deal with a lobbying
 
03:46:38.570 --> 03:46:38.580 align:start position:0%
group that created a false fiscal
 
03:46:38.580 --> 03:46:40.550 align:start position:0%
group that created a false fiscal
analysis

03:46:40.550 --> 03:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
03:46:43.130 --> 03:46:43.140 align:start position:0%
pension related items are processed by
 
03:46:44.809 --> 03:46:44.819 align:start position:0%
the retirement system that is their
 
03:46:44.819 --> 03:46:47.090 align:start position:0%
the retirement system that is their
function

03:46:47.090 --> 03:46:47.100 align:start position:0%
function
 
03:46:48.650 --> 03:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
and the costs associated with
 
03:46:50.929 --> 03:46:50.939 align:start position:0%
legislation are processed by a
 
03:46:53.630 --> 03:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
consulting firm an Actuarial firm that
 
03:46:56.690 --> 03:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
the state has used for 20 years
 
03:46:58.550 --> 03:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
this lobbying group
 
03:47:00.590 --> 03:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
decided to create their own
 
03:47:02.990 --> 03:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
they included irrelevant items
 
03:47:05.030 --> 03:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
in their analysis
 
03:47:07.010 --> 03:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
they included items that occurred in
 
03:47:09.889 --> 03:47:09.899 align:start position:0%
past legislative sessions I've never
 
03:47:11.210 --> 03:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
seen I've been here three terms I've
 
03:47:15.110 --> 03:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:17.570 --> 03:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
and even they included items that were
 
03:47:20.510 --> 03:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
already bought and paid for
 
03:47:21.889 --> 03:47:21.899 align:start position:0%
and then they claimed it was the true
 
03:47:24.710 --> 03:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
analysis and at one point there were
 
03:47:28.550 --> 03:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
folks getting this analysis attached to
 
03:47:30.769 --> 03:47:30.779 align:start position:0%
the one from the retirement system it
 
03:47:31.910 --> 03:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
kind of made it look like it went
 
03:47:31.920 --> 03:47:34.729 align:start position:0%
kind of made it look like it went
together

03:47:34.729 --> 03:47:34.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:36.530 --> 03:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
this lobbying group doesn't have an
 
03:47:40.490 --> 03:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:41.990 --> 03:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
they're not qualified to do this
 
03:47:42.000 --> 03:47:43.429 align:start position:0%
they're not qualified to do this
analysis

03:47:43.429 --> 03:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
03:47:45.590 --> 03:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
and yet that's what they presented to
 
03:47:50.210 --> 03:47:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:52.250 --> 03:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
thirdly there have been repeated
 
03:47:54.349 --> 03:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
inaccurate statements
 
03:47:57.229 --> 03:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
that this bill reintroduces spiking
 
03:47:59.990 --> 03:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
back into the pension system
 
03:48:01.969 --> 03:48:01.979 align:start position:0%
spiking is when an employee has the
 
03:48:03.650 --> 03:48:03.660 align:start position:0%
ability to manipulate their work
 
03:48:06.590 --> 03:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
schedules and conditions
 
03:48:08.330 --> 03:48:08.340 align:start position:0%
to overly inflate their pension
 
03:48:10.490 --> 03:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
something I abhor
 
03:48:14.030 --> 03:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
in all of the folks in this room that
 
03:48:15.530 --> 03:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
deal with the pension system have no
 
03:48:19.070 --> 03:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:20.990 --> 03:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
of the anti-spiking provisions that were
 
03:48:25.490 --> 03:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
enacted from 2007 to 2011 remain in law
 
03:48:29.750 --> 03:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
in fact the anti-spiking provisions were
 
03:48:29.760 --> 03:48:31.610 align:start position:0%
in fact the anti-spiking provisions were
expanded

03:48:31.610 --> 03:48:31.620 align:start position:0%
expanded
 
03:48:33.410 --> 03:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
they were expanded
 
03:48:35.870 --> 03:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
by extending the pension cap back from
 
03:48:39.469 --> 03:48:39.479 align:start position:0%
2009 to 2001. a hard pension cap is the
 
03:48:39.479 --> 03:48:41.050 align:start position:0%
2009 to 2001. a hard pension cap is the
ultimate

03:48:41.050 --> 03:48:41.060 align:start position:0%
ultimate
 
03:48:43.849 --> 03:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
anti-spiking provision
 
03:48:47.269 --> 03:48:47.279 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders agreed for the first
 
03:48:48.769 --> 03:48:48.779 align:start position:0%
time in a decade
 
03:48:50.510 --> 03:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
they agreed with each other that was a
 
03:48:52.490 --> 03:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
Monumental task in and of itself but
 
03:48:54.889 --> 03:48:54.899 align:start position:0%
they agreed to dozens of concessions
 
03:48:57.830 --> 03:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
finance division one unanimously voted
 
03:49:00.290 --> 03:49:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:01.910 --> 03:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
when this bill
 
03:49:05.210 --> 03:49:05.220 align:start position:0%
House Bill 436 came before this body
 
03:49:07.849 --> 03:49:07.859 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note on it was 258 million
 
03:49:10.250 --> 03:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
dollars to be paid over 10 years
 
03:49:12.650 --> 03:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
through substantial work we got that
 
03:49:15.469 --> 03:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
cost down to a hundred
 
03:49:17.690 --> 03:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
we voted
 
03:49:22.130 --> 03:49:22.140 align:start position:0%
in a veto proof majority at 258 million
 
03:49:23.929 --> 03:49:23.939 align:start position:0%
we found that acceptable in this body
 
03:49:27.349 --> 03:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
since then we've dropped it to a hundred
 
03:49:31.490 --> 03:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
with a reduction in pension debt on top
 
03:49:33.469 --> 03:49:33.479 align:start position:0%
of funding this
 
03:49:35.150 --> 03:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
thanks to the efforts of Representative
 
03:49:38.030 --> 03:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
Joe Sweeney we found dedicated funding
 
03:49:39.590 --> 03:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
source for this
 
03:49:42.349 --> 03:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
to pay for this without having to use
 
03:49:45.950 --> 03:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
any general fund appropriation
 
03:49:51.650 --> 03:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:55.309 --> 03:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
this body in the in 2011
 
03:49:57.469 --> 03:49:57.479 align:start position:0%
did something that no other state had
 
03:49:57.479 --> 03:49:58.429 align:start position:0%
did something that no other state had
done

03:49:58.429 --> 03:49:58.439 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:50:01.429 --> 03:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
it retroactively modified our pension
 
03:50:01.439 --> 03:50:03.170 align:start position:0%
it retroactively modified our pension
system

03:50:03.170 --> 03:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:50:07.309 --> 03:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
for our First Responders despite article
 
03:50:11.269 --> 03:50:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:13.130 --> 03:50:13.140 align:start position:0%
every single state dealt with pension

03:50:33.290 --> 03:50:33.300 align:start position:0%
this leaves New Hampshire alone
 
03:50:36.769 --> 03:50:36.779 align:start position:0%
still in this
 
03:50:39.469 --> 03:50:39.479 align:start position:0%
we continue to stick our heads in the

03:51:03.950 --> 03:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
prior to 2011 New Hampshire was
 
03:51:05.929 --> 03:51:05.939 align:start position:0%
competitive in the New England Regional
 
03:51:07.309 --> 03:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
labor market
 
03:51:11.929 --> 03:51:11.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:13.729 --> 03:51:13.739 align:start position:0%
why did this happen
 
03:51:16.610 --> 03:51:16.620 align:start position:0%
what was the real reason
 
03:51:18.830 --> 03:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
it is claimed it was to make up a 900
 
03:51:21.050 --> 03:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
million dollar budget shortfall
 
03:51:21.060 --> 03:51:22.250 align:start position:0%
million dollar budget shortfall
okay

03:51:22.250 --> 03:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:51:25.670 --> 03:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
if that's true then in an era of three
 
03:51:27.469 --> 03:51:27.479 align:start position:0%
budget Cycles
 
03:51:30.410 --> 03:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
with substantial surpluses
 
03:51:33.590 --> 03:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
why could we not restore that which was
 
03:51:33.600 --> 03:51:36.110 align:start position:0%
why could we not restore that which was
cut

03:51:36.110 --> 03:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:39.050 --> 03:51:39.060 align:start position:0%
or maybe that wasn't the reason at all
 
03:51:46.490 --> 03:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:49.370 --> 03:51:49.380 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker I have a different
 
03:56:03.790 --> 03:56:03.800 align:start position:0%
perspective on the pension aspects
 
03:56:06.710 --> 03:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
that are not currently in-house Bill too
 
03:56:09.469 --> 03:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
but were in-house Bill too when it left
 
03:56:10.570 --> 03:56:10.580 align:start position:0%
this body
 
03:56:13.309 --> 03:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
months ago
 
03:56:13.319 --> 03:56:14.809 align:start position:0%
months ago
um

03:56:14.809 --> 03:56:14.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:16.429 --> 03:56:16.439 align:start position:0%
first of all let's start with a little
 
03:56:19.790 --> 03:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
bit of History a year ago
 
03:56:24.349 --> 03:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
um we passed a bill that improved the
 
03:56:27.170 --> 03:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
pensions of the group in question the
 
03:56:30.110 --> 03:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
group of group two firefighters hired
 
03:56:32.389 --> 03:56:32.399 align:start position:0%
from one date to another but roughly a
 
03:56:34.990 --> 03:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
10 or so year period
 
03:56:38.269 --> 03:56:38.279 align:start position:0%
and the cost of that bill was a little
 
03:56:40.429 --> 03:56:40.439 align:start position:0%
over 40 million dollars
 
03:56:42.830 --> 03:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
the bill is originally this was House
 
03:56:42.840 --> 03:56:43.689 align:start position:0%
the bill is originally this was House
Bill

03:56:43.689 --> 03:56:43.699 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:56:48.590 --> 03:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
1578 I think from a year ago and and the
 
03:56:51.469 --> 03:56:51.479 align:start position:0%
bill was originally maybe 56 million
 
03:56:54.110 --> 03:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
dollars it came to the house finance
 
03:56:56.750 --> 03:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
committee it was reduced to 40 42
 
03:56:59.210 --> 03:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
million dollars it went over to the
 
03:57:02.150 --> 03:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
other side passed unanimously signed
 
03:57:05.210 --> 03:57:05.220 align:start position:0%
into law by the governor so already in
 
03:57:06.950 --> 03:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
the current biennium the biennium we're
 
03:57:09.889 --> 03:57:09.899 align:start position:0%
in right now we have improved pensions
 
03:57:12.950 --> 03:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
for this exact same group of people by
 
03:57:16.250 --> 03:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
40 something million dollars
 
03:57:19.429 --> 03:57:19.439 align:start position:0%
this year a bill was proposed House Bill
 
03:57:19.439 --> 03:57:21.290 align:start position:0%
this year a bill was proposed House Bill
436

03:57:21.290 --> 03:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
436
 
03:57:25.550 --> 03:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
which was a significant additional
 
03:57:25.560 --> 03:57:27.410 align:start position:0%
which was a significant additional
Improvement

03:57:27.410 --> 03:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
Improvement
 
03:57:32.570 --> 03:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
and and restoration that that's correct
 
03:57:35.389 --> 03:57:35.399 align:start position:0%
um for that same group
 
03:57:35.399 --> 03:57:37.010 align:start position:0%
um for that same group
and

03:57:37.010 --> 03:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:57:39.050 --> 03:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
um it would have been you know the
 
03:57:41.570 --> 03:57:41.580 align:start position:0%
original fiscal note was roughly 250
 
03:57:44.450 --> 03:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
million dollars spread out over 10 years
 
03:57:48.110 --> 03:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
25 million dollars a year for 10 years
 
03:57:50.689 --> 03:57:50.699 align:start position:0%
now I would disagree with my friend from
 
03:57:54.950 --> 03:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
Derry on the on the aspect of spiking
 
03:57:59.110 --> 03:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
because this that bill House Bill 436
 
03:58:03.050 --> 03:58:03.060 align:start position:0%
changed the definitions of income and
 
03:58:04.849 --> 03:58:04.859 align:start position:0%
the definitions of average final
 
03:58:04.859 --> 03:58:06.650 align:start position:0%
the definitions of average final
compensation

03:58:06.650 --> 03:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
03:58:10.309 --> 03:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
as well as some other features the the
 
03:58:12.889 --> 03:58:12.899 align:start position:0%
multiplier and the age at which
 
03:58:15.170 --> 03:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
retirement could be someone could retire
 
03:58:16.309 --> 03:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
and so on
 
03:58:19.429 --> 03:58:19.439 align:start position:0%
but this in specific the definitions of
 
03:58:22.969 --> 03:58:22.979 align:start position:0%
what is income that is where spiking
 
03:58:26.150 --> 03:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
occurs so for example if someone is
 
03:58:30.590 --> 03:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to take sick days as a large
 
03:58:33.650 --> 03:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
lump sum at the end just before
 
03:58:33.660 --> 03:58:35.330 align:start position:0%
lump sum at the end just before
retirement

03:58:35.330 --> 03:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
03:58:38.389 --> 03:58:38.399 align:start position:0%
then that and have that count as though
 
03:58:42.050 --> 03:58:42.060 align:start position:0%
they had a large salary that last year
 
03:58:45.290 --> 03:58:45.300 align:start position:0%
that significantly affects retirement
 
03:58:47.750 --> 03:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
and the the definitions that is
 
03:58:50.630 --> 03:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
currently in place for that group and in
 
03:58:53.570 --> 03:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
fact it's in place for every employee
 
03:58:56.510 --> 03:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
not just group two but it's in place for
 
03:58:58.790 --> 03:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
group ones as well
 
03:59:02.269 --> 03:59:02.279 align:start position:0%
does not allow that kind of spiking all
 
03:59:06.410 --> 03:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
right this bill House Bill 436 changed
 
03:59:08.870 --> 03:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
those definitions back to the previous
 
03:59:11.410 --> 03:59:11.420 align:start position:0%
set of definitions that were in place
 
03:59:14.689 --> 03:59:14.699 align:start position:0%
when this particular group was hired but
 
03:59:16.490 --> 03:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
not yet vested
 
03:59:18.530 --> 03:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:59:18.540 --> 03:59:19.429 align:start position:0%
and so
um

03:59:19.429 --> 03:59:19.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:21.710 --> 03:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
during when the bill came to our
 
03:59:24.550 --> 03:59:24.560 align:start position:0%
committee to the finance division one
 
03:59:27.050 --> 03:59:27.060 align:start position:0%
I suggested
 
03:59:29.090 --> 03:59:29.100 align:start position:0%
why don't we take out those definition
 
03:59:29.100 --> 03:59:30.889 align:start position:0%
why don't we take out those definition
changes

03:59:30.889 --> 03:59:30.899 align:start position:0%
changes
 
03:59:33.650 --> 03:59:33.660 align:start position:0%
and and and consider just the other
 
03:59:36.290 --> 03:59:36.300 align:start position:0%
changes the the multiplier the age and
 
03:59:40.189 --> 03:59:40.199 align:start position:0%
so on all right separately okay because
 
03:59:42.590 --> 03:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
the definition changes is something that
 
03:59:45.530 --> 03:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
applies to everyone group one you know
 
03:59:47.570 --> 03:59:47.580 align:start position:0%
we're talking about teachers state
 
03:59:50.450 --> 03:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
employees everybody all right it was not
 
03:59:53.689 --> 03:59:53.699 align:start position:0%
something done special for group two all
 
03:59:55.429 --> 03:59:55.439 align:start position:0%
right the other parts were but this part
 
03:59:56.630 --> 03:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
was not
 
04:00:00.170 --> 04:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
and I'm told by the retirement system
 
04:00:03.349 --> 04:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
that doing that alone just leaving the
 
04:00:06.349 --> 04:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
definitions the way they are
 
04:00:09.590 --> 04:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
changes the 250 million to something
 
04:00:12.290 --> 04:00:12.300 align:start position:0%
more like 75 million
 
04:00:16.010 --> 04:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
okay so so this to what I think of as
 
04:00:19.130 --> 04:00:19.140 align:start position:0%
the spiking aspects are a significant
 
04:00:21.290 --> 04:00:21.300 align:start position:0%
part of this bill
 
04:00:24.290 --> 04:00:24.300 align:start position:0%
okay now let's talk about what happened
 
04:00:27.110 --> 04:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
to the bill once it left us all right
 
04:00:30.830 --> 04:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
I've had extensive discussions with the
 
04:00:33.469 --> 04:00:33.479 align:start position:0%
chair of the other finance committee
 
04:00:36.229 --> 04:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
he's someone I know quite well because
 
04:00:38.510 --> 04:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
we sat next to each other in division
 
04:00:41.110 --> 04:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
four for two years
 
04:00:45.349 --> 04:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
and the the problem is as we sent it the
 
04:00:47.990 --> 04:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
250 million dollars
 
04:00:51.349 --> 04:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
it was simply sticker shock right they
 
04:00:53.570 --> 04:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
passed the 40 million dollars a year
 
04:00:57.309 --> 04:00:57.319 align:start position:0%
earlier no problem at all 24 to nothing
 
04:01:00.830 --> 04:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
you know everybody liked it right but
 
04:01:04.910 --> 04:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
but jumping on you know trying to ask it
 
04:01:06.950 --> 04:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
was too big of an ask
 
04:01:09.170 --> 04:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
and the problem and so you might say
 
04:01:10.849 --> 04:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
well why didn't they cut it down to
 
04:01:12.290 --> 04:01:12.300 align:start position:0%
something and then we could have
 
04:01:13.969 --> 04:01:13.979 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference and we could we
 
04:01:17.750 --> 04:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
could negotiate the the problem is you
 
04:01:20.630 --> 04:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
in order to negotiate maybe if you're
 
04:01:22.849 --> 04:01:22.859 align:start position:0%
trying to sell your car for 25
 
04:01:25.550 --> 04:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
000 and the buyer wants to pay 20 000.
 
04:01:28.370 --> 04:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
you can negotiate all right
 
04:01:32.150 --> 04:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
but when one side wants 250 million and
 
04:01:34.130 --> 04:01:34.140 align:start position:0%
the other side might be willing to do 50
 
04:01:37.189 --> 04:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
million or something there's no
 
04:01:39.769 --> 04:01:39.779 align:start position:0%
negotiation position right you you
 
04:01:43.309 --> 04:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
you're too far apart all right and so
 
04:01:45.650 --> 04:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
what they what they did in the budget
 
04:01:47.990 --> 04:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
that we're voting on right now
 
04:01:51.370 --> 04:01:51.380 align:start position:0%
is they took this out and unfortunately
 
04:01:54.170 --> 04:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
I'm very disappointed they also took out
 
04:01:57.349 --> 04:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
house bill 50 which was the pay down of
 
04:02:00.349 --> 04:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
the pension system uh pension unfunded
 
04:02:03.110 --> 04:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
liability that we all voted for or many
 
04:02:06.229 --> 04:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
of us did and um that kind of got lost
 
04:02:08.469 --> 04:02:08.479 align:start position:0%
in the in the shuffle
 
04:02:12.410 --> 04:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
and um and they put in a commission a
 
04:02:13.910 --> 04:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
very you know high level sort of
 
04:02:17.030 --> 04:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
commission to think about
 
04:02:20.269 --> 04:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
improving the pension system for
 
04:02:20.279 --> 04:02:21.410 align:start position:0%
improving the pension system for
everyone

04:02:21.410 --> 04:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
04:02:25.670 --> 04:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
not just this particular group of group
 
04:02:28.729 --> 04:02:28.739 align:start position:0%
two employees you know hired from one
 
04:02:31.429 --> 04:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
year to to another but all group two
 
04:02:34.189 --> 04:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
employees because this particular group
 
04:02:38.630 --> 04:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
already has a pension better than the
 
04:02:40.670 --> 04:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
ones that are younger than them
 
04:02:42.590 --> 04:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
so they already have a pension that's
 
04:02:45.530 --> 04:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
that's superior to the ones that we're
 
04:02:47.210 --> 04:02:47.220 align:start position:0%
hiring today
 
04:02:51.110 --> 04:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
and so if our concern is hiring and
 
04:02:53.630 --> 04:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
retention maybe we ought to think about
 
04:02:56.030 --> 04:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
the younger ones as well
 
04:02:58.309 --> 04:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
right and that's what this commission is
 
04:02:58.319 --> 04:02:59.269 align:start position:0%
right and that's what this commission is
for

04:02:59.269 --> 04:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:03:02.809 --> 04:03:02.819 align:start position:0%
so I think they're serious about doing
 
04:03:02.819 --> 04:03:04.130 align:start position:0%
so I think they're serious about doing
something

04:03:04.130 --> 04:03:04.140 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:03:08.510 --> 04:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
but but they it was too big of an ask
 
04:03:12.410 --> 04:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
you know the we asked for the stars and
 
04:03:13.610 --> 04:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
they might have been willing to give us
 
04:03:15.469 --> 04:03:15.479 align:start position:0%
a piece of the moon or something like
 
04:03:17.870 --> 04:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
that you know so it was too big of an
 
04:03:20.269 --> 04:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
ask and this is their way of saying to
 
04:03:25.429 --> 04:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
us sorry we need more time we we need a
 
04:03:27.710 --> 04:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
different structure you know it's not
 
04:03:29.750 --> 04:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
going to work this way and not only by
 
04:03:31.550 --> 04:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
the way did they take out the pension
 
04:03:31.560 --> 04:03:32.510 align:start position:0%
the way did they take out the pension
staff

04:03:32.510 --> 04:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
staff
 
04:03:35.150 --> 04:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
but they took the state's wallet
 
04:03:38.750 --> 04:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
and locked it away they left all of our
 
04:03:41.990 --> 04:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
spare change in the education trust fund
 
04:03:44.590 --> 04:03:44.600 align:start position:0%
so where it can't be used
 
04:03:47.990 --> 04:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
for this kind of thing so so they really
 
04:03:51.410 --> 04:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
are sending us a serious message that
 
04:03:53.809 --> 04:03:53.819 align:start position:0%
they don't want
 
04:03:57.410 --> 04:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
what we tried to do okay but I I think
 
04:04:00.229 --> 04:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
it is not over right and one thing I've
 
04:04:03.530 --> 04:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
learned being here a few terms nothing
 
04:04:06.889 --> 04:04:06.899 align:start position:0%
is ever over right we're always talking
 
04:04:10.250 --> 04:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
we're always working and so not only do
 
04:04:12.349 --> 04:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
we have the commission but we still own
 
04:04:14.689 --> 04:04:14.699 align:start position:0%
house bill 436.
 
04:04:17.570 --> 04:04:17.580 align:start position:0%
so we have retained it it'll come out
 
04:04:20.269 --> 04:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
and so on and I don't think you know
 
04:04:23.330 --> 04:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
it's not like the other body is somehow
 
04:04:26.389 --> 04:04:26.399 align:start position:0%
opposed to group two employees
 
04:04:28.790 --> 04:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
right I mean that's that's just silly
 
04:04:31.490 --> 04:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
but we asked for too much that's that's
 
04:04:36.170 --> 04:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:46.910 --> 04:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:49.429 --> 04:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:04:51.590 --> 04:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
this bill includes several sections that
 
04:04:53.210 --> 04:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
together drastically expand the mission
 
04:04:54.650 --> 04:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
and potentially number of police
 
04:04:56.269 --> 04:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
officers in New Hampshire
 
04:04:58.070 --> 04:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
we've already debated these sections
 
04:05:00.229 --> 04:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
back in April and this house voted
 
04:05:03.229 --> 04:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly to remove them
 
04:05:05.090 --> 04:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
this would be enough for me to ask you
 
04:05:06.710 --> 04:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
to press the red button on this motion
 
04:05:06.720 --> 04:05:07.670 align:start position:0%
to press the red button on this motion
and

04:05:07.670 --> 04:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:05:09.710 --> 04:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
the motion to accept the changes made by
 
04:05:11.150 --> 04:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
the other the body on the other side of
 
04:05:12.530 --> 04:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
the wall
 
04:05:13.910 --> 04:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
however there's also the fact that this
 
04:05:15.530 --> 04:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
bill was passed in the other body less
 
04:05:17.870 --> 04:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
than 24 hours ago with several
 
04:05:19.849 --> 04:05:19.859 align:start position:0%
substantive floor amendments
 
04:05:21.889 --> 04:05:21.899 align:start position:0%
I haven't had the chance to fully study
 
04:05:24.710 --> 04:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
it have you
 
04:05:26.330 --> 04:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
we've all heard the quote you need to
 
04:05:28.309 --> 04:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
pass the bill to find out what's in it
 
04:05:30.170 --> 04:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
that's not the New Hampshire way we're
 
04:05:31.729 --> 04:05:31.739 align:start position:0%
not up against a house deadline for this
 
04:05:34.790 --> 04:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
motion it's being rushed unnecessarily
 
04:05:36.769 --> 04:05:36.779 align:start position:0%
please press the red button to say no to
 
04:05:38.570 --> 04:05:38.580 align:start position:0%
this dangerous Fast Track so another
 
04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
motion can be made to send this bill to
 
04:05:42.710 --> 04:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
a committee conference in other words
 
04:05:45.290 --> 04:05:45.300 align:start position:0%
the normal process for a budget bill
 
04:05:48.290 --> 04:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:57.769 --> 04:05:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:01.010 --> 04:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:06:04.189 --> 04:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
I rise today to urge the members of the
 
04:06:06.530 --> 04:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
house to vote to concur with House Bill
 
04:06:08.990 --> 04:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
2 as amended by the Senate
 
04:06:11.750 --> 04:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
the house sent the Senate a budget that
 
04:06:14.269 --> 04:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
house Democrats and Republicans came
 
04:06:15.769 --> 04:06:15.779 align:start position:0%
together on
 
04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
remember that historic vote when we
 
04:06:22.189 --> 04:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
passed the house Budget on a Voice vote
 
04:06:24.349 --> 04:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
by working together we were able to
 
04:06:26.750 --> 04:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
provide a desperately needed rate
 
04:06:29.689 --> 04:06:29.699 align:start position:0%
increase for our Medicaid providers
 
04:06:31.969 --> 04:06:31.979 align:start position:0%
and the Senate recognized the importance
 
04:06:34.370 --> 04:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
of our work and included the house level
 
04:06:37.309 --> 04:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
of funding in their budget
 
04:06:39.950 --> 04:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
the important pay raise for our valuable
 
04:06:43.070 --> 04:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
state employees remains unchanged from
 
04:06:44.929 --> 04:06:44.939 align:start position:0%
the house budget
 
04:06:47.389 --> 04:06:47.399 align:start position:0%
in areas of housing
 
04:06:49.550 --> 04:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
the Senate added an additional five
 
04:06:52.130 --> 04:06:52.140 align:start position:0%
million dollars to the house budget and
 
04:06:54.530 --> 04:06:54.540 align:start position:0%
by a rearranging the Appropriations they
 
04:06:56.929 --> 04:06:56.939 align:start position:0%
applied 10 million dollars for homeless
 
04:07:01.370 --> 04:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
support for our cities and towns
 
04:07:04.130 --> 04:07:04.140 align:start position:0%
education funding formula is similar to
 
04:07:06.650 --> 04:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
the house formula spending slightly more
 
04:07:09.229 --> 04:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
than the house but both planned to
 
04:07:11.330 --> 04:07:11.340 align:start position:0%
increase school funding to our
 
04:07:13.969 --> 04:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
communities over the current level of
 
04:07:13.979 --> 04:07:15.170 align:start position:0%
communities over the current level of
funding

04:07:15.170 --> 04:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:07:17.630 --> 04:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
Senate budget includes 20 million
 
04:07:20.330 --> 04:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
additional dollars for municipal Bridges
 
04:07:22.910 --> 04:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
and apportionment funds that our
 
04:07:24.710 --> 04:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
communities need
 
04:07:26.990 --> 04:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
to keep our bridges safe
 
04:07:29.030 --> 04:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
and two million dollars was added to
 
04:07:32.210 --> 04:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
bolster our Vital pfast remediation
 
04:07:32.220 --> 04:07:34.250 align:start position:0%
bolster our Vital pfast remediation
program

04:07:34.250 --> 04:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:07:36.950 --> 04:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:36.960 --> 04:07:38.150 align:start position:0%
 
work

04:07:38.150 --> 04:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:07:41.389 --> 04:07:41.399 align:start position:0%
that the house had done by adding needed
 
04:07:45.050 --> 04:07:45.060 align:start position:0%
funding in several areas child care
 
04:07:49.309 --> 04:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
Family Resource Centers ctes and mental
 
04:07:49.319 --> 04:07:50.030 align:start position:0%
Family Resource Centers ctes and mental
health

04:07:50.030 --> 04:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
health
 
04:07:53.210 --> 04:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
just to name a few the Senate was able
 
04:07:54.490 --> 04:07:54.500 align:start position:0%
to use
 
04:07:58.070 --> 04:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
2023 surplus funds to provide much of
 
04:08:00.110 --> 04:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
the additional funding for these vital
 
04:08:00.120 --> 04:08:01.370 align:start position:0%
the additional funding for these vital
services

04:08:01.370 --> 04:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:08:03.469 --> 04:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
but still they were able to deposit
 
04:08:06.290 --> 04:08:06.300 align:start position:0%
close to 63 million in the rainy day
 
04:08:08.809 --> 04:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
fund at the end of the biennium
 
04:08:10.910 --> 04:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
like all budgets
 
04:08:14.750 --> 04:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
we do not get everything we want
 
04:08:17.150 --> 04:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
but this budget goes a long way to
 
04:08:18.410 --> 04:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
meeting the needs of New Hampshire
 
04:08:20.990 --> 04:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
citizens and communities
 
04:08:23.630 --> 04:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
we can all name something we wish was
 
04:08:25.790 --> 04:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
not in this budget
 
04:08:29.030 --> 04:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
and we can all name something that we
 
04:08:31.790 --> 04:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
wish was in this budget but it did not
 
04:08:33.889 --> 04:08:33.899 align:start position:0%
make it
 
04:08:36.229 --> 04:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
coming to a compromise is what happens
 
04:08:38.809 --> 04:08:38.819 align:start position:0%
when we listen to each other and come to
 
04:08:38.819 --> 04:08:40.010 align:start position:0%
when we listen to each other and come to
agreement

04:08:40.010 --> 04:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
04:08:43.070 --> 04:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
it does not mean we give up on our
 
04:08:46.189 --> 04:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
budget concerns no it means we keep
 
04:08:48.469 --> 04:08:48.479 align:start position:0%
working on the areas where we could not
 
04:08:49.790 --> 04:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
reach agreement
 
04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
and over the next several months
 
04:08:55.429 --> 04:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
we will continue to work on some areas
 
04:08:58.130 --> 04:08:58.140 align:start position:0%
where agreement was not reached
 
04:09:00.410 --> 04:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
this session we have learned an
 
04:09:02.929 --> 04:09:02.939 align:start position:0%
important lesson about working together
 
04:09:05.630 --> 04:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
the legislation we pass is much stronger
 
04:09:08.870 --> 04:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
when we work together Democrats and
 
04:09:08.880 --> 04:09:10.309 align:start position:0%
when we work together Democrats and
Republicans

04:09:10.309 --> 04:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
Republicans
 
04:09:12.469 --> 04:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
House and Senate
 
04:09:15.170 --> 04:09:15.180 align:start position:0%
this budget is an example of policy
 
04:09:19.070 --> 04:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
makers putting forth their best efforts
 
04:09:22.250 --> 04:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
I urge you to support the concur motion
 
04:09:25.550 --> 04:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
on the house Budget on House Bill 2 as
 
04:09:28.729 --> 04:09:28.739 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate
 
04:09:35.630 --> 04:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:37.849 --> 04:09:37.859 align:start position:0%
I rise in support of concurring on House
 
04:09:39.110 --> 04:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
Bill 2.
 
04:09:41.150 --> 04:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
building a state budget isn't easy
 
04:09:43.250 --> 04:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
especially when you have to craft it to
 
04:09:45.050 --> 04:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
meet the diverse needs of the people of
 
04:09:47.450 --> 04:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and pass muster with the
 
04:09:50.510 --> 04:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
majority of 424 members of the House and
 
04:09:50.520 --> 04:09:51.650 align:start position:0%
majority of 424 members of the House and
Senate

04:09:51.650 --> 04:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
04:09:53.570 --> 04:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
no state budget budget that I've ever
 
04:09:55.790 --> 04:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
seen is perfect but we can never let
 
04:09:58.610 --> 04:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
perfect be the enemy of good
 
04:10:00.469 --> 04:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
personally I would have liked to see
 
04:10:02.150 --> 04:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
some of the pension reform efforts that
 
04:10:04.490 --> 04:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
the house passed for our police and fire
 
04:10:06.769 --> 04:10:06.779 align:start position:0%
but I fully recognize that compromise is
 
04:10:09.050 --> 04:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
how we get things done and I look
 
04:10:10.670 --> 04:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
forward to continuing the conversation
 
04:10:13.610 --> 04:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
on pension reform moving forward
 
04:10:15.229 --> 04:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
so let me highlight some of the good
 
04:10:17.090 --> 04:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
things in this budget that we can all be
 
04:10:19.849 --> 04:10:19.859 align:start position:0%
proud of over 200 million dollars in
 
04:10:22.450 --> 04:10:22.460 align:start position:0%
Millis and rooms tax distributions to
 
04:10:25.670 --> 04:10:25.680 align:start position:0%

04:10:27.420 --> 04:10:28.790 align:start position:0%

municipalities

04:10:28.790 --> 04:10:28.800 align:start position:0%

04:10:30.950 --> 04:10:30.960 align:start position:0%

04:10:39.349 --> 04:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
investments in affordable housing and
 
04:10:41.290 --> 04:10:41.300 align:start position:0%
homelessness services
 
04:10:44.210 --> 04:10:44.220 align:start position:0%
investments in mental health system of
 
04:10:47.150 --> 04:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
care for the elderly and child care
 
04:10:49.550 --> 04:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
competitive pay increases within state
 
04:10:51.710 --> 04:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
government to help us compete in this
 
04:10:53.929 --> 04:10:53.939 align:start position:0%
tough labor market and continue to
 
04:10:56.150 --> 04:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
provide services for our citizens
 
04:10:58.729 --> 04:10:58.739 align:start position:0%
emergency power reforms
 
04:11:00.769 --> 04:11:00.779 align:start position:0%
accelerated phase out of the interest
 
04:11:02.590 --> 04:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
and dividends tax
 
04:11:04.849 --> 04:11:04.859 align:start position:0%

04:11:07.309 --> 04:11:07.319 align:start position:0%
with a seven year Sunset to give the
 
04:11:10.370 --> 04:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
legislature authority to reevaluate it
 
04:11:12.950 --> 04:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
and most importantly record investment
 
04:11:16.610 --> 04:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
in education over two billion dollars
 
04:11:19.309 --> 04:11:19.319 align:start position:0%
over the biennium where no municipality
 
04:11:22.010 --> 04:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
gets less money and Aid is targeted to
 
04:11:24.590 --> 04:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
the towns with the greatest need
 
04:11:27.050 --> 04:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
we can nitpick this for hours but let's
 
04:11:29.090 --> 04:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
face it the Senate based their budget
 
04:11:30.710 --> 04:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
based on the hard work of the house
 
04:11:33.229 --> 04:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
budget and the majority of what is in
 
04:11:34.849 --> 04:11:34.859 align:start position:0%
the Senate is what we can all be
 
04:11:36.889 --> 04:11:36.899 align:start position:0%
supportive of something that both
 
04:11:39.170 --> 04:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
parties can promote as a win for the
 
04:11:40.490 --> 04:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire
 
04:11:42.410 --> 04:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
this is not the end of the process and
 
04:11:44.150 --> 04:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
we will continue through this year and
 
04:11:46.130 --> 04:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
next year to find solutions to our
 
04:11:48.410 --> 04:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
state's problems big and small
 
04:11:51.110 --> 04:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
but join me now in this historic vote to
 
04:11:52.969 --> 04:11:52.979 align:start position:0%
concur with our colleagues and move
 
04:11:54.769 --> 04:11:54.779 align:start position:0%
forward with a budget New Hampshire
 
04:11:58.849 --> 04:11:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:00.830 --> 04:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is occur on House
 
04:12:04.309 --> 04:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
Bill 2. I
 
04:12:05.990 --> 04:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative Hines requests a roll
 
04:12:08.389 --> 04:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
call is that sufficiently seconded
 
04:12:10.729 --> 04:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded members take
 
04:12:54.769 --> 04:12:54.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:56.809 --> 04:12:56.819 align:start position:0%
the motion before us just occur on House
 
04:12:58.130 --> 04:12:58.140 align:start position:0%
Bill 2.
 
04:13:00.290 --> 04:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote
 
04:13:01.610 --> 04:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
chair recognizer representative
 
04:13:07.729 --> 04:13:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:10.429 --> 04:13:10.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
04:13:12.229 --> 04:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
know that there actually are cuts to
 
04:13:14.389 --> 04:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
education Aid to many many towns in this
 
04:13:16.670 --> 04:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
bill because inflation is running way
 
04:13:19.070 --> 04:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
over 10 percent over the two-year period
 
04:13:20.929 --> 04:13:20.939 align:start position:0%
and most towns are getting way less than
 
04:13:23.630 --> 04:13:23.640 align:start position:0%
that if I also know that again there's
 
04:13:26.150 --> 04:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
208 different changes in this bill to
 
04:13:28.969 --> 04:13:28.979 align:start position:0%
the state budget the implementation of
 
04:13:31.189 --> 04:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
and I know that nobody has read all of
 
04:13:32.870 --> 04:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
them and certainly nobody understands
 
04:13:35.450 --> 04:13:35.460 align:start position:0%
them all so I urge people to wait until
 
04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
you've actually read the bill it may be
 
04:13:39.769 --> 04:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
a great bill but we don't know that now
 
04:13:42.889 --> 04:13:42.899 align:start position:0%
so please push the red button
 
04:13:44.450 --> 04:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
share recognize Representative Steven
 
04:13:50.689 --> 04:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:52.670 --> 04:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:13:55.010 --> 04:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
if I know that in my seven terms I have
 
04:13:57.889 --> 04:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
never not once voted for a budget I was
 
04:13:59.929 --> 04:13:59.939 align:start position:0%
completely happy with because I don't
 
04:14:01.429 --> 04:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
get everything I want
 
04:14:04.010 --> 04:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
but Mr Speaker if I'm going to do today
 
04:14:07.309 --> 04:14:07.319 align:start position:0%
what I did then and vote for the budget
 
04:14:10.189 --> 04:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
that reflects the opinions of a few
 
04:14:13.670 --> 04:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
hundred people because it's our job then
 
04:14:16.969 --> 04:14:16.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:19.490 --> 04:14:19.500 align:start position:0%

I believe
 
04:15:54.110 --> 04:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
we kind of just made history
 
04:15:58.670 --> 04:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
when we passed a budget on a Voice vote
 
04:16:00.889 --> 04:16:00.899 align:start position:0%
and we just passed the buy-in a
 
04:16:02.990 --> 04:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
bipartisan budget
 
04:16:04.969 --> 04:16:04.979 align:start position:0%
with probably the highest numbers we've
 
04:16:06.110 --> 04:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
ever seen
 
04:16:07.610 --> 04:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
this chamber deserves some
 
04:16:07.620 --> 04:16:11.349 align:start position:0%
this chamber deserves some
congratulations

04:16:41.990 --> 04:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
for what reason is a memorize do you
 
04:16:44.450 --> 04:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
make a motion stage of motion I move
 
04:16:46.910 --> 04:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
that the remarks of the speaker be
 
04:16:50.510 --> 04:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:52.610 --> 04:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
kind of kind of strange for me to say
 
04:16:55.729 --> 04:16:55.739 align:start position:0%
without objection but I guess I will
 
04:17:00.229 --> 04:17:00.239 align:start position:0%

I Rise to ask your support on this
amendment

04:18:48.790 --> 04:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:18:52.150 --> 04:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
04:18:52.160 --> 04:18:53.769 align:start position:0%
this amendment
accomplishes

04:18:53.769 --> 04:18:53.779 align:start position:0%
accomplishes
 
04:18:56.570 --> 04:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
all the goals of the original bill but
 
04:18:58.849 --> 04:18:58.859 align:start position:0%
does it without some of the unintended
 
04:18:58.859 --> 04:19:00.590 align:start position:0%
does it without some of the unintended
consequences

04:19:00.590 --> 04:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
so the question is what are those goals
 
04:19:06.710 --> 04:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
of the original Bill and that does get a
 
04:19:08.210 --> 04:19:08.220 align:start position:0%
little complicated
 
04:19:10.910 --> 04:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
has explained to the committee the
 
04:19:14.750 --> 04:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of submitting SB 42 was to
 
04:19:16.729 --> 04:19:16.739 align:start position:0%
address a situation that came up during
 
04:19:18.590 --> 04:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
the covet pandemic
 
04:19:22.790 --> 04:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
as I think we all know the unemployment
 
04:19:26.929 --> 04:19:26.939 align:start position:0%
system came under some strain then with
 
04:19:29.030 --> 04:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
more people applying for unemployment
 
04:19:32.150 --> 04:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
benefits more people receiving them the
 
04:19:34.849 --> 04:19:34.859 align:start position:0%
rules changing on who is eligible for
 
04:19:38.530 --> 04:19:38.540 align:start position:0%
for benefits and federal money coming in
 
04:19:42.650 --> 04:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
to make up some of that difference in
 
04:19:42.660 --> 04:19:44.870 align:start position:0%
to make up some of that difference in
funding

04:19:44.870 --> 04:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:19:44.880 --> 04:19:46.370 align:start position:0%
funding
um

04:19:46.370 --> 04:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:49.250 --> 04:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
it got very complicated and it was
 
04:19:49.260 --> 04:19:50.570 align:start position:0%
it got very complicated and it was
confusing

04:19:50.570 --> 04:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
04:19:53.110 --> 04:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
now just one of these complications
 
04:19:57.830 --> 04:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
involves what happens in the case that
 
04:20:00.130 --> 04:20:00.140 align:start position:0%
Departments of Labor call overpayment
 
04:20:03.229 --> 04:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
more specifically what happens when
 
04:20:05.870 --> 04:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
someone applies for unemployment
 
04:20:09.050 --> 04:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
but misrepresents their situation and
 
04:20:11.630 --> 04:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
then receives money for which they are
 
04:20:13.910 --> 04:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
not eligible
 
04:20:16.010 --> 04:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
the simple answer is they have to pay it
 
04:20:16.020 --> 04:20:16.750 align:start position:0%
the simple answer is they have to pay it
back

04:20:16.750 --> 04:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
back
 
04:20:19.070 --> 04:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
but there's a difference between state
 
04:20:22.010 --> 04:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
and federal law under state law
 
04:20:25.429 --> 04:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
any money that's not paid back to the
 
04:20:28.130 --> 04:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
trust fund within a timely fashion will
 
04:20:31.330 --> 04:20:31.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:35.990 --> 04:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
in federal law that doesn't occur and so
 
04:20:38.689 --> 04:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
this bill is amended will address that
 
04:20:42.110 --> 04:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
situation and it will do it through the
 
04:20:45.469 --> 04:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
Department's rulemaking process
 
04:20:47.330 --> 04:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
now that probably sounds even more
 
04:20:49.490 --> 04:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
complicated but I think it's a lot
 
04:20:52.610 --> 04:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
simpler than it sounds because the
 
04:20:55.309 --> 04:20:55.319 align:start position:0%
existing department rules already deal
 
04:20:57.729 --> 04:20:57.739 align:start position:0%
with this what happens
 
04:21:00.349 --> 04:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
when there are differing individual
 
04:21:00.359 --> 04:21:02.269 align:start position:0%
when there are differing individual
situations

04:21:02.269 --> 04:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
situations
 
04:21:06.349 --> 04:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
and and when you play pay interest
 
04:21:06.359 --> 04:21:07.250 align:start position:0%
and and when you play pay interest
um

04:21:07.250 --> 04:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:08.929 --> 04:21:08.939 align:start position:0%
you'll probably hear from some of the
 
04:21:10.910 --> 04:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
other speakers about some of those
 
04:21:13.189 --> 04:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
conditions where people really shouldn't
 
04:21:13.199 --> 04:21:14.650 align:start position:0%
conditions where people really shouldn't
be

04:21:14.650 --> 04:21:14.660 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:21:17.210 --> 04:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
paying interest when they're already
 
04:21:19.150 --> 04:21:19.160 align:start position:0%
down when they're already out of work
 
04:21:22.689 --> 04:21:22.699 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of gray area between
 
04:21:25.550 --> 04:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
you got money that was no fault of your
 
04:21:28.189 --> 04:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
own and you got money by committing a
 
04:21:30.769 --> 04:21:30.779 align:start position:0%
felony and you're going to jail
 
04:21:33.229 --> 04:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
and through the rulemaking process we
 
04:21:35.750 --> 04:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
can address that continuum
 
04:21:39.349 --> 04:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
just to give an example
 
04:21:42.170 --> 04:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
under the current rules whether you pay
 
04:21:45.110 --> 04:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
interest or not is not a given an
 
04:21:48.349 --> 04:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
obvious exception is let's say I receive
 
04:21:51.469 --> 04:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
money for which I was not eligible but
 
04:21:54.290 --> 04:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
it was through no fault of my own in
 
04:21:56.630 --> 04:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
that case I get to keep the money and
 
04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
obviously I don't pay any interest on it
 
04:22:02.990 --> 04:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
but what if it was my fault
 
04:22:05.330 --> 04:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
if I if that money that I wasn't
 
04:22:07.729 --> 04:22:07.739 align:start position:0%
supposed to receive that isn't mine if I
 
04:22:10.429 --> 04:22:10.439 align:start position:0%
can give that back to the state within
 
04:22:12.889 --> 04:22:12.899 align:start position:0%
the time limit then I also don't pay
 
04:22:12.899 --> 04:22:14.090 align:start position:0%
the time limit then I also don't pay
interest

04:22:14.090 --> 04:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
interest
 
04:22:16.429 --> 04:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
if I can't
 
04:22:19.250 --> 04:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
and I go to the state and I work out a
 
04:22:20.689 --> 04:22:20.699 align:start position:0%
payment plan
 
04:22:23.929 --> 04:22:23.939 align:start position:0%
then that interest will be waived at the
 
04:22:25.610 --> 04:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
end of it when I've paid off the
 
04:22:27.349 --> 04:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
original amount
 
04:22:30.410 --> 04:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
and if my financial situation is such
 
04:22:33.349 --> 04:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
that I simply can't afford to pay the
 
04:22:36.650 --> 04:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
money back the rules in place already
 
04:22:40.309 --> 04:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
allow for giving that debt
 
04:22:43.969 --> 04:22:43.979 align:start position:0%
so this amendment despite its length
 
04:22:46.969 --> 04:22:46.979 align:start position:0%
really is simple extending that process
 
04:22:49.790 --> 04:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
to the interest so that it won't be
 
04:22:51.889 --> 04:22:51.899 align:start position:0%
charged up front rather than being
 
04:22:54.650 --> 04:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
waived at the at the end now it is true
 
04:22:56.990 --> 04:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
that there are other states many states
 
04:22:59.689 --> 04:22:59.699 align:start position:0%
that don't charge interest at all
 
04:23:02.330 --> 04:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
but if you look at it many of those
 
04:23:05.750 --> 04:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
states have other ways to chase down to
 
04:23:08.510 --> 04:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
claw back this money that is owed by
 
04:23:10.010 --> 04:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
people who shouldn't have gotten in the
 
04:23:13.250 --> 04:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
first place in New Hampshire this is it
 
04:23:16.429 --> 04:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
if someone doesn't pay back money that
 
04:23:19.130 --> 04:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have received our only
 
04:23:22.610 --> 04:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
way to motivate them to pay it back is
 
04:23:24.889 --> 04:23:24.899 align:start position:0%
that if they don't pay it in a timely
 
04:23:29.689 --> 04:23:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:32.750 --> 04:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
we have the underlying Bill the amended
 
04:23:35.570 --> 04:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
Bill we're both going for the same goal
 
04:23:39.830 --> 04:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just asking you to support me I
 
04:23:42.710 --> 04:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
believe as amended that
 
04:23:45.650 --> 04:23:45.660 align:start position:0%
um this is a better path to getting to
 
04:23:46.969 --> 04:23:46.979 align:start position:0%
where we want to be
 
04:23:49.370 --> 04:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
so I ask you please support the Motion
 
04:23:52.250 --> 04:23:52.260 align:start position:0%

04:23:52.260 --> 04:23:59.269 align:start position:0%

04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%

chair recognizes representative Brian
 
04:24:01.020 --> 04:24:05.269 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Brian

04:24:11.929 --> 04:24:11.939 align:start position:0%
I rise in opposition to amendment number
 
04:24:11.939 --> 04:24:14.570 align:start position:0%
I rise in opposition to amendment number
1799h

04:24:14.570 --> 04:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
1799h
 
04:24:17.750 --> 04:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
in the words of the sponsor of sb42 this
 
04:24:20.090 --> 04:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
amendment effectively guts the bill
 
04:24:22.010 --> 04:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill is we received it
 
04:24:23.990 --> 04:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
from the other body is to prevent the
 
04:24:25.969 --> 04:24:25.979 align:start position:0%
Department of Employment Security from
 
04:24:28.070 --> 04:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
charging interest on overpayments of
 
04:24:30.830 --> 04:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
benefits it except in instances and this
 
04:24:33.410 --> 04:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
is a quote where the recipient willfully
 
04:24:35.210 --> 04:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
makes a false statement or
 
04:24:37.429 --> 04:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
representation or knowingly fails to
 
04:24:40.550 --> 04:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
disclose a material fact to obtain or
 
04:24:44.630 --> 04:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
increase unemployment compensation
 
04:24:47.269 --> 04:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
the process of obtaining an unemployment
 
04:24:49.250 --> 04:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
compensation involves filing with the
 
04:24:51.610 --> 04:24:51.620 align:start position:0%
Department on a weekly basis to provide
 
04:24:54.410 --> 04:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
assurance that the recipient is doing
 
04:24:56.530 --> 04:24:56.540 align:start position:0%
everything necessary to remain qualified
 
04:25:00.710 --> 04:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
and by providing earnings information to
 
04:25:02.570 --> 04:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
establish the amount of compensation
 
04:25:04.189 --> 04:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
that is due
 
04:25:06.830 --> 04:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
it is not difficult to make a mistake in
 
04:25:09.469 --> 04:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
one or more of these weekly applications
 
04:25:11.689 --> 04:25:11.699 align:start position:0%
I suggest that no interest should be
 
04:25:13.610 --> 04:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
charged on the overpayment when the
 
04:25:16.130 --> 04:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
overpayment is due to an honest mistake
 
04:25:18.889 --> 04:25:18.899 align:start position:0%
it should indeed be repaid but without
 
04:25:21.229 --> 04:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
the accrual of Interest
 
04:25:23.210 --> 04:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
this amendment allows the department to
 
04:25:25.309 --> 04:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
decide on a case-by-case basis whether
 
04:25:27.410 --> 04:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
to charge interest or not
 
04:25:29.210 --> 04:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
the department has assured us they will
 
04:25:30.830 --> 04:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
write rules to determine when it would
 
04:25:33.710 --> 04:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
exercise this this discretion that this
 
04:25:35.269 --> 04:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
amendment provides
 
04:25:38.269 --> 04:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
I suggest rather than writing rules on
 
04:25:40.309 --> 04:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
its discretion the department might
 
04:25:42.229 --> 04:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
instead write rules to Define when a
 
04:25:44.510 --> 04:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
fraudulent claim has occurred
 
04:25:46.250 --> 04:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
this would honor the intent of the bill
 
04:25:48.649 --> 04:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
and treat the unemployment recipients
 
04:25:48.659 --> 04:25:49.849 align:start position:0%
and treat the unemployment recipients
fairly

04:25:49.849 --> 04:25:49.859 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
04:25:51.950 --> 04:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
please join me in pressing the red
 
04:25:54.170 --> 04:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
button to defeat defeat this amendment
 
04:26:04.130 --> 04:26:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:04.140 --> 04:26:07.490 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:26:07.490 --> 04:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:08.929 --> 04:26:08.939 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't hear you Mr Speaker
 
04:26:10.610 --> 04:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
was I recognized

yes thank you all right guys I
 
04:26:15.710 --> 04:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
understand all right labor after launch
 
04:26:17.809 --> 04:26:17.819 align:start position:0%
not probably the cool thing I was
 
04:26:19.309 --> 04:26:19.319 align:start position:0%
watching people I know we're all falling
 
04:26:21.050 --> 04:26:21.060 align:start position:0%
to see from our wonderful lunch we had
 
04:26:23.870 --> 04:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
from the Real Estate Association so I'm
 
04:26:26.389 --> 04:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
going to be brief and provide some facts
 
04:26:26.399 --> 04:26:27.530 align:start position:0%
going to be brief and provide some facts
here

04:26:27.530 --> 04:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:26:28.969 --> 04:26:28.979 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire
 
04:26:30.830 --> 04:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
if you get unemployment benefits and for
 
04:26:32.630 --> 04:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
some reason you don't shouldn't have
 
04:26:34.250 --> 04:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
received them you have to pay it back
 
04:26:36.469 --> 04:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
with interest 15 states in this country
 
04:26:38.030 --> 04:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:26:41.269 --> 04:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
another 20 do not but the the balance of
 
04:26:41.279 --> 04:26:42.410 align:start position:0%
another 20 do not but the the balance of
them

04:26:42.410 --> 04:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:26:45.050 --> 04:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
they take it from you some other way
 
04:26:47.030 --> 04:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
if there's an income tax in your state
 
04:26:48.590 --> 04:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
they will take your income tax return
 
04:26:52.250 --> 04:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
okay they can Levy your wages we don't
 
04:26:53.990 --> 04:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
do any of that in New Hampshire
 
04:26:56.269 --> 04:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
okay it's simple
 
04:26:58.550 --> 04:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
if you are have committed fraud the
 
04:27:00.410 --> 04:27:00.420 align:start position:0%
Fraud Unit comes after you
 
04:27:02.389 --> 04:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of these gray areas in
 
04:27:04.130 --> 04:27:04.140 align:start position:0%
between and this is the New Hampshire
 
04:27:06.290 --> 04:27:06.300 align:start position:0%
way of not going after anybody for
 
04:27:08.389 --> 04:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
making mistakes but kind of on the
 
04:27:10.490 --> 04:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
bubble of were they mistakes or we just
 
04:27:12.530 --> 04:27:12.540 align:start position:0%
did not quite tell them the truth
 
04:27:14.809 --> 04:27:14.819 align:start position:0%
these are examples
 
04:27:17.210 --> 04:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
someone gets laid off excuse me someone
 
04:27:17.220 --> 04:27:18.830 align:start position:0%
someone gets laid off excuse me someone
quits

04:27:18.830 --> 04:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
quits
 
04:27:21.170 --> 04:27:21.180 align:start position:0%
then goes to unemployment Securities
 
04:27:23.269 --> 04:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
this is a true story it says
 
04:27:23.279 --> 04:27:23.870 align:start position:0%
this is a true story it says
um

04:27:23.870 --> 04:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:27.229 --> 04:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
I I uh I got excuse me they quit someone
 
04:27:28.969 --> 04:27:28.979 align:start position:0%
comes advice I got laid off so they get
 
04:27:30.830 --> 04:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
benefits and what happens is the
 
04:27:32.030 --> 04:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
department sends something to the
 
04:27:34.130 --> 04:27:34.140 align:start position:0%
employer the employer writes back no
 
04:27:35.990 --> 04:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
they quit
 
04:27:37.729 --> 04:27:37.739 align:start position:0%
that individual had to pay that money
 
04:27:37.739 --> 04:27:40.070 align:start position:0%
that individual had to pay that money
back

04:27:40.070 --> 04:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:42.889 --> 04:27:42.899 align:start position:0%
another situation where someone a
 
04:27:45.530 --> 04:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
seasonal employee received a bonus when
 
04:27:47.450 --> 04:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
they left at the end of the season
 
04:27:48.830 --> 04:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
well according to unemployment
 
04:27:51.649 --> 04:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
Securities you need to report that they
 
04:27:51.659 --> 04:27:52.910 align:start position:0%
Securities you need to report that they
didn't

04:27:52.910 --> 04:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
04:27:55.189 --> 04:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
they received that bonus the same time
 
04:27:56.570 --> 04:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
they were receiving unemployment
 
04:28:01.250 --> 04:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
benefits that's wrong that's fraudulent
 
04:28:02.809 --> 04:28:02.819 align:start position:0%
but the department doesn't want to go
 
04:28:04.429 --> 04:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
after everybody for some of these small
 
04:28:04.439 --> 04:28:06.649 align:start position:0%
after everybody for some of these small
infractions

04:28:06.649 --> 04:28:06.659 align:start position:0%
infractions
 
04:28:09.469 --> 04:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes the department is wrong
 
04:28:11.990 --> 04:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
at a situation where a woman went for a
 
04:28:14.030 --> 04:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
job went and got some training she was
 
04:28:16.370 --> 04:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
paid while she was training that day
 
04:28:18.649 --> 04:28:18.659 align:start position:0%
she did not report the income she didn't
 
04:28:20.210 --> 04:28:20.220 align:start position:0%
end up taking the job didn't like the
 
04:28:22.670 --> 04:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
job did not report the income but then
 
04:28:24.889 --> 04:28:24.899 align:start position:0%
two weeks later dawned on her when she
 
04:28:26.630 --> 04:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
filled out the form I have to say that I
 
04:28:28.490 --> 04:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
received this income
 
04:28:30.710 --> 04:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
she went for a hearing the hearings
 
04:28:31.969 --> 04:28:31.979 align:start position:0%
officer said
 
04:28:34.849 --> 04:28:34.859 align:start position:0%
okay we would think that's a mistake
 
04:28:36.469 --> 04:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
We're Not Gonna
 
04:28:39.530 --> 04:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
ask you to pay that back
 
04:28:41.450 --> 04:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
it is very common in the state of New
 
04:28:41.460 --> 04:28:42.710 align:start position:0%
it is very common in the state of New
Hampshire

04:28:42.710 --> 04:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:28:45.229 --> 04:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
to allow departments to have
 
04:28:48.229 --> 04:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh decision-making Authority on these
 
04:28:50.090 --> 04:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
things it's well known in the Department
 
04:28:52.429 --> 04:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
of Labor if you do not have workers
 
04:28:54.469 --> 04:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
compensation it's a twenty five hundred
 
04:28:56.149 --> 04:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
dollar fine plus a hundred dollars a day
 
04:29:00.050 --> 04:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:01.849 --> 04:29:01.859 align:start position:0%
the department doesn't always go after
 
04:29:03.710 --> 04:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
people for fifty thousand dollars goes
 
04:29:05.210 --> 04:29:05.220 align:start position:0%
in at workers compensation for six
 
04:29:09.229 --> 04:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
months if they deemed it was a mistake
 
04:29:12.050 --> 04:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
so they'll come up with a fine they'll
 
04:29:13.969 --> 04:29:13.979 align:start position:0%
agree on something for about twenty five
 
04:29:15.050 --> 04:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars that's the New Hampshire
 
04:29:17.210 --> 04:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
way of doing things that's a May versus
 
04:29:18.769 --> 04:29:18.779 align:start position:0%
a shell we talked about that someone
 
04:29:20.269 --> 04:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
brought that up earlier today a May
 
04:29:22.610 --> 04:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
versus a shell in our laws that's what
 
04:29:25.610 --> 04:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
this amendment tries to do make it a May
 
04:29:27.410 --> 04:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
versus a show
 
04:29:29.510 --> 04:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
give the discretion through rulemaking
 
04:29:32.090 --> 04:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
to allow the department to go after the
 
04:29:34.610 --> 04:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
people that are really fraudulent
 
04:29:36.170 --> 04:29:36.180 align:start position:0%
and the people that kind of make a
 
04:29:37.849 --> 04:29:37.859 align:start position:0%
mistake and don't quite
 
04:29:39.889 --> 04:29:39.899 align:start position:0%
tell the whole story or whatever we
 
04:29:42.229 --> 04:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
don't want to cause a problem
 
04:29:44.090 --> 04:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
where we're going after people that's
 
04:29:48.830 --> 04:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:51.290 --> 04:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
all the benefits are paid 100 by the
 
04:29:55.189 --> 04:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
employer into the work unemployment fund
 
04:29:58.250 --> 04:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
we should not allow people to
 
04:30:00.590 --> 04:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
be able to get funds they don't deserve
 
04:30:02.809 --> 04:30:02.819 align:start position:0%
because it will hurt the people that do
 
04:30:06.410 --> 04:30:06.420 align:start position:0%
deserve those unemployment benefits
 
04:30:09.530 --> 04:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
the amendment allows a department to go
 
04:30:11.389 --> 04:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
to rules
 
04:30:13.070 --> 04:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
and to be able to make these decisions
 
04:30:15.530 --> 04:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
so they can be fair with people
 
04:30:19.309 --> 04:30:19.319 align:start position:0%
this one either this thing about we pay
 
04:30:21.530 --> 04:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
interest we charge you interest nope now
 
04:30:22.309 --> 04:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
we're not going to charge you any
 
04:30:22.319 --> 04:30:24.469 align:start position:0%
we're not going to charge you any
interest

04:30:24.469 --> 04:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
interest
 
04:30:28.490 --> 04:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
why why are we going from here to there
 
04:30:31.070 --> 04:30:31.080 align:start position:0%

04:30:34.189 --> 04:30:34.199 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker if I know that it is not
 
04:32:55.969 --> 04:32:55.979 align:start position:0%
difficult to make a mistake when filing

04:35:41.150 --> 04:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:43.551 --> 04:35:43.561 align:start position:0%
having done this for a number of years
 
04:35:49.189 --> 04:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:53.209 --> 04:35:53.219 align:start position:0%
the departments in New Hampshire
 
04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
are so much different than some of the
 
04:35:57.470 --> 04:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
states to our state to our East and our
 
04:35:57.480 --> 04:35:58.670 align:start position:0%
states to our state to our East and our
South

04:35:58.670 --> 04:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
South
 
04:36:00.830 --> 04:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
as to how they deal with people
 
04:36:03.410 --> 04:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm concerned that by passing this
 
04:36:03.420 --> 04:36:05.269 align:start position:0%
and I'm concerned that by passing this
bill

04:36:05.269 --> 04:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:36:07.490 --> 04:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
we will put Employment Securities in a
 
04:36:10.070 --> 04:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
position where
 
04:36:12.109 --> 04:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
they won't give these people a pass
 
04:36:12.119 --> 04:36:14.750 align:start position:0%
they won't give these people a pass
anymore

04:36:14.750 --> 04:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:16.429 --> 04:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
one of these examples I gave it was
 
04:36:18.289 --> 04:36:18.299 align:start position:0%
eight hundred dollars it was had to be
 
04:36:20.090 --> 04:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
returned the other one was 300 and the
 
04:36:23.750 --> 04:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:25.910 --> 04:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
will they consider these just fraud and
 
04:36:29.929 --> 04:36:29.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:31.789 --> 04:36:31.799 align:start position:0%
I think it's a good possibility and I
 
04:36:34.849 --> 04:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
think that was a darn shame
 
04:36:37.429 --> 04:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
I I always question why we mess with
 
04:36:38.631 --> 04:36:38.641 align:start position:0%
something that's
 
04:36:40.189 --> 04:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
not broken
 
04:36:43.970 --> 04:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
I would ask you to vote no on the bill
 
04:36:46.070 --> 04:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
all right please
 
04:36:54.769 --> 04:36:54.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:00.289 --> 04:37:00.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:02.269 --> 04:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
I want to set the record straight this
 
04:37:04.131 --> 04:37:04.141 align:start position:0%
is not about trust for the Department of
 
04:37:05.349 --> 04:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
Employment Security
 
04:37:07.250 --> 04:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
I have
 
04:37:09.170 --> 04:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
I would expect an equal amount of
 
04:37:11.929 --> 04:37:11.939 align:start position:0%
respect for those folks as my chairman
 
04:37:11.939 --> 04:37:12.730 align:start position:0%
respect for those folks as my chairman
does

04:37:12.730 --> 04:37:12.740 align:start position:0%
does
 
04:37:15.590 --> 04:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
this is just about defining exactly
 
04:37:17.510 --> 04:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
where the line is
 
04:37:20.830 --> 04:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
for where you charge interest or don't
 
04:37:24.590 --> 04:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
and you know I think the the bills that
 
04:37:25.730 --> 04:37:25.740 align:start position:0%
came from
 
04:37:27.730 --> 04:37:27.740 align:start position:0%
the other side of the wall
 
04:37:31.070 --> 04:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
made it pretty clear if you engaged in
 
04:37:33.590 --> 04:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
misrep intentional misrepresent
 
04:37:33.600 --> 04:37:36.529 align:start position:0%
misrep intentional misrepresent
misrepresentation

04:37:36.529 --> 04:37:36.539 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation
 
04:37:39.170 --> 04:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
then you're going to pay interest
 
04:37:42.410 --> 04:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
if it reaches the level of fraud you're
 
04:37:44.390 --> 04:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
probably going to go to jail
 
04:37:44.400 --> 04:37:44.990 align:start position:0%
probably going to go to jail
um

04:37:44.990 --> 04:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:47.150 --> 04:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is if it was an
 
04:37:48.590 --> 04:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
honest mistake
 
04:37:51.529 --> 04:37:51.539 align:start position:0%
and errors are commonly made then there
 
04:37:53.330 --> 04:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
will be no interest you'll pay back the
 
04:37:56.029 --> 04:37:56.039 align:start position:0%
amount that you weren't entitled to but
 
04:37:57.529 --> 04:37:57.539 align:start position:0%
you won't pay any interest so I think
 
04:38:00.529 --> 04:38:00.539 align:start position:0%
it's it's a fair line to draw if you if
 
04:38:03.590 --> 04:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's a mistake no interest if it's
 
04:38:06.410 --> 04:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
intentional you pay interest so I ask
 
04:38:09.410 --> 04:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
you to support the bill as it came to
 
04:38:13.189 --> 04:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:15.109 --> 04:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
motion before us is ought to pass in
 
04:38:17.869 --> 04:38:17.879 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill authority too
 
04:38:20.209 --> 04:38:20.219 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question
 
04:38:23.631 --> 04:38:23.641 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:42:36.830 --> 04:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
we've heard bills a few bills this year
 
04:42:38.690 --> 04:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
that try to legislate items that should
 
04:42:40.128 --> 04:42:40.138 align:start position:0%
be part of the contract negotiation
 
04:42:42.708 --> 04:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
process in my experience as a member of
 
04:42:43.970 --> 04:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
this committee we have tried to make
 
04:42:46.368 --> 04:42:46.378 align:start position:0%
sure the negotiations between labor and
 
04:42:47.750 --> 04:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
management have not been subject to
 
04:42:49.550 --> 04:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
intrusions by state law
 
04:42:51.110 --> 04:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
while there are items in law that set
 
04:42:53.690 --> 04:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
dates for specific budgetary deadlines
 
04:42:56.030 --> 04:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
this bill tries to define a bargaining
 
04:42:57.708 --> 04:42:57.718 align:start position:0%
process by creating an arbitrary number
 
04:43:00.170 --> 04:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
of days to begin the negotiation process
 
04:43:02.330 --> 04:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
it is a minority position that this is
 
04:43:04.010 --> 04:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
an item that should be negotiated for
 
04:43:06.470 --> 04:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
and not placed in state law thank you Mr
 
04:43:06.480 --> 04:43:08.510 align:start position:0%
and not placed in state law thank you Mr
Speaker

04:43:08.510 --> 04:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
Speaker
 
04:43:10.610 --> 04:43:10.620 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan's recognized to
 
04:43:14.810 --> 04:43:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:16.490 --> 04:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:43:21.788 --> 04:43:21.798 align:start position:0%
I rise in support of sb193
 
04:43:24.230 --> 04:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
scp-193 is a simple bill that will help
 
04:43:25.850 --> 04:43:25.860 align:start position:0%
keep public sector negotiations
 
04:43:28.010 --> 04:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
operating efficiently
 
04:43:30.170 --> 04:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
it requires public sector employees
 
04:43:33.190 --> 04:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
employers and employee groups to meet
 
04:43:36.410 --> 04:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
for negotiations within 10 business days
 
04:43:38.990 --> 04:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
after one party or the other has
 
04:43:41.690 --> 04:43:41.700 align:start position:0%
provided a written request
 
04:43:43.490 --> 04:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
this timeline can be waived through
 
04:43:45.288 --> 04:43:45.298 align:start position:0%
mutual agreement
 
04:43:48.350 --> 04:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
it is unusual for an employer or an
 
04:43:50.150 --> 04:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
employee group to delay meeting with the
 
04:43:51.110 --> 04:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
other party
 
04:43:53.570 --> 04:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
when it does happen though it's a sign
 
04:43:56.750 --> 04:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
of significant dysfunction
 
04:43:59.448 --> 04:43:59.458 align:start position:0%
it has been argued that the legislature
 
04:44:00.770 --> 04:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
should not interfere with the parties
 
04:44:03.110 --> 04:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
during negotiations I would generally
 
04:44:04.970 --> 04:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
agree that issues should be worked out
 
04:44:06.708 --> 04:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
between the parties
 
04:44:08.810 --> 04:44:08.820 align:start position:0%
in this case the parties are showing
 
04:44:10.910 --> 04:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
that they are unable or unwilling to
 
04:44:12.470 --> 04:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
work things out
 
04:44:16.128 --> 04:44:16.138 align:start position:0%
by passing SB 193 we will provide the
 
04:44:18.288 --> 04:44:18.298 align:start position:0%
the gentle nudge needed to keep
 
04:44:20.448 --> 04:44:20.458 align:start position:0%
negotiations moving along
 
04:44:22.010 --> 04:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
we are not telling them what to
 
04:44:24.650 --> 04:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
negotiate or what to agree on we're
 
04:44:26.270 --> 04:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
simply telling them to engage in the
 
04:44:26.280 --> 04:44:27.948 align:start position:0%
simply telling them to engage in the
process

04:44:27.948 --> 04:44:27.958 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:44:31.190 --> 04:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
RSA 273a already requires the parties to
 
04:44:33.230 --> 04:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
meet this bill simply puts a definition
 
04:44:35.448 --> 04:44:35.458 align:start position:0%
on how soon they must meet
 
04:44:36.890 --> 04:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
the Public Employee Labor Relations
 
04:44:39.170 --> 04:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
Board would enforce this rule but it
 
04:44:40.970 --> 04:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
would not likely be needed as a 10
 
04:44:42.590 --> 04:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
business day requirement would be easy
 
04:44:43.910 --> 04:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
to comply with
 
04:44:45.590 --> 04:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
please push the green button to support
 
04:44:48.288 --> 04:44:48.298 align:start position:0%
this bipartisan piece of legislation and
 
04:44:53.810 --> 04:44:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:55.670 --> 04:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
questions on the majority report of

04:44:58.970 --> 04:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
04:45:03.350 --> 04:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:04.910 --> 04:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
this will be a division vote members
 
04:45:50.750 --> 04:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:59.930 --> 04:45:59.940 align:start position:0%

as amended
 
04:46:06.350 --> 04:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
this is a division vote representative
 
04:46:07.730 --> 04:46:07.740 align:start position:0%
infant science recognized for
 
04:46:09.830 --> 04:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
04:46:11.990 --> 04:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know the labor
 
04:46:13.490 --> 04:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
committee does not like to get involved
 
04:46:15.590 --> 04:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
with dictating rules and procedures for
 
04:46:19.310 --> 04:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
negotiations and Municipal contracts
 
04:46:21.470 --> 04:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
if I know that this better left up to
 
04:46:25.128 --> 04:46:25.138 align:start position:0%
the nlrb to decide
 
04:46:28.070 --> 04:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
and that creating an arbitrary amount of
 
04:46:31.190 --> 04:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
days is 10 days to Define what is bad
 
04:46:31.200 --> 04:46:32.208 align:start position:0%
days is 10 days to Define what is bad
faith

04:46:32.208 --> 04:46:32.218 align:start position:0%
faith
 
04:46:35.090 --> 04:46:35.100 align:start position:0%
is doing exactly what the committee does
 
04:46:36.948 --> 04:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
not like to do I would ask you to vote
 
04:46:36.958 --> 04:46:40.128 align:start position:0%
not like to do I would ask you to vote
no

04:46:40.128 --> 04:46:40.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:42.050 --> 04:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
representative Bouchard's recognized for

04:46:53.810 --> 04:46:53.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:46:57.890 --> 04:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I believe
 
04:46:59.810 --> 04:46:59.820 align:start position:0%
it is the obligation of the public
 
04:47:02.330 --> 04:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
employer and the certified employee
 
04:47:06.350 --> 04:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
organization to negotiate in good faith
 
04:47:10.550 --> 04:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if I believe good faith
 
04:47:13.970 --> 04:47:13.980 align:start position:0%
involves meeting at a reasonable time
 
04:47:16.310 --> 04:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
and place
 
04:47:18.230 --> 04:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker
 
04:47:21.110 --> 04:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
if I believe that good faith means to
 
04:47:24.050 --> 04:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
meet within 10 business days after
 
04:47:27.590 --> 04:47:27.600 align:start position:0%

Representatives the analysis of this
 
04:50:02.270 --> 04:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
bill states that its intent is to
 
04:50:04.430 --> 04:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
clarify residency of transient
 
04:50:05.990 --> 04:50:06.000 align:start position:0%

for local assistance instead of
 
04:50:13.010 --> 04:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
clarifying however the bill makes the
 
04:50:15.650 --> 04:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
process more difficult and unclear
 
04:50:18.110 --> 04:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
current irsa states that any person
 
04:50:20.990 --> 04:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
unable to support themselves is entitled
 
04:50:23.570 --> 04:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
to temporary assistance
 
04:50:26.628 --> 04:50:26.638 align:start position:0%
irsa also already specifies that costs
 
04:50:28.368 --> 04:50:28.378 align:start position:0%
are to be paid for by the town of
 
04:50:31.070 --> 04:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
residence of the person
 
04:50:33.410 --> 04:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
this bill restricts a person's rights by
 
04:50:35.448 --> 04:50:35.458 align:start position:0%
placing a 30-day restriction on an
 
04:50:37.550 --> 04:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
individual requiring them to support
 
04:50:40.190 --> 04:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
themselves without municipal or other
 
04:50:42.650 --> 04:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
provider assistance in order to
 
04:50:44.390 --> 04:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
transition residency to a new
 
04:50:44.400 --> 04:50:46.310 align:start position:0%

04:50:46.310 --> 04:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
04:50:48.948 --> 04:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
and would restrict someone's ability to

choose their place of residence based on
 
04:50:54.230 --> 04:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
a homeless or transient condition
 
04:50:55.910 --> 04:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
how can a homeless person support
 
04:50:57.830 --> 04:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
themselves and possibly their family
 
04:51:00.170 --> 04:51:00.180 align:start position:0%
without assistance the bill appears to
 
04:51:02.570 --> 04:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
be more about changes in residency than
 
04:51:05.150 --> 04:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
about renumeration for services rendered
 
04:51:08.330 --> 04:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
this bill is completely unnecessary and
 
04:51:10.128 --> 04:51:10.138 align:start position:0%
Ashley makes things more difficult for
 
04:51:12.650 --> 04:51:12.660 align:start position:0%

changes in residency status as it is
 
04:55:55.070 --> 04:55:55.080 align:start position:0%

and if I further know our laws already
 
04:56:00.110 --> 04:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
speak to how the cost for transients
 
04:56:02.390 --> 04:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
paid for one town are to be recovered

currently resides and finally Mr Speaker

if I know this bill confuses and
 
04:56:10.910 --> 04:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
complicates the issue rather than
 
04:56:14.090 --> 04:56:14.100 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:56:31.550 --> 04:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that all
 
04:56:33.650 --> 04:56:33.660 align:start position:0%
municipalities are required to assist
 
04:56:36.170 --> 04:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
persons in need but have varying
 
04:56:38.868 --> 04:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
capacity for that responsibility and
 
04:56:41.208 --> 04:56:41.218 align:start position:0%
thus request the assistance of
 
04:56:43.250 --> 04:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
surrounding communities with no mention
 
04:56:46.730 --> 04:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
of costs involved and if I know that SB
 
04:56:49.250 --> 04:56:49.260 align:start position:0%

04:56:51.590 --> 04:56:51.600 align:start position:0%

and if I know this bill requires rather
 
04:57:04.670 --> 04:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
than suggests Municipal welfare officers
 
04:57:07.850 --> 04:57:07.860 align:start position:0%
to coordinate care and costs so that no
 
04:57:10.550 --> 04:57:10.560 align:start position:0%

04:59:45.650 --> 04:59:45.660 align:start position:0%

05:01:09.350 --> 05:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to lay Senate
 
05:01:12.650 --> 05:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
Bill 132 on the table and this is a roll
 
05:01:14.150 --> 05:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
call vote
 
05:01:15.948 --> 05:01:15.958 align:start position:0%
representative Davis is recognized for
 
05:01:21.350 --> 05:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:24.288 --> 05:01:24.298 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:01:28.128 --> 05:01:28.138 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that this bill in
 
05:01:30.170 --> 05:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
some form or fashion has come before the
 
05:01:32.628 --> 05:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
house at least three times in the past
 
05:01:35.750 --> 05:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
and each time we have seen fit to defeat
 
05:01:37.730 --> 05:01:37.740 align:start position:0%
or table it
 
05:01:40.730 --> 05:01:40.740 align:start position:0%
whatever party held the majority
 
05:01:42.650 --> 05:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
and we did that because it is an
 
05:01:46.128 --> 05:01:46.138 align:start position:0%
improper imposition of federal law onto
 
05:01:48.230 --> 05:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
our communities where citizens elect
 
05:01:50.448 --> 05:01:50.458 align:start position:0%
officials to represent their interests
 
05:01:53.570 --> 05:01:53.580 align:start position:0%
not to do Washington's bidding
 
05:01:56.030 --> 05:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill represents
 
05:01:58.430 --> 05:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
a sweeping prohibition against
 
05:02:00.850 --> 05:02:00.860 align:start position:0%
implementing immigration policies
 
05:02:04.010 --> 05:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
promulgated by the state on behalf of
 
05:02:06.410 --> 05:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
the federal government and it's an
 
05:02:09.410 --> 05:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
abrogation of local control
 
05:02:11.750 --> 05:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that in this instant
 
05:02:14.690 --> 05:02:14.700 align:start position:0%
it makes our citizens who serve in local
 
05:02:17.990 --> 05:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
government at risk of Investigations and
 
05:02:20.690 --> 05:02:20.700 align:start position:0%
lawsuits over the very words they speak
 
05:02:24.350 --> 05:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
or the informal actions they take and if
 
05:02:26.690 --> 05:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
I know that the costs of those lawsuits
 
05:02:29.628 --> 05:02:29.638 align:start position:0%
will be borne by taxpayers would I not
 
05:02:31.730 --> 05:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
press the green button and support the
 
05:02:35.570 --> 05:02:35.580 align:start position:0%

parliamentary inquiry thank you Mr
Speaker

05:02:41.030 --> 05:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
Speaker
 
05:02:42.770 --> 05:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
if I know that our state needs to
 
05:02:44.390 --> 05:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
promote Law and Order when the federal
 
05:02:47.270 --> 05:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
government fails to do so and if I also
 
05:02:50.030 --> 05:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
realize that our towns and cities and
 
05:02:52.310 --> 05:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement agencies of those
 
05:02:55.070 --> 05:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities should never impede the
 
05:02:55.080 --> 05:02:56.410 align:start position:0%
municipalities should never impede the
apprehension

05:02:56.410 --> 05:02:56.420 align:start position:0%
apprehension
 
05:02:59.868 --> 05:02:59.878 align:start position:0%
of detained criminal aliens
 
05:03:02.990 --> 05:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
by immigration and custom enforcement by
 
05:03:05.330 --> 05:03:05.340 align:start position:0%
intentionally employing policies that do
 
05:03:08.208 --> 05:03:08.218 align:start position:0%
just that impede and finally and most
 
05:03:10.490 --> 05:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
importantly if I know that this issue
 
05:03:11.830 --> 05:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
has been
 
05:03:14.208 --> 05:03:14.218 align:start position:0%
misrepresented by many individuals and
 
05:03:16.910 --> 05:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
parties would I now press the red button
 
05:03:19.490 --> 05:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
so the floor debates on the amendment
 
05:03:22.550 --> 05:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
and the main motion can get a full
 
05:03:26.510 --> 05:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:29.270 --> 05:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
the question is whether lay sp-132 on
 
05:03:31.368 --> 05:03:31.378 align:start position:0%
the table and this is a roll call vote
 
05:03:33.110 --> 05:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
if you're in favor press the green
 
05:03:35.030 --> 05:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
button opposed press the red voting
 
05:03:54.890 --> 05:03:54.900 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker this is a Christmas
 
05:06:15.410 --> 05:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
tree bill for marijuana legalization
 
05:06:18.788 --> 05:06:18.798 align:start position:0%
that the house already passed
 
05:06:20.868 --> 05:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly so I'm asking that we put
 
05:06:22.550 --> 05:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
it on something that the Senate
 
05:06:24.590 --> 05:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly wants now that the
 
05:06:27.050 --> 05:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
coroner office has taken a slightly
 
05:06:29.448 --> 05:06:29.458 align:start position:0%
different position on marijuana maybe
 
05:06:31.788 --> 05:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
that will lead to the people on the
 
05:06:34.250 --> 05:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
other side also flip-flopping so I asked
 
05:06:35.930 --> 05:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
for your support it's legalized
 
05:06:39.830 --> 05:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:41.690 --> 05:06:41.700 align:start position:0%

05:06:53.030 --> 05:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
I rise in opposition to Amendment 1848
 
05:06:56.330 --> 05:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
as this is an attempt to keep a live
 
05:06:58.730 --> 05:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
language related to cannabis that the
 
05:07:01.010 --> 05:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
other body will never concur with and
 
05:07:03.170 --> 05:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
for that reason please vote no on
 
05:07:06.948 --> 05:07:06.958 align:start position:0%

05:09:09.050 --> 05:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker this is attaching
 
05:09:11.090 --> 05:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
another bill that the house passed this
 
05:09:13.430 --> 05:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
one related to our self-defense
 
05:09:15.948 --> 05:09:15.958 align:start position:0%
um so I ask that you support my
 
05:09:18.890 --> 05:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
amendment that repeals the prohibition
 
05:09:22.010 --> 05:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
on brass knuckles and blackjacks I think
 
05:09:24.110 --> 05:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
if we have a right to self-defense of
 
05:09:26.030 --> 05:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
lethal Force we also have the right to
 
05:09:28.070 --> 05:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
self-defense for non-lethal Force so I
 
05:09:29.030 --> 05:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
ask that you support our Second
 
05:09:30.830 --> 05:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment rights and support the
 
05:09:33.830 --> 05:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:35.750 --> 05:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative Muse is recognized to
 
05:09:46.970 --> 05:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:49.550 --> 05:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:09:51.890 --> 05:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
the amendment now before us would end
 
05:09:53.810 --> 05:09:53.820 align:start position:0%
our state's current prohibition on
 
05:09:55.490 --> 05:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
carrying or possessing with the intent
 
05:09:58.310 --> 05:09:58.320 align:start position:0%

05:10:00.650 --> 05:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
slung shots
 
05:10:00.660 --> 05:10:01.310 align:start position:0%
slung shots
um

05:10:01.310 --> 05:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:03.470 --> 05:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
we've been here before
 
05:10:05.690 --> 05:10:05.700 align:start position:0%
and I know that there are always things
 
05:10:07.550 --> 05:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
that we can do to try to make a good
 
05:10:10.128 --> 05:10:10.138 align:start position:0%
bill and even better build
 
05:10:13.128 --> 05:10:13.138 align:start position:0%
but passing this amendment is not one of
 
05:10:13.138 --> 05:10:14.830 align:start position:0%
but passing this amendment is not one of
them

05:10:14.830 --> 05:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:10:18.590 --> 05:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
this particular amendment has been
 
05:10:20.270 --> 05:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
opposed by the New Hampshire State
 
05:10:22.510 --> 05:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
Police as well as by the New Hampshire
 
05:10:25.490 --> 05:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
Chiefs of Police Association and it's
 
05:10:28.070 --> 05:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
being opposed for a very good reason
 
05:10:30.890 --> 05:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
if this policy were put into place it
 
05:10:33.350 --> 05:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
not only would jeopardize the safety of
 
05:10:35.330 --> 05:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
Law Enforcement Officers it would also
 
05:10:37.910 --> 05:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
jeopardize the safety of the students in
 
05:10:39.230 --> 05:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
our schools
 
05:10:42.530 --> 05:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
anyone who goes into a bar or any type
 
05:10:44.750 --> 05:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
of public accommodation and basically
 
05:10:47.330 --> 05:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
any person walking down the street
 
05:10:50.090 --> 05:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
so please please join with our law
 
05:10:52.550 --> 05:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement community in opposing this
 
05:10:56.150 --> 05:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and harmful change to a very
 
05:10:58.250 --> 05:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
very good bill that really does deserve
 
05:11:01.368 --> 05:11:01.378 align:start position:0%
to pass thank you
 
05:11:03.830 --> 05:11:03.840 align:start position:0%

05:12:58.788 --> 05:12:58.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:13:01.010 --> 05:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
the committee amendment that we just
 
05:13:04.490 --> 05:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
adopted implemented eight of the nine
 
05:13:06.410 --> 05:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
changes that our committee wanted to
 
05:13:09.050 --> 05:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
make to the Senate bill 54.
 
05:13:11.930 --> 05:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
the ninth change got lost somewhere
 
05:13:16.070 --> 05:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
between our committee room and OLS
 
05:13:19.910 --> 05:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
so this floor Amendment implements that
 
05:13:22.250 --> 05:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
ninth change
 
05:13:27.470 --> 05:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
if you look on page 27 of your calendar
 
05:13:29.510 --> 05:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
down near the bottom of the page you'll
 
05:13:32.030 --> 05:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
see a definition for new electric energy
 
05:13:32.040 --> 05:13:35.330 align:start position:0%
see a definition for new electric energy
sources

05:13:35.330 --> 05:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:37.730 --> 05:13:37.740 align:start position:0%
and you'll note that at the end of that
 
05:13:40.550 --> 05:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
sentence is the phrase at a site where
 
05:13:44.270 --> 05:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
no facility previously existed
 
05:13:46.910 --> 05:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
then if you turn the page to page 28 and
 
05:13:49.070 --> 05:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
you look at the floor Amendment
 
05:13:51.708 --> 05:13:51.718 align:start position:0%
you'll discover that that phrase has
 
05:13:53.510 --> 05:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
been eliminated
 
05:13:55.910 --> 05:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
from that sentence
 
05:13:58.368 --> 05:13:58.378 align:start position:0%
that's important because
 
05:14:00.410 --> 05:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 54
 
05:14:04.490 --> 05:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
allows utilities to implement purchase
 
05:14:07.670 --> 05:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
power agreements with newly constructed
 
05:14:12.230 --> 05:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:14.930 --> 05:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
but without this amendment it would
 
05:14:14.940 --> 05:14:16.788 align:start position:0%
but without this amendment it would
prohibit

05:14:16.788 --> 05:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
prohibit
 
05:14:20.030 --> 05:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
an injury Source that's built on a site
 
05:14:22.610 --> 05:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
of an existing energy source
 
05:14:25.010 --> 05:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
to be considered
 
05:14:27.410 --> 05:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
so for example the Merrimack station
 
05:14:30.948 --> 05:14:30.958 align:start position:0%
coal plant and bow if that was torn down
 
05:14:33.708 --> 05:14:33.718 align:start position:0%
and replaced with a solar facility that
 
05:14:36.170 --> 05:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
solar facility wouldn't be eligible
 
05:14:39.230 --> 05:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
to participate in these ppas under
 
05:14:42.110 --> 05:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 54 unless this phrase is
 
05:14:42.120 --> 05:14:43.250 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 54 unless this phrase is
removed

05:14:43.250 --> 05:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
removed
 
05:14:45.590 --> 05:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
therefore we ask you to pass this floor
 
05:14:48.230 --> 05:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment and then pass Senate Bill 54.
 
05:14:51.170 --> 05:14:51.180 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair I rise today in
 
05:21:55.610 --> 05:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
opposition to the ought to pass motion
 
05:21:58.910 --> 05:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
on its Senate bill 118. this bill would
 
05:22:01.070 --> 05:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
change our current car seat law which
 
05:22:02.930 --> 05:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
requires children under the age of seven
 
05:22:04.788 --> 05:22:04.798 align:start position:0%
and under the height of four feet nine
 
05:22:06.470 --> 05:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
inches to be restrained in a motor
 
05:22:08.810 --> 05:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
vehicle and when add the requirement
 
05:22:11.090 --> 05:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
that under the age of two they would be
 
05:22:13.550 --> 05:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
rear-facing regardless of their size the
 
05:22:15.948 --> 05:22:15.958 align:start position:0%
weight or the manufacturer requirements
 
05:22:17.208 --> 05:22:17.218 align:start position:0%
of the seat
 
05:22:19.490 --> 05:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
proponents of this bill believe that
 
05:22:21.650 --> 05:22:21.660 align:start position:0%
children under two being in a rare
 
05:22:24.650 --> 05:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
rear-facing car seat is an easy way to
 
05:22:26.390 --> 05:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
increase child safety but they don't
 
05:22:29.090 --> 05:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
realize the unintended consequences
 
05:22:32.090 --> 05:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
the two biggest problems here are that
 
05:22:34.070 --> 05:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
this law will tell parents that when
 
05:22:36.470 --> 05:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
their child turns two it's time to turn
 
05:22:38.990 --> 05:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
them forward-facing and there's also the
 
05:22:41.930 --> 05:22:41.940 align:start position:0%
problem of car seats that will not fit
 
05:22:43.670 --> 05:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
into the vehicle
 
05:22:46.010 --> 05:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
so car seats have changed a lot since
 
05:22:48.170 --> 05:22:48.180 align:start position:0%
many of you have had car seats and
 
05:22:49.670 --> 05:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
they've changed in the 11 years that
 
05:22:50.990 --> 05:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
I've been in the market
 
05:22:53.448 --> 05:22:53.458 align:start position:0%
they're a lot easier to install and as
 
05:22:55.190 --> 05:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
the move towards extended rear-facing
 
05:22:57.230 --> 05:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
happens they're getting bigger and
 
05:23:00.050 --> 05:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
bigger it's great for safety but it's
 
05:23:02.570 --> 05:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
not so good for families with small cars
 
05:23:06.050 --> 05:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
I have a giant sequoia SUV and a midsize
 
05:23:08.810 --> 05:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
sedan with my third car child it was
 
05:23:10.850 --> 05:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
very very hard to find an infant car
 
05:23:12.770 --> 05:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
seat that would fit in the sedan with
 
05:23:14.868 --> 05:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
all five members of the family
 
05:23:18.350 --> 05:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
it was absolutely impossible to find a
 
05:23:20.868 --> 05:23:20.878 align:start position:0%
larger rear-facing seat onesie sized out
 
05:23:22.910 --> 05:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
of the baby seat that would allow us all
 
05:23:25.128 --> 05:23:25.138 align:start position:0%
to sit in the car that meant we took two
 
05:23:28.128 --> 05:23:28.138 align:start position:0%
cars for some families that means you
 
05:23:30.530 --> 05:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
need to buy a second vehicle or buy a
 
05:23:32.990 --> 05:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
new vehicle because you can't all fit in
 
05:23:34.788 --> 05:23:34.798 align:start position:0%
the car
 
05:23:36.770 --> 05:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
so while there's organizations that will
 
05:23:38.570 --> 05:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
provide a rear-facing car seat for
 
05:23:40.550 --> 05:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
families there's no organizations that
 
05:23:43.670 --> 05:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
help you get a new car if you don't fit
 
05:23:46.190 --> 05:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
so the biggest problem here is saying
 
05:23:47.990 --> 05:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
that the age at age two you can turn
 
05:23:50.030 --> 05:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
your child forward-facing
 
05:23:51.948 --> 05:23:51.958 align:start position:0%
last session we saw a bill like this
 
05:23:53.930 --> 05:23:53.940 align:start position:0%
that turned into a study committee
 
05:23:55.788 --> 05:23:55.798 align:start position:0%
I was on that committee along with the
 
05:23:57.948 --> 05:23:57.958 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of this bill we had a lot
 
05:23:59.750 --> 05:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
of experts that came in and testified to
 
05:24:01.730 --> 05:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
us and you might be surprised to know
 
05:24:04.490 --> 05:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
but each one of you would be safer if
 
05:24:06.890 --> 05:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
you were riding in a car we are facing
 
05:24:08.930 --> 05:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
every single one of you would be safer
 
05:24:10.850 --> 05:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
except the driver wouldn't be able to
 
05:24:12.970 --> 05:24:12.980 align:start position:0%
see the road
 
05:24:15.948 --> 05:24:15.958 align:start position:0%
so as we look at this we also had
 
05:24:18.410 --> 05:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
documentation of what happens in car
 
05:24:20.270 --> 05:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
accidents in New Hampshire especially
 
05:24:22.510 --> 05:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
with children under age too
 
05:24:26.690 --> 05:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
96 percent of Granite State children in
 
05:24:28.730 --> 05:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
the last two years involved in traffic
 
05:24:31.490 --> 05:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
accidents were in rear-facing car seats
 
05:24:34.010 --> 05:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
that means four percent weren't
 
05:24:35.810 --> 05:24:35.820 align:start position:0%
following what would be law
 
05:24:38.030 --> 05:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
the state police testified that they're
 
05:24:40.430 --> 05:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
doing a great job when they get seven
 
05:24:43.490 --> 05:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
percent compliance so this is quite
 
05:24:45.890 --> 05:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
honestly not necessary and even worse
 
05:24:48.230 --> 05:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's harmful right now if you ask your
 
05:24:50.330 --> 05:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
pediatrician how long to keep your child
 
05:24:53.690 --> 05:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
rear-facing the answer is as long as you
 
05:24:55.970 --> 05:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
can having three and four-year-olds
 
05:24:58.368 --> 05:24:58.378 align:start position:0%
rear-facing is safest and if you can do
 
05:25:01.128 --> 05:25:01.138 align:start position:0%
it you should
 
05:25:02.750 --> 05:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
the problem is
 
05:25:05.090 --> 05:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
you hit your second birthday you turn
 
05:25:07.310 --> 05:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
forward facing and you lose that safety
 
05:25:09.170 --> 05:25:09.180 align:start position:0%
on those three and four-year-olds that
 
05:25:10.970 --> 05:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
otherwise would stay in a rear-facing
 
05:25:13.850 --> 05:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
seat we do actually have some junior
 
05:25:15.650 --> 05:25:15.660 align:start position:0%
members here in the infant car seats
 
05:25:17.030 --> 05:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
because some people will tell you that
 
05:25:18.350 --> 05:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
you come home from the hospital we're
 
05:25:20.990 --> 05:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
facing I can pretty much guarantee you
 
05:25:23.030 --> 05:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
that a year from now neither of them
 
05:25:25.310 --> 05:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
will fit into those infant seats and
 
05:25:26.390 --> 05:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
they may need to purchase another
 
05:25:28.310 --> 05:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
rear-facing seat by then
 
05:25:29.750 --> 05:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of unintended
 
05:25:31.850 --> 05:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
consequences and parents are already
 
05:25:33.470 --> 05:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
keeping their children rear-facing if
 
05:25:36.170 --> 05:25:36.180 align:start position:0%
they can this is unnecessary potentially
 
05:25:38.930 --> 05:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
harmful and I ask for you to overturn
 
05:25:40.730 --> 05:25:40.740 align:start position:0%
this motion so that a better motion can
 
05:25:43.190 --> 05:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
be made thank you with a member yield
 
05:25:44.570 --> 05:25:44.580 align:start position:0%

05:25:50.150 --> 05:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:51.948 --> 05:25:51.958 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker I feel much more
 
05:25:56.030 --> 05:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:58.550 --> 05:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
I've heard the most most parents who go
 
05:26:01.190 --> 05:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
to these uh these Cosi check stations uh
 
05:26:03.830 --> 05:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
or things with the the fire department
 
05:26:05.990 --> 05:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
and the police have their car seats
 
05:26:08.470 --> 05:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
installed backwards or wrong or whatever
 
05:26:12.170 --> 05:26:12.180 align:start position:0%
how can we possibly expect to trust
 
05:26:16.310 --> 05:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:18.530 --> 05:26:18.540 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
 
05:26:20.448 --> 05:26:20.458 align:start position:0%
um there actually was a testimony in
 
05:26:22.128 --> 05:26:22.138 align:start position:0%
committee that over 90 percent of people
 
05:26:24.948 --> 05:26:24.958 align:start position:0%
at the car check stations did not have
 
05:26:27.110 --> 05:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
them installed correctly but that's
 
05:26:29.150 --> 05:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
because most people can figure it out
 
05:26:30.650 --> 05:26:30.660 align:start position:0%
and if you don't there are lots of
 
05:26:32.448 --> 05:26:32.458 align:start position:0%
advertised places for car seat
 
05:26:34.128 --> 05:26:34.138 align:start position:0%
Specialists to help you make sure it's
 
05:26:34.138 --> 05:26:34.910 align:start position:0%
Specialists to help you make sure it's
right

05:26:34.910 --> 05:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:26:36.590 --> 05:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
we should applaud these parents they had
 
05:26:38.330 --> 05:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
a question they got it fixed and now
 
05:26:40.010 --> 05:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
their kids are safe and that's not
 
05:26:42.170 --> 05:26:42.180 align:start position:0%
really a good data point
 
05:26:43.788 --> 05:26:43.798 align:start position:0%
with the member yield for a second
 
05:26:49.788 --> 05:26:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:52.610 --> 05:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question is it
 
05:26:55.970 --> 05:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
not true that young children have weaker
 
05:27:00.110 --> 05:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
necks much bigger heads and skulls that
 
05:27:04.910 --> 05:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:07.610 --> 05:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes a
 
05:27:10.730 --> 05:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
newborn's head is 25 of its weight and
 
05:27:13.070 --> 05:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
for us it's six percent of our weight
 
05:27:16.550 --> 05:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
and children's necks don't are hyper
 
05:27:18.050 --> 05:27:18.060 align:start position:0%
mobile all the way through their teens
 
05:27:20.208 --> 05:27:20.218 align:start position:0%
you don't even close all of your skull
 
05:27:22.430 --> 05:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
Searchers until you reach your 20s
 
05:27:24.350 --> 05:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
that's a good reason why we should keep
 
05:27:26.628 --> 05:27:26.638 align:start position:0%
the law the way it is which encourages
 
05:27:27.890 --> 05:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
parents to keep their children
 
05:27:30.170 --> 05:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
rear-facing as long as possible instead
 
05:27:31.490 --> 05:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
of telling them that it's safe to turn
 
05:27:34.010 --> 05:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
them forward facing at two years
 
05:27:35.810 --> 05:27:35.820 align:start position:0%
with a member yield for a third question
 
05:27:40.310 --> 05:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:42.890 --> 05:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:27:46.070 --> 05:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
um I have spoken to parents and I'm
 
05:27:47.810 --> 05:27:47.820 align:start position:0%
wondering if in this bill there's any
 
05:27:50.150 --> 05:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
exception for extenuating circumstances
 
05:27:53.510 --> 05:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
I had a mom who had a torn esophagus and
 
05:27:55.250 --> 05:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
for her maneuvering
 
05:27:57.288 --> 05:27:57.298 align:start position:0%
um to she couldn't physically pull her
 
05:27:59.270 --> 05:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
child out from the rear-facing position
 
05:28:02.110 --> 05:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
because the setup of her car in the seat
 
05:28:04.368 --> 05:28:04.378 align:start position:0%
in this situation would there be any
 
05:28:05.868 --> 05:28:05.878 align:start position:0%
exception for her she turned the seat
 
05:28:08.208 --> 05:28:08.218 align:start position:0%
around temporarily until her esophagus
 
05:28:09.530 --> 05:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
healed and then
 
05:28:11.390 --> 05:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
um put it back where you're facing is
 
05:28:12.830 --> 05:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
there any exception for something like
 
05:28:12.840 --> 05:28:15.948 align:start position:0%
there any exception for something like
that

05:28:15.948 --> 05:28:15.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:17.570 --> 05:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question there is
 
05:28:19.190 --> 05:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
no exception for that or any other
 
05:28:19.200 --> 05:28:20.448 align:start position:0%
no exception for that or any other
reason

05:28:20.448 --> 05:28:20.458 align:start position:0%
reason
 
05:28:22.128 --> 05:28:22.138 align:start position:0%
would the member yield for a fourth
 
05:28:24.830 --> 05:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
question the member yields this will be
 
05:28:27.948 --> 05:28:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:29.448 --> 05:28:29.458 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:28:32.150 --> 05:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
if we pass this bill how will we compare
 
05:28:36.128 --> 05:28:36.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:38.690 --> 05:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question my
 
05:28:41.230 --> 05:28:41.240 align:start position:0%
data is from last year's study committee
 
05:28:44.330 --> 05:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
last year we were one of 30 States that
 
05:28:47.090 --> 05:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
had no law on rear-facing there was
 
05:28:50.690 --> 05:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
there are two states
 
05:28:53.090 --> 05:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
sorry there's nine states that require
 
05:28:56.330 --> 05:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
children under one to be rear-facing but
 
05:28:58.190 --> 05:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
eight of those allow a certain if
 
05:28:59.690 --> 05:28:59.700 align:start position:0%
they're over 20 pounds to move to
 
05:29:03.230 --> 05:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
forward facing there are 13 states that
 
05:29:05.208 --> 05:29:05.218 align:start position:0%
require children under two to be
 
05:29:07.490 --> 05:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
rear-facing but if they're too tall too
 
05:29:09.770 --> 05:29:09.780 align:start position:0%
heavy or they're outside manufacturer
 
05:29:11.570 --> 05:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
guidelines then they can move forward
 
05:29:13.970 --> 05:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
facing if we pass this will be one of
 
05:29:15.948 --> 05:29:15.958 align:start position:0%
five states even more restrictive than
 
05:29:17.930 --> 05:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
California that don't even have a weight
 
05:29:20.330 --> 05:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
limit or a height limit I think we
 
05:29:21.708 --> 05:29:21.718 align:start position:0%
should trust to The Experts that say
 
05:29:23.570 --> 05:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
rear face as long as possible and Trust
 
05:29:26.690 --> 05:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
the parents and vote this down thank you
 
05:29:28.850 --> 05:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative

thank you madam speaker Madam speaker I
 
05:29:37.730 --> 05:29:37.740 align:start position:0%
rise today in support of the house
 
05:29:39.708 --> 05:29:39.718 align:start position:0%
Transportation majority recommendation
 
05:29:43.190 --> 05:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
of ought to pass for SB 118. SB 118
 
05:29:44.990 --> 05:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
calls for children under the age of two
 
05:29:46.430 --> 05:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
years old to be restrained in a
 
05:29:48.350 --> 05:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
rear-facing child car seat in motor
 
05:29:50.390 --> 05:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle the bill seeks to keep children
 
05:29:52.070 --> 05:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
under the age of two-year-olds safer
 
05:29:53.690 --> 05:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
when traveling in a vehicle in the event
 
05:29:55.250 --> 05:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
of a collision
 
05:29:56.868 --> 05:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
it includes an exception for children
 
05:29:58.430 --> 05:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
under age two who exceed the relevant
 
05:30:00.050 --> 05:30:00.060 align:start position:0%
wait minimums
 
05:30:02.208 --> 05:30:02.218 align:start position:0%
if you've left the hospital as a parent
 
05:30:04.490 --> 05:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
with the newborn in recent years you may
 
05:30:06.470 --> 05:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
remember Hospital staff ensuring that
 
05:30:08.810 --> 05:30:08.820 align:start position:0%
you had safely secured your baby in a
 
05:30:10.788 --> 05:30:10.798 align:start position:0%
rear-facing seat before allowing you to
 
05:30:11.930 --> 05:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
drive home
 
05:30:13.550 --> 05:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
that's because the medical and
 
05:30:15.470 --> 05:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
scientific Community consensus is clear
 
05:30:17.930 --> 05:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
the mechanical engineering and physics
 
05:30:20.510 --> 05:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
of rear-facing car seats make it Far and
 
05:30:23.150 --> 05:30:23.160 align:start position:0%

children ages zero to two
 
05:30:28.910 --> 05:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
rear-facing car seats ensure adequate

time for children to develop and using
 
05:30:33.050 --> 05:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
the correct car seat can reduce injuries
 
05:30:34.490 --> 05:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
and death
 
05:30:36.530 --> 05:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
a newborn's head makes up about 25
 
05:30:38.750 --> 05:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
percent of its body weight
 
05:30:41.090 --> 05:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
the younger a child is the less form the

neck muscles
 
05:30:44.090 --> 05:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
most accidents are forward moving
 
05:30:46.368 --> 05:30:46.378 align:start position:0%

those experienced by an adult but the
 
05:31:01.128 --> 05:31:01.138 align:start position:0%
functional impact can be very different

the cognitive impairments of a child
 
05:31:04.670 --> 05:31:04.680 align:start position:0%

concerned with these safety issues
 
05:31:29.750 --> 05:31:29.760 align:start position:0%

overlap with existing laws in New
 
05:31:42.470 --> 05:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dozens of experts legislators

and citizens including parents have
 
05:31:45.830 --> 05:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
expressed their support for this bill in
 
05:31:47.868 --> 05:31:47.878 align:start position:0%
hearings not a single group or
 
05:31:49.610 --> 05:31:49.620 align:start position:0%

of this bill
 
05:31:53.510 --> 05:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
rear-facing car seats are not more
 
05:31:55.250 --> 05:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
expensive than front-facing car seats
 
05:31:56.868 --> 05:31:56.878 align:start position:0%
which are already required by law for

this age group in fact convertible car
 
05:32:01.310 --> 05:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
seats can be cost Savers because they
 
05:32:02.570 --> 05:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
can face backwards for the first two
 
05:32:04.010 --> 05:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
years and then be face forward to
 
05:32:05.570 --> 05:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
accommodate a larger weight and age
 
05:32:08.030 --> 05:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
range thus lasting longer in addition
 
05:32:09.350 --> 05:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth health is committed to
 
05:32:11.330 --> 05:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
providing rear-facing car seats for

thank you madam speaker
 
05:39:13.010 --> 05:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
I stand in opposition to SB 256.
 
05:39:14.930 --> 05:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
now Madam speaker
 
05:39:17.448 --> 05:39:17.458 align:start position:0%
when I think about this bill
 
05:39:19.670 --> 05:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
it reminds me of the National Football
 
05:39:19.680 --> 05:39:21.230 align:start position:0%
it reminds me of the National Football
League

05:39:21.230 --> 05:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
League
 
05:39:23.810 --> 05:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
and you may ask how does it relate to
 
05:39:26.270 --> 05:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
that well many years ago the National
 
05:39:29.930 --> 05:39:29.940 align:start position:0%
Football League also stood for the no
 
05:39:31.368 --> 05:39:31.378 align:start position:0%
fund League
 
05:39:34.310 --> 05:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
and when I think of this bill I look at
 
05:39:37.490 --> 05:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
it as the no fund bill
 
05:39:41.330 --> 05:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
now why the NFL was cracking down was it
 
05:39:43.610 --> 05:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
we're cracking down on celebrations in
 
05:39:45.288 --> 05:39:45.298 align:start position:0%
terms of having fun
 
05:39:48.830 --> 05:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
and this is exactly what this bill does
 
05:39:52.490 --> 05:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
this bill legislates fun
 
05:39:54.530 --> 05:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
now how does it do it well we're talking
 
05:39:56.868 --> 05:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
about off Highway
 
05:39:59.150 --> 05:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
recreational vehicles
 
05:40:01.310 --> 05:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
so you may be asking yourself well what
 
05:40:04.610 --> 05:40:04.620 align:start position:0%
is an off Highway recreational vehicle
 
05:40:07.310 --> 05:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
well according to the definition
 
05:40:09.770 --> 05:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
it is used in a public way for a
 
05:40:13.430 --> 05:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
pleasure or recreational purposes
 
05:40:16.368 --> 05:40:16.378 align:start position:0%
it runs on rubber tires tracks or
 
05:40:18.650 --> 05:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
cushion of air
 
05:40:20.510 --> 05:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
it depends on the ground or other
 
05:40:22.310 --> 05:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
surface for travel
 
05:40:25.430 --> 05:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
and lastly has an operator
 
05:40:28.128 --> 05:40:28.138 align:start position:0%
who sits on the vehicle
 
05:40:31.490 --> 05:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
now Madam speaker if this bill passes
 
05:40:33.650 --> 05:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
one of the things it requires is that
 
05:40:36.530 --> 05:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
all various individuals will need to
 
05:40:40.128 --> 05:40:40.138 align:start position:0%
attend five hours of training
 
05:40:43.070 --> 05:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
to from these vehicles
 
05:40:47.208 --> 05:40:47.218 align:start position:0%
talk about legislation of fun
 
05:40:50.150 --> 05:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
George Bernard shura once said we don't
 
05:40:54.050 --> 05:40:54.060 align:start position:0%

05:40:57.350 --> 05:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
old because we stop playing
 
05:41:00.948 --> 05:41:00.958 align:start position:0%
if this law passes it could also have a
 
05:41:03.250 --> 05:41:03.260 align:start position:0%
negative impact to our New Hampshire
 
05:41:06.350 --> 05:41:06.360 align:start position:0%

05:41:52.550 --> 05:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
all utility terrain vehicles or utvs
 
05:41:55.910 --> 05:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
side by sides and Gators
 
05:41:58.128 --> 05:41:58.138 align:start position:0%
this program will only apply to
 
05:42:01.970 --> 05:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
recreational uses of ohrvs operators who
 
05:42:03.708 --> 05:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
work on farms or on construction sites
 
05:42:06.590 --> 05:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
will be exempt from this program
 
05:42:08.810 --> 05:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
this bill has been referred to as the no
 
05:42:10.490 --> 05:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
fund bill
 
05:42:12.530 --> 05:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
I like to refer to it as the fund
 
05:42:14.750 --> 05:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
preservation bill
 
05:42:18.708 --> 05:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:20.150 --> 05:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
there'll be two levels of certification
 
05:42:22.010 --> 05:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
the temporary certificate issued for
 
05:42:23.810 --> 05:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to rent
 
05:42:26.990 --> 05:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
an ohrv on a temporary basis
 
05:42:29.868 --> 05:42:29.878 align:start position:0%
and a lifetime certification which may
 
05:42:31.610 --> 05:42:31.620 align:start position:0%
be issued after completion of a more
 
05:42:34.030 --> 05:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
in-depth training course
 
05:42:36.470 --> 05:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
ohrvs have become extremely popular in
 
05:42:37.788 --> 05:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire especially in the North
 
05:42:39.708 --> 05:42:39.718 align:start position:0%
country where they have become an
 
05:42:41.150 --> 05:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
important part of the local economy
 
05:42:44.090 --> 05:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
contributing an estimated 300 million
 
05:42:44.100 --> 05:42:45.288 align:start position:0%
contributing an estimated 300 million
dollars

05:42:45.288 --> 05:42:45.298 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:42:48.830 --> 05:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
and nearly 2 500 jobs in 2020 alone
 
05:42:51.110 --> 05:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
while ohrvs are primarily operated
 
05:42:53.570 --> 05:42:53.580 align:start position:0%
off-road and established Trails they are
 
05:42:55.310 --> 05:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
increasingly allowed on State and local
 
05:42:57.590 --> 05:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
roadways giving Riders access to gas
 
05:43:00.288 --> 05:43:00.298 align:start position:0%
stations restaurants lodging and other
 
05:43:02.570 --> 05:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
amenities where they support local
 
05:43:04.850 --> 05:43:04.860 align:start position:0%
businesses the proposed safety
 
05:43:06.288 --> 05:43:06.298 align:start position:0%
certification program seeks to address
 
05:43:08.090 --> 05:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
some major areas of concern that have
 
05:43:10.310 --> 05:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
Arisen as the sports popularity as has
 
05:43:12.650 --> 05:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
grown firstly many of the trails these
 
05:43:14.810 --> 05:43:14.820 align:start position:0%
vehicles use Traverse private property
 
05:43:16.910 --> 05:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
with the permission of landowners as
 
05:43:18.410 --> 05:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
more operators take advantage of the
 
05:43:18.420 --> 05:43:19.670 align:start position:0%
more operators take advantage of the
sport

05:43:19.670 --> 05:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
sport
 
05:43:21.948 --> 05:43:21.958 align:start position:0%
cases have increased where Riders have
 
05:43:23.510 --> 05:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
deviated from the established Trails
 
05:43:25.550 --> 05:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
trespassed on private land and caused
 
05:43:28.250 --> 05:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
significant property damage to Farms
 
05:43:31.670 --> 05:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
woodlands and wetlands consequently many
 
05:43:33.650 --> 05:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
landowners have become hesitant to allow
 
05:43:36.350 --> 05:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
access to Trails which poses a threat to
 
05:43:38.390 --> 05:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
the sport and local economies that have
 
05:43:40.490 --> 05:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
become to rely on it
 
05:43:42.350 --> 05:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive safety certification
 
05:43:44.150 --> 05:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
program aims to represerve good
 
05:43:45.708 --> 05:43:45.718 align:start position:0%
relationships with landowners by
 
05:43:47.330 --> 05:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
informing operators about these concerns
 
05:43:48.650 --> 05:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
and educating them on responsible
 
05:43:50.390 --> 05:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
ridership and the importance of
 
05:43:52.670 --> 05:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
following proper Trail etiquette
 
05:43:54.770 --> 05:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
secondly ohrvs
 
05:43:57.530 --> 05:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
as whicheveries some of which are as big
 
05:43:59.930 --> 05:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
and powerful as cars are increasingly
 
05:44:01.610 --> 05:44:01.620 align:start position:0%
allowed to operate on state state and
 
05:44:03.830 --> 05:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
local highways safety training will also
 
05:44:07.910 --> 05:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
also focus on participant
 
05:44:10.788 --> 05:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
one second we'll also focus on educating
 
05:44:13.090 --> 05:44:13.100 align:start position:0%
participants about the rules of the road
 
05:44:15.350 --> 05:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
participants will be taught the specific
 
05:44:17.150 --> 05:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
laws and regulations governing the use
 
05:44:19.430 --> 05:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
of ohrvs on public roads ensuring they
 
05:44:20.570 --> 05:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
understand their rights and
 
05:44:22.910 --> 05:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities as operators they will
 
05:44:24.830 --> 05:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
learn about speed limits
 
05:44:27.470 --> 05:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
traffic signs signaling reducing excess
 
05:44:28.490 --> 05:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
noise as they drive through
 
05:44:30.708 --> 05:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and other crucial aspects
 
05:44:33.170 --> 05:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
of safe courteous operation additionally
 
05:44:34.670 --> 05:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
participants will receive guidance on
 
05:44:35.868 --> 05:44:35.878 align:start position:0%
sharing the road with other vehicles
 
05:44:37.970 --> 05:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
following proper lane discipline and
 
05:44:40.128 --> 05:44:40.138 align:start position:0%
practicing Defensive Driving techniques
 
05:44:43.070 --> 05:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
lastly ohrb safety training will cover
 
05:44:45.288 --> 05:44:45.298 align:start position:0%
the physical risk and limitations of
 
05:44:46.910 --> 05:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
these vehicles when operating on paved
 
05:44:46.920 --> 05:44:48.530 align:start position:0%
these vehicles when operating on paved
roadways

05:44:48.530 --> 05:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
roadways
 
05:44:50.750 --> 05:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
these can include things that people who
 
05:44:52.368 --> 05:44:52.378 align:start position:0%
have been writing for their entire lives
 
05:44:54.110 --> 05:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
may not be aware of participants will
 
05:44:55.430 --> 05:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
learn about the unique characteristics
 
05:44:58.250 --> 05:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
of ohrvs such as their size weight and
 
05:44:59.990 --> 05:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
handling capabilities and how these
 
05:45:01.850 --> 05:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
factors affect their operational paved
 
05:45:04.250 --> 05:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
roadways versus dirt trails tires
 
05:45:05.628 --> 05:45:05.638 align:start position:0%
designed for off-road conditions May
 
05:45:07.190 --> 05:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
perform very differently on paved
 
05:45:09.350 --> 05:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
roadways affecting steering acceleration
 
05:45:11.208 --> 05:45:11.218 align:start position:0%
and braking distances operators will be
 
05:45:13.128 --> 05:45:13.138 align:start position:0%
educated about the importance of
 
05:45:14.390 --> 05:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
understanding turning radius and
 
05:45:16.750 --> 05:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
maneuvering limitations specific to HR
 
05:45:19.310 --> 05:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
ohrvs by understanding the physical
 
05:45:21.770 --> 05:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
risks and limitations of their vehicles
 
05:45:23.510 --> 05:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
participants can make informed decisions
 
05:45:25.490 --> 05:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
while operating on roadways adjusting
 
05:45:26.990 --> 05:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
their driving behavior
 
05:45:28.910 --> 05:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
to ensure their safety and the safety of
 
05:45:28.920 --> 05:45:31.368 align:start position:0%
to ensure their safety and the safety of
others

05:45:31.368 --> 05:45:31.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:33.530 --> 05:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
or they will risk losing their their
 
05:45:33.540 --> 05:45:35.448 align:start position:0%
or they will risk losing their their
certificate

05:45:35.448 --> 05:45:35.458 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
05:45:37.010 --> 05:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
as they would their driver's license
 
05:45:39.048 --> 05:45:39.058 align:start position:0%
this knowledge empowers participants
 
05:45:40.670 --> 05:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
even those who have been may have been
 
05:45:42.048 --> 05:45:42.058 align:start position:0%
operating for decades to make
 
05:45:43.670 --> 05:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
responsible choices in Adaptive Driving
 
05:45:45.530 --> 05:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
style according to the capabilities and
 
05:45:48.948 --> 05:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
limitations of their ohrvs reducing the
 
05:45:50.208 --> 05:45:50.218 align:start position:0%
risk of damage to private property
 
05:45:52.070 --> 05:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
preventing accidents and promoting safer
 
05:45:55.430 --> 05:45:55.440 align:start position:0%

05:47:03.110 --> 05:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
the house will come to order the chair
 
05:47:05.208 --> 05:47:05.218 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative gorsky for a
 
05:47:09.410 --> 05:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:11.990 --> 05:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker
 
05:47:14.208 --> 05:47:14.218 align:start position:0%
if I know that this bill will require
 
05:47:17.208 --> 05:47:17.218 align:start position:0%
five-hour training course for many of
 
05:47:19.368 --> 05:47:19.378 align:start position:0%
our constituents who want to write an
 
05:47:19.378 --> 05:47:21.590 align:start position:0%
our constituents who want to write an
ohrv

05:47:21.590 --> 05:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
ohrv
 
05:47:24.410 --> 05:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill this no
 
05:47:26.750 --> 05:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
fund bill could have a negative impact
 
05:47:28.850 --> 05:47:28.860 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire's recreational industry
 
05:47:32.390 --> 05:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
would I then in the interest of fund
 
05:47:34.430 --> 05:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
press the red button so a more
 
05:47:37.610 --> 05:47:37.620 align:start position:0%
appropriate motion can be made
 
05:47:39.350 --> 05:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
05:47:47.810 --> 05:47:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:49.670 --> 05:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker
 
05:47:51.410 --> 05:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
Madam speaker
 
05:47:54.470 --> 05:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
if I know that this is a bill
 
05:47:56.090 --> 05:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
so I'm having
 
05:47:59.030 --> 05:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
a new eyeglass issues I apologize about
 
05:48:01.610 --> 05:48:01.620 align:start position:0%
that if I know that the popularity of
 
05:48:04.490 --> 05:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
ohrvs has surged in New Hampshire
 
05:48:07.010 --> 05:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
particularly in the North country where
 
05:48:09.830 --> 05:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
it has become one of the Mainstays of
 
05:48:11.270 --> 05:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
its economy
 
05:48:14.570 --> 05:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that ohrvs
 
05:48:17.090 --> 05:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
are powerful motor vehicles that are
 
05:48:19.850 --> 05:48:19.860 align:start position:0%
primarily operated off-road but also do
 
05:48:22.368 --> 05:48:22.378 align:start position:0%
operate on established roads
 
05:48:25.310 --> 05:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
and one way to help improve the
 
05:48:28.368 --> 05:48:28.378 align:start position:0%
maintenance and preservation of trails
 
05:48:30.470 --> 05:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
is to have people who are trained
 
05:48:33.650 --> 05:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
on how to operate those Vehicles keeping
 
05:48:36.230 --> 05:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
more private land available for trails
 
05:48:40.128 --> 05:48:40.138 align:start position:0%
and finally and most importantly that
 
05:48:44.170 --> 05:48:44.180 align:start position:0%
if I know ohrvs are due in fact

thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:54:19.970 --> 05:54:19.980 align:start position:0%
as everybody in Edna and maybe one or
 
05:54:23.448 --> 05:54:23.458 align:start position:0%
two others know as well this year we
 
05:54:25.850 --> 05:54:25.860 align:start position:0%
completely re-codified the statute
 
05:54:28.548 --> 05:54:28.558 align:start position:0%
governing the office of professional
 
05:54:32.030 --> 05:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification we took took
 
05:54:34.548 --> 05:54:34.558 align:start position:0%
it out of one RSA and moved it into a
 
05:54:35.868 --> 05:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
new one
 
05:54:38.628 --> 05:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
with and major revisions at the same
 
05:54:38.638 --> 05:54:39.410 align:start position:0%
with and major revisions at the same
time

05:54:39.410 --> 05:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:54:42.048 --> 05:54:42.058 align:start position:0%
that's fine except that we also had a
 
05:54:45.230 --> 05:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of other bills that affected
 
05:54:48.230 --> 05:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
other licensing statutes that referred
 
05:54:48.240 --> 05:54:49.430 align:start position:0%
other licensing statutes that referred
to

05:54:49.430 --> 05:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:54:49.440 --> 05:54:51.708 align:start position:0%
to
the

05:54:51.708 --> 05:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:54:55.490 --> 05:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
the oplc statute and they couldn't refer
 
05:54:58.970 --> 05:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
to the correct new statute because it
 
05:55:01.128 --> 05:55:01.138 align:start position:0%
didn't exist yet
 
05:55:03.830 --> 05:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
it refers to the old statute but we
 
05:55:07.190 --> 05:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
still don't want to ignore those items
 
05:55:09.530 --> 05:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
so this
 
05:55:12.708 --> 05:55:12.718 align:start position:0%
amendment gives the enrolled bills
 
05:55:16.788 --> 05:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
committee and OLS the authority to say
 
05:55:21.230 --> 05:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
oh this is an oplc Bill instead of going
 
05:55:23.690 --> 05:55:23.700 align:start position:0%
to this RSA which doesn't exist anymore
 
05:55:27.170 --> 05:55:27.180 align:start position:0%
we put it in the new one it is purely to
 
05:55:28.910 --> 05:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
allow them to take care of this
 
05:55:31.490 --> 05:55:31.500 align:start position:0%
mechanical process and keep us from
 
05:55:33.590 --> 05:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
having a whole slew of bills next year
 
05:55:36.770 --> 05:55:36.780 align:start position:0%
to do it ourselves so I and since I
 
05:55:38.810 --> 05:55:38.820 align:start position:0%
would be dealing with it next year I
 
05:55:40.850 --> 05:55:40.860 align:start position:0%
simply hope you will support this
 
05:55:45.350 --> 05:55:45.360 align:start position:0%

05:59:10.548 --> 05:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
what was that we have two rep tour cots

05:59:18.170 --> 05:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:19.970 --> 05:59:19.980 align:start position:0%
um do we also have some people
 
05:59:21.890 --> 05:59:21.900 align:start position:0%
sponsoring holes
 
05:59:24.530 --> 05:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I went off script and I got
 
05:59:28.610 --> 05:59:28.620 align:start position:0%
sidetracked okay uh yes we have
 
05:59:30.910 --> 05:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Pearl
 
05:59:35.510 --> 05:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
representing hole 17. he's for district
 
05:59:38.390 --> 05:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
17. and I think representative Bert cell
 
05:59:40.610 --> 05:59:40.620 align:start position:0%
said that there might be a sponsorship
 
05:59:42.830 --> 05:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
of the 19th hole
 
05:59:45.530 --> 05:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
I believe the beer caucus is sponsoring
 
05:59:48.048 --> 05:59:48.058 align:start position:0%
the 19th hole that's the way it should
 
05:59:48.058 --> 05:59:50.288 align:start position:0%
the 19th hole that's the way it should
be

05:59:50.288 --> 05:59:50.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:53.330 --> 05:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
but there is a nice payoff if you make
 
05:59:56.030 --> 05:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
the hole in one sink the shot and you
 
05:59:58.610 --> 05:59:58.620 align:start position:0%
can win twenty thousand dollars which
 
06:00:01.190 --> 06:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
could buy you a used pickup truck
 
06:00:03.910 --> 06:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
or a used Prius
 
06:00:06.170 --> 06:00:06.180 align:start position:0%
uh but more good news there will be a
 
06:00:08.448 --> 06:00:08.458 align:start position:0%

06:05:23.030 --> 06:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
I was just as
 
06:05:25.548 --> 06:05:25.558 align:start position:0%
first of all I don't I don't
 
06:05:27.948 --> 06:05:27.958 align:start position:0%
secondly I was just a surprise to see
 
06:05:29.390 --> 06:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
your face when I crawled through the
 
06:05:31.490 --> 06:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
passenger side of that car
 
06:05:34.490 --> 06:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
as you were to see mine so
 
06:05:34.500 --> 06:05:35.150 align:start position:0%
as you were to see mine so
um

06:05:35.150 --> 06:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:37.910 --> 06:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
regardless I just I still feel that you
 
06:05:40.368 --> 06:05:40.378 align:start position:0%
did a good job and you treated me with
 
06:05:42.830 --> 06:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
compassion and I just felt that it would
 
06:05:44.270 --> 06:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
be appropriate to give you public
 
06:05:48.130 --> 06:05:48.140 align:start position:0%
recognition for it all right thank you
 
06:05:48.140 --> 06:05:52.430 align:start position:0%
recognition for it all right thank you
[Music]

06:05:52.430 --> 06:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:54.470 --> 06:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
sure recognized representative Horrigan
 
06:06:01.250 --> 06:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:03.708 --> 06:06:03.718 align:start position:0%
my speech is a
 
06:06:06.288 --> 06:06:06.298 align:start position:0%
my speech is uh short I'll make it even
 
06:06:08.990 --> 06:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
shorter I was uh we've had a good day
 
06:06:10.788 --> 06:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
today a lot of bipartisanship and I
 
06:06:12.230 --> 06:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want to
 
06:06:14.810 --> 06:06:14.820 align:start position:0%
want to ruin that in any way but it's
 
06:06:18.110 --> 06:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
just there's a historical marker 278 was
 
06:06:20.510 --> 06:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
put up uh well last month on May 1st and
 
06:06:22.128 --> 06:06:22.138 align:start position:0%
then taken down two weeks later which
 
06:06:25.070 --> 06:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
honored a woman named Elizabeth Gurley
 
06:06:27.770 --> 06:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
Flynn also known as the rebel girl and
 
06:06:27.780 --> 06:06:28.910 align:start position:0%
Flynn also known as the rebel girl and
um

06:06:28.910 --> 06:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:31.128 --> 06:06:31.138 align:start position:0%
I think certainly she there are some
 
06:06:33.230 --> 06:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
things uh there's some things she did
 
06:06:35.448 --> 06:06:35.458 align:start position:0%
which people don't agree with now but uh
 
06:06:37.548 --> 06:06:37.558 align:start position:0%
you know for the most part she was a
 
06:06:40.730 --> 06:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
remarkable person and she agrees uh I
 
06:06:43.070 --> 06:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
think she deserved the uh historical
 
06:06:45.890 --> 06:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
marker it would have been um well she
 
06:06:47.868 --> 06:06:47.878 align:start position:0%
lived at 12 Montgomery Street which is
 
06:06:49.788 --> 06:06:49.798 align:start position:0%
not far from the state house and that
 
06:06:51.470 --> 06:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
her house doesn't exist anymore but they
 
06:06:54.230 --> 06:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
put it on the edge of the parking lot of
 
06:06:56.990 --> 06:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
the Merrimack Valley courthouse and um
 
06:06:59.208 --> 06:06:59.218 align:start position:0%
and actually some unofficial signs were
 
06:07:00.410 --> 06:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
sprung up there so she's probably
 
06:07:01.670 --> 06:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
getting more attention than she would
 
06:07:03.048 --> 06:07:03.058 align:start position:0%
have gotten if they just left it up
 
06:07:05.150 --> 06:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
there and um
 
06:07:07.850 --> 06:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
she also happened her family happened to
 
06:07:10.128 --> 06:07:10.138 align:start position:0%
be a neighbor of Mary Baker Eddie the
 
06:07:11.570 --> 06:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
founder of Christian Science whose
 
06:07:13.368 --> 06:07:13.378 align:start position:0%
historical marker is still standing and
 
06:07:17.448 --> 06:07:17.458 align:start position:0%
I certainly think uh Christian Science
 
06:07:20.390 --> 06:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's probably an outmoded uh I apologize
 
06:07:22.070 --> 06:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
any Christian Scientist that was an
 
06:07:24.830 --> 06:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
outmoded uh means of health of a health
 
06:07:26.270 --> 06:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
care and probably the particular
 
06:07:26.280 --> 06:07:27.650 align:start position:0%
care and probably the particular
political

06:07:27.650 --> 06:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
political
 
06:07:30.110 --> 06:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
um parties you belonged to also had what
 
06:07:32.448 --> 06:07:32.458 align:start position:0%
are now outmoded ideas about politics
 
06:07:35.090 --> 06:07:35.100 align:start position:0%
and how to organize an economy but
 
06:07:37.250 --> 06:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
I think the markers still still should
 
06:07:39.410 --> 06:07:39.420 align:start position:0%
be put up if not uh on the courthouse
 
06:07:41.208 --> 06:07:41.218 align:start position:0%
but somewhere so
 
06:07:43.548 --> 06:07:43.558 align:start position:0%
um I'll uh
 
06:07:45.590 --> 06:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
that's probably more day what do they
 
06:07:47.030 --> 06:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
need to say about it but I think that
 
06:07:49.548 --> 06:07:49.558 align:start position:0%
was uh just sort of unfair not everybody
 
06:07:52.128 --> 06:07:52.138 align:start position:0%
who has an historical marker is perfect
 
06:07:54.350 --> 06:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
and she served it and certainly none of
 
06:07:56.930 --> 06:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
us are perfect so I would
 
06:07:59.090 --> 06:07:59.100 align:start position:0%
that's a I'd like to urge you to say
 
06:08:00.830 --> 06:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
that and I probably will
 
06:08:02.270 --> 06:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know how far to go but I think
 
06:08:03.590 --> 06:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
it will be exploring some way to have a
 
06:08:04.970 --> 06:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
resolution or a bill or something to
 
06:08:06.830 --> 06:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
address that issue at some point in the
 
06:08:10.670 --> 06:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
future so thanks Tim congratulations to
 
06:08:13.070 --> 06:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh you Mr Speaker and our leadership for
 
06:08:14.930 --> 06:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
getting the budget over the line uh so
 
06:08:17.150 --> 06:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
easily it was uh definitely I've been
 
06:08:18.110 --> 06:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
through eight budgets and that's
 
06:08:19.788 --> 06:08:19.798 align:start position:0%
definitely the best budget uh by far
 
06:08:21.770 --> 06:08:21.780 align:start position:0%
that we at least the best budget process
 
06:08:25.670 --> 06:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:25.680 --> 06:08:27.410 align:start position:0%

Garrett
 
06:08:37.548 --> 06:08:37.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:40.610 --> 06:08:40.620 align:start position:0%

06:08:46.310 --> 06:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
I'm raising today to say thank you to
 
06:08:50.510 --> 06:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
everyone who respect me for who I am
 
06:08:53.270 --> 06:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
many of you know English is not my first
 
06:08:53.280 --> 06:08:55.670 align:start position:0%
many of you know English is not my first
language

06:08:55.670 --> 06:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:58.490 --> 06:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
many times I've been told that people
 
06:09:00.590 --> 06:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
don't understand when I'm speaking
 
06:09:02.510 --> 06:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
I'm very sorry
 
06:09:04.850 --> 06:09:04.860 align:start position:0%
I try my best
 
06:09:08.750 --> 06:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:12.048 --> 06:09:12.058 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to tell
 
06:09:15.110 --> 06:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
not just the Democrats and Republicans
 
06:09:18.048 --> 06:09:18.058 align:start position:0%
thank you for those who
 
06:09:22.190 --> 06:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
respect me and work with me and show me
 
06:09:24.410 --> 06:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
that I'm another state representative
 
06:09:26.750 --> 06:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
who's here to represent their
 
06:09:26.760 --> 06:09:29.208 align:start position:0%
who's here to represent their
constituents

06:09:29.208 --> 06:09:29.218 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
06:09:31.788 --> 06:09:31.798 align:start position:0%
but I'm very disappointed
 
06:09:34.788 --> 06:09:34.798 align:start position:0%
very disappointed
 
06:09:38.270 --> 06:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
with people from my own party today
 
06:09:41.810 --> 06:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
after I make a statement that I would
 
06:09:43.850 --> 06:09:43.860 align:start position:0%
not support the budget because there
 
06:09:46.368 --> 06:09:46.378 align:start position:0%
were certain things in the budget that I
 
06:09:46.378 --> 06:09:48.170 align:start position:0%
were certain things in the budget that I
don't

06:09:48.170 --> 06:09:48.180 align:start position:0%
don't
 
06:09:52.128 --> 06:09:52.138 align:start position:0%
personally believe or respect
 
06:09:54.230 --> 06:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
I was approached by people on my own
 
06:09:57.410 --> 06:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
body and told me that I'm one issue
 
06:09:59.270 --> 06:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
state representative
 
06:10:01.368 --> 06:10:01.378 align:start position:0%
which I'm not
 
06:10:03.048 --> 06:10:03.058 align:start position:0%
I'm asking
 
06:10:06.350 --> 06:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
not just Democrats and Republicans
 
06:10:09.470 --> 06:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
but I work with both sides of the aisle
 
06:10:11.628 --> 06:10:11.638 align:start position:0%
with many issues
 
06:10:14.570 --> 06:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
not just here in the state halls but
 
06:10:16.610 --> 06:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
with the Hillsborough County
 
06:10:19.368 --> 06:10:19.378 align:start position:0%
I try to work with everyone
 
06:10:21.948 --> 06:10:21.958 align:start position:0%
I feel very disappointed because I show
 
06:10:25.190 --> 06:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
it everywhere and some of the people who
 
06:10:27.288 --> 06:10:27.298 align:start position:0%
call me out today and told me that I'm
 
06:10:29.750 --> 06:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
just one issue person
 
06:10:32.750 --> 06:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
I want them to told me where you been
 
06:10:35.628 --> 06:10:35.638 align:start position:0%

06:10:37.610 --> 06:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
everywhere in the state
 
06:10:39.830 --> 06:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
support a new community when you're not
 
06:10:39.840 --> 06:10:40.910 align:start position:0%
support a new community when you're not
there

06:10:40.910 --> 06:10:40.920 align:start position:0%

06:10:43.548 --> 06:10:43.558 align:start position:0%

one issue person
 
06:10:51.250 --> 06:10:51.260 align:start position:0%
I want you to tell me you fit in my face
 
06:10:53.690 --> 06:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
where have you been
 
06:10:56.170 --> 06:10:56.180 align:start position:0%
when I spend hours and hours on my day
 
06:10:58.670 --> 06:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
supporting new constituents when you're
 
06:11:02.090 --> 06:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:04.310 --> 06:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
I want you to tell me
 
06:11:07.788 --> 06:11:07.798 align:start position:0%
how can you ask me to support issues
 
06:11:09.470 --> 06:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
that you care
 
06:11:11.750 --> 06:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
but when I ask you to support something
 
06:11:14.750 --> 06:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
you call me out
 
06:11:17.868 --> 06:11:17.878 align:start position:0%
like I'm not a human or like I don't oh
 
06:11:20.390 --> 06:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
my community don't don't even matter
 
06:11:22.128 --> 06:11:22.138 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you
 
06:11:24.530 --> 06:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
show me your respect
 
06:11:26.570 --> 06:11:26.580 align:start position:0%
don't show the respect only when you
 
06:11:28.670 --> 06:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
need the ball from my community show
 
06:11:30.410 --> 06:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
