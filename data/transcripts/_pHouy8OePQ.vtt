e

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter where you're sitting
 
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
you can move the name
 
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
tag they're
 
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
portable okay good morning everybody uh
 
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
we're ready to go ahead with a
 
00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for the four bills which we
 
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
discussed yesterday all Finance Orient
 
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
our policy bills with a fiscal note that
 
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
has to we have to get these things out
 
00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 align:start position:0%
by February the 15th
 
00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh the bills which we're going to be
 
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
discussing today are 1583
 
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.910 align:start position:0%
discussing today are 1583
1586

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
1586
 
00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
1686 and
 
00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 align:start position:0%
1656 it's very confusing there's a lot
 
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
of sixes in there and and a lot of five
 
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
so um and they're all dealing primarily
 
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
with the topic of how we fund
 
00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 align:start position:0%
education and there's some commonality
 
00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
between all these bills maybe not in in
 
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
the concept but there is there there
 
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
there's a commonality is they're dealing
 
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
with you know how do we support special
 
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
education how do we deal with this and
 
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
that and so there in our discussion here
 
00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 align:start position:0%
um you're you can't talk one bill in
 
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
isolation because you're also going to
 
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
be impacting another bill so my intent
 
00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
is that we we we your bill is a little
 
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
bit different represent luno than some
 
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
of the others which are dealing with
 
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
specific elements within a current
 
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
Formula yours is also dealing with you
 
00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 align:start position:0%
know that but it goes
 
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
beyond so so I'm I'm not going to be
 
00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 align:start position:0%
discussing like opening up now we're
 
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
going to discuss
 
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
1583 we're going to start opening that
 
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to open up and start working
 
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
on uh some of the matters which are
 
00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
contributing to this and then narrowing
 
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
it down to specific bills so what I'd
 
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
also like to say right now is this is
 
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
not where we're going to be meeting on
 
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.070 align:start position:0%
not where we're going to be meeting on
the

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
19th um uh this room is really not
 
00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 align:start position:0%
conducive for a a committee like this to
 
00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
work closely together so we're represent
 
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
Emer sitting beside me from Finance has
 
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
kindly offered his room downstairs on
 
00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
the first floor which is really
 
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
conducive to on on yeah on on the First
 
00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
on second floor 209 yeah excuse me yeah
 
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
it's above where I was thinking I I was
 
00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 align:start position:0%
thinking the Senate Finance room
 
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 align:start position:0%
upstairs right above it and so on the
 
00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
second floor down on the left hand side
 
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
is where we will be meeting and that
 
00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
room is really brings us closer together
 
00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
and work as a real working committee
 
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
rather than having to look down and see
 
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
what represent Luna's doing down there
 
00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 align:start position:0%
Beyond represent mile which is often
 
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
times hard to see and and the same thing
 
00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
with with uh looking down this end too
 
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
here to represent spillsbury
 
00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:22.759 align:start position:0%
so 209 yeah
 
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
209 so what I'm going to do initially
 
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
here is pass out information that
 
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
everybody we we're going to be talking
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
about and you may not have some of that
 
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 align:start position:0%
in front of you right now for example
 
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
represent cascaden do you have a copy of
 
00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 align:start position:0%
the Blue
 
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
Book you you brought yours okay so every
 
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
does everybody have a copy of that
 
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
because we do have other copies in the
 
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.189 align:start position:0%
because we do have other copies in the
office

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
here okay so I'm going to hand out some
 
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
materials right now and they're not for
 
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
discussion this moment but there's
 
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
things we may be looking at as we go
 
00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
through so you can put it in your in
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
it okay why don't we go that way with
 
00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 align:start position:0%
these and that way with
 
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
those and there's no order in which I'm
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
passing these things out it's just
 
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
information that's going to be maybe
 
00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 align:start position:0%
perhaps valuable to some of the
 
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 align:start position:0%

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
these past reports which have come out
 
00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
on funding education we'll see look at
 
00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
the original 20 uh it came out in 2008
 
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 align:start position:0%

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
referencing part of that or looking at
 
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
the recent report that came out from the
 
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 align:start position:0%

four five they're already in bundles I
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
trra okay so we might as well get it all
 
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:39.909 align:start position:0%
trra okay so we might as well get it all
out

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going there will be a reports

everything no I I I'll talk to you later
 
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.309 align:start position:0%
everything no I I I'll talk to you later
about

00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:07:57.869 --> 00:07:57.879 align:start position:0%
that got to remember this is a committee
 
00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:01.479 align:start position:0%
that's been put together by the speaker
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
and the minority leader of the the house
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
so with that um we're going to be
 
00:08:12.189 --> 00:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
functioning a little bit differently
 
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
than some of the regular subcommittees
 
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
where's this one coming
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
from did are there enough copies for
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
everybody here
 
00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:23.479 align:start position:0%

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
down that then oh okay I I was think we
 
00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:34.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:42.069 --> 00:09:42.079 align:start position:0%
here okay let's just make sure when you
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
got them all that everybody has a copy
 
00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:45.519 align:start position:0%
of everything here does everybody have a
 
00:09:48.509 --> 00:09:48.519 align:start position:0%
copy of the 2008
 
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
report okay there's also some backup
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
material for that which shows how the
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
inputs were for that backup report and
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
that there is also uh a sheet that was

McGuire I have not had a chance to look
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
at this it's a possible Amendment uh
 
00:10:22.269 --> 00:10:22.279 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:25.190 align:start position:0%
dealing with
swep

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
swep
 
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay there's a New Hampshire

foundational opportunity program program
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
information sheet here which was
 
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
provided by represent luno and passed
 
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:46.509 --> 00:10:46.519 align:start position:0%
blue this also was just recently uh put
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
together and passed around by represent
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
that there's
 
00:10:55.079 --> 00:10:57.550 align:start position:0%
that there's
a

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
report see I I don't know if these are
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
stapled together or not uh subcommittee
 
00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
2022 um see what a establishing a
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget program
 
00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:12.870 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget program
for

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.509 align:start position:0%
for
funding

00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't know it's just it's just a
 
00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
report from 2022 of sub activity there's
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
also the report from represent umberger
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
and there's also a bill as was
 
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
introduced back in
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
2011 and there's within that 2011 on one
 
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
of the back pages there's how at one
 
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
point in time there was a suggestion how
 
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
to deal with swep which we might want to
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
and lastly I have a report here provided
 
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Education which was
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
provided us back in November 15 20 23 uh
 
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
deals with uh current law adequacy Aid
 
00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
per pupil
 
00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:17.959 align:start position:0%
fy2 and the conel adequacy aid per pupil
 
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
and does not consider the ran case and
 
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
only Chang is making base adequacy Aid $
 
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.990 align:start position:0%
only Chang is making base adequacy Aid $
7,356

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
7,356
 
00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
And1 that's so sort of like a small
 
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:33.030 align:start position:0%
And1 that's so sort of like a small
spreadsheet

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay yes represent Casen thank you Mr
 
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:37.959 align:start position:0%
chair just wanted to point out that I
 
00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
believe um if not all the documents you
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
passed out this morning might be still
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh uploaded on the car SE Institute
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
website because a lot of these we used
 
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
in our commission work but it would be
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
available at the car SE UNH Cary
 
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839 align:start position:0%
Institute website for those who want to
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
know the and this is that's a good point
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
and this is why I've asked Jen to sit at
 
00:13:03.189 --> 00:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
the table with us Jenifer four who is
 
00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:04.430 align:start position:0%
the table with us Jenifer four who is
our

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
research uh what's your official title
 
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.470 align:start position:0%
research uh what's your official title
assistant

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
director director assistant director so
 
00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
you got and and then yourself so she's
 
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
here to work with us
 
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
and it was mentioned to me this morning
 
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
earlier that that is also available
 
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
where would they find this information
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
like these reports on the department
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.509 align:start position:0%
 
lb

00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:42.519 align:start position:0%
lb
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
y okay
 
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
okay and if we need to you know um have
 
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
reference to some of the Constitutional
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
aspects we will be discussing you can go
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
to the Cary or or Jen could even put a
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
link out for that that those links were
 
00:13:59.710 --> 00:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
there I saw that last night that she
 
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
sent out an email with all those links I
 
00:14:04.509 --> 00:14:04.519 align:start position:0%
think was to you represent spillsbury
 
00:14:04.519 --> 00:14:06.509 align:start position:0%
think was to you represent spillsbury
so

00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:06.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
yep so with that I'd like to um just for
 
00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:13.759 align:start position:0%
our quick discussion so everybody
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
everybody here was not here back in 2011
 
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:21.160 align:start position:0%
or or 2008 and there's background
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
information there which leads to where
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
we are today with the formulas and and
 
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
it even goes back further than that but
 
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think were you here with augen B
 
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
I was not yeah you were a Deputy
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioner back then yes you were
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
working thank you so I'd like to start
 
00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
out with that 2008 and just do h a look
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
at that report quickly uh then and
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
because this all background information
 
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
which will relate to what we're doing uh
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
today this is the one that looks with
 
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
that big red Capital dome in the center
 
00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
of it and there was a sheet which I
 
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
passed out which it might be easier to
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
look at appendix
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
report this deals with the inputs as
 
00:15:12.509 --> 00:15:12.519 align:start position:0%
they were established back then and we
 
00:15:14.189 --> 00:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we'll be talking about inputs
 
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
versus performance at on the other side
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
of the point um so the inputs are there
 
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
and appendix
 
00:15:28.509 --> 00:15:28.519 align:start position:0%
a shows you those elements or components
 
00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
cost the base cost of course is the cost
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
that on the leftand side of our present
 
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
current formula is what we uh in terms
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
of adequacy uh allocate per pupil along
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
with the differentiated but we're
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
looking right now only at the base cost
 
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
so you see that there was an amount put
 
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
in for teachers and teacher salary you
 
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
and they added in a 5% salary increase
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
and the benefits of 33% and they came
 
00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
out with the total cost of a teacher at
 
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
$ 47,2
 
00:16:14.309 --> 00:16:14.319 align:start position:0%
67 then they also looked at and this is
 
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
another area we may want to look at and
 
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
we will be looking at I'm sure somewhere
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
along the way if we're talking about um
 
00:16:22.829 --> 00:16:22.839 align:start position:0%
uh this in terms of either ways we're
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
going to fund education the pupil
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
teacher ratio in the classroom how we
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
base that on
 
00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
and for K through two you can see on the
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
next line down it was one teacher per 25
 
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
students that's what that
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
basic cost is built upon and stud and
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
20% for specialty teachers added on and
 
00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
then there was for grades 3 through 12 a
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
ratio of 1 to 30 students with a 20% for
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
specialy teachers added
 
00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
on there is also in this as a component
 
00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
a principle of a
 
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
building and the principal was salary of
 
00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:09.549 align:start position:0%
building and the principal was salary of
$5,151

00:17:09.549 --> 00:17:09.559 align:start position:0%
$5,151
 
00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
5% salary increase and you can see the
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
benefit package of 28% and the total
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
cost was
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.669 --> 00:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
14,014 and for they have that ratio one
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
students so going on down uh principal
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
administr strative assistant you can see
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
the same thing there and that cost is
 
00:17:58.990 --> 00:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's it right well if there's
 
00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:05.690 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh there was technology professional
 
00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:11.559 align:start position:0%
development facility operation there's
 
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
Transportation there all these items
 
00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
would come into this
 
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
formula so this is something we might
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
want to look at in terms of if if we are
 
00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
still operating upon the obviously the
 
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
one of those cases is said the average
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
cost of a teacher might be
 
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
$57,000 is that the average of all is or
 
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
is are we taking the first year teacher
 
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:38.200 align:start position:0%
the third year teacher when the that was
 
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
all discussed within the 2008
 
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
study um going away from that right now
 
00:18:48.029 --> 00:18:48.039 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to put our time on
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
the past but there's been some
 
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
discussion even
 
00:18:55.149 --> 00:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh is there a relationship
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
between student achievement and chent
 
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
student growth and property valuation
 
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.070 align:start position:0%
student growth and property valuation
and

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
poverty and in the 2018 report I'm still
 
00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
looking at that same bundle of materials
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
but there's this sheet right here which
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
shows achievement we went looked at the
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
Statewide uh assessment which is
 
00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:19.640 align:start position:0%
given and we found that in group one
 
00:19:21.149 --> 00:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
which was comprised of all those
 
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
communities with a property valuation of
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
$660,000 or less there were 26 districts
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
that that fit into that column right
 
00:19:32.149 --> 00:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
there into that
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
category in quartile one there's four
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
quartiles on our testing uh quartile one
 
00:19:41.149 --> 00:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
is at the bottom you're moving up to
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
where their uh students are really
 
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
achieving well at to a quartile of four
 
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
uh a result of four you can see in that
 
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
first category of those 26 19
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
districts 73% of those districts were in
 
00:19:56.039 --> 00:19:57.470 align:start position:0%
districts 73% of those districts were in
cortile

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
cortile
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:06.039 align:start position:0%
yes um this this sheet right here if you
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
keep on marching through after you get
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
through what was in the packet dealing
 
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
with the 2008 you'll find it like the
 
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
fifth page yeah I I didn't have time to
 
00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:20.799 align:start position:0%
number them yeah um you can go through
 
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
and see how that works because in
 
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
quartile four in those districts only
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
7.5% of the students fit in that
 
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
quartile of four as achievement test you
 
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
go to the other side to the Other
 
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
Extreme and you go to group four which
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
they had a property valuation of $1
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
million or more per
 
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
pupil and it's the flip it's a reverse
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
how many students were in the low
 
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
achieving quartile 19% there were 122
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
districts in this
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
category of those which were fitting
 
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
into cortile 4 41 districts or 34% were
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
in that top you know fourth quartile in
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment so there is a
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
relationship further if you go to the
 
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.789 align:start position:0%
relationship further if you go to the
next

00:21:09.789 --> 00:21:09.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
sheet this is a sheet where we took the
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
and worked with the Department of
 
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
Education and this is data that's older
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure it's still very reflective
 
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
of what we're I'm trying to communicate
 
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
the next sheet has Berlin at the top
 
00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:26.039 align:start position:0%
North umberland Claremont so is
 
00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
everybody on that page looking through
 
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
it this one right
 
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
here this is a sheet where we took the
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
average Proficiency in math and reading
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
and the cortile if they have a one they
 
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
were in that lower cortile on the
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment the next one over
 
00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
is the equiz valuation uh cortile and
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
you notice the school districts that
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
have a one and a
 
00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
one how it works out represent cascaden
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
that town you live in was right there on
 
00:21:59.549 --> 00:21:59.559 align:start position:0%
top of the
 
00:22:02.269 --> 00:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
list you can also go over to the extreme
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
right side of that uh sheet that was
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
done and we were looking at what is the
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
the pupil teacher ratio in those
 
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.430 align:start position:0%
the pupil teacher ratio in those
particular

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
communities at that time I not know if
 
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
that's the case today but in grades 1
 
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
and two in your District represent uh
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
cascaden it was 23
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
to1 in grades three four it was 19 to1
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to read my you know printing
 
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
there and grade 5 through wait it was 20
 
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
to1 you can go down the list and see how
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
those all All Shook out but there's a
 
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
definite relationship if you're in that
 
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
lower cortile for uh equalized property
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
valuation chances are your District's
 
00:22:44.909 --> 00:22:44.919 align:start position:0%
going to be either in a one or a
 
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
two so going on to the next sheet just
 
00:22:50.269 --> 00:22:50.279 align:start position:0%
this is information which we've had the
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
next sheet is also explanation of that
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
one right
 
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
there the next sheet is uh dealing with
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
more and as you recall last year there
 
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
was a bill which we we uh in from the
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
policy perspective when we came to the
 
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
area of differentiated aid for special
 
00:23:21.149 --> 00:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
education we were looking at is it
 
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate or proper that we allocate
 
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
one value one costing value for all
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
special educ ucation kids we have over
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
30,000 kids in special education in the
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:39.269 --> 00:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
IEP and there was an attempt to do it by
 
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
a weighted value and the weighted value
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
concept is done in numerous States
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
throughout the United States and it's
 
00:23:48.029 --> 00:23:48.039 align:start position:0%
also reflective in some of the reports
 
00:23:50.669 --> 00:23:50.679 align:start position:0%
which we will be talking about but this
 
00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
is an attempt that we have done and when
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
we talking about IEPs and special
 
00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
education those 13 IEP categories down
 
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
below so you can Rel you can look at
 
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
that and say well there's some kids that
 
00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
maybe have speech once or twice a week
 
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
for a half hour from a speech
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
pathologist but there's other students
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
that may be orthopedically handicapped
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
or have a traumatic brain injury or one
 
00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
of those other categories which requires
 
00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
much much more time and attention to
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
that youngster in school or student and
 
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:26.200 align:start position:0%
so um how would we get that information
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
and there is a reporting process that uh
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
I can get to that sheet here that the
 
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has for the
 
00:24:41.789 --> 00:24:41.799 align:start position:0%
federal government yes that's the the
 
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
this one right
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
here this information is available it
 
00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
just has to be put into some format of a
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and and gotten for us so
 
00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
this is a topic that if you care to go
 
00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
that way in our discussions um we can go
 
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
in that direction but it it is available
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh individuals with Disabilities Act
 
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
information um going
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
further I think that's all that's in
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
that packet right there that we need to
 
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
talk at this point in
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
time other information what you do have
 
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:26.120 align:start position:0%
is the the umberger report I don't think
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
there's a great need to get get into a
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion on that there's a a
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
majority report and there's a minority
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
report attached to that uh document
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
um uh chair lad yes yeah before we get
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
too far away from what we were just
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
reviewing yes um the last part of your
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
discussion I mean all all the all of the
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
presentation is very interesting the uh
 
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
particularly with the um the part uh
 
00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
surrounding the three categories a b and
 
00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.789 align:start position:0%
surrounding the three categories a b and
c

00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
c
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
of special education Aid how were the um
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
how were the
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
weights um determined I guess oh based
 
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
on like the
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
existing what what what that was yes we
 
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
took the existing what we have and that
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
would be the category a you know the the
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
student getting Speech Pathology twice a
 
00:26:24.389 --> 00:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
week or something they would get that
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
IEP costing value but the going down to
 
00:26:29.389 --> 00:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
the next one we're starting to talk
 
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
about students which
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
are needing much more service and so you
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
can see that there's kind of a ratio
 
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
between going from one to the other
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
whereas you get to category three which
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
is the residentially placed youngster
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
double and that that whole scheme is the
 
00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
dollars were trying to be built around
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh it wasn't
 
00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
really a program based upon it was part
 
00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
partially built on program where we're
 
00:27:00.669 --> 00:27:00.679 align:start position:0%
recognizing this is a concept that
 
00:27:03.549 --> 00:27:03.559 align:start position:0%
probably should be in the costing amount
 
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
needs work and and and there wasn't time
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
to do that okay yes representative he
 
00:27:12.389 --> 00:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
just a question with regard to that what
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
is the source of the information in
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
terms of cost by the categories that
 
00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
you're discussing is that available is
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
doe2 I I don't believe it
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
is so that see now we do have we do have
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh Mark coming in this afternoon I when
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
when I initially went after this
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
information I was able to get it from uh
 
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn Davis also at doe she was able
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
to tell me you have this many students
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
which are ABS actually residentially
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
placed maybe in Tennessee or maybe in
 
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
some school which houses them with
 
00:27:54.269 --> 00:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
tuition and board and all that uh here
 
00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
in our own state that information we
 
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
have we know that's roughly around
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 600 to 700 students and
 
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
that I'm using rough figures because I
 
00:28:03.789 --> 00:28:03.799 align:start position:0%
don't have the accurate figure for this
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
year and then we were able to break it
 
00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
down with the other students which we're
 
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
talking about by category and there was
 
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
some discussion with Rebecca fet on that
 
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
but most of that was basically coming
 
00:28:17.549 --> 00:28:17.559 align:start position:0%
from discussing with some of the special
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
ed directors throughout the state not
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
many done so so Rick Rick what I was
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
really trying to get I think Mary's
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
trying to get at it too is th these
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
numbers are formula cost so basically
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
the differentiated Aid factors they're
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
not cost for providing special education
 
00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
services for those for those are you to
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount for category a yeah
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
yeah looking looking at the 37 million
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
for a and the 38 million for B and the
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
C where was
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.110 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:03.640 align:start position:0%
it yeah the what what you're talking
 
00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:06.519 align:start position:0%
about are the the the what's in our
 
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
formula now for differentiated
 
00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
Aid I
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
I the weighted the weighted formula if
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
you're looking in the materials came out
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
of the 2020 is like it's a weighted
 
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
value of 4.2 t 29 times that base amount
 
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
which you juggled I think it was around
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
$6,500 or so or somewhere around that
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
neighborhood you to multiply that to get
 
00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
the amount which comes up to
 
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
that uh $27 million
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
figure what we had done is that in
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
looking at this uh we had taken and
 
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
built a it's
 
00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
not directly related to how much time
 
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
and what the actual cost is for
 
00:29:55.149 --> 00:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
delivering the services for a student
 
00:29:59.470 --> 00:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
that has a uh uh multiple handicaps or
 
00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
we didn't do that we didn't have that
 
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
source of information available to
 
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
us represent kiss can I I think to
 
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
answer um representative lud's question
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
is that when the schools fill out the
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
idea Part B Grant they they classify it
 
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
three categories so like category a do
 
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
they spend more than 80% of a day in a
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
classroom and then do they spend less
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
than 40% or are they in residential
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking that's where it came from
 
00:30:32.669 --> 00:30:32.679 align:start position:0%
because you got a fact sheet yes is
 
00:30:36.029 --> 00:30:36.039 align:start position:0%
exactly what we use indicators y we use
 
00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
that information that's on that data
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
fact sheet that comes from the federal
 
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
government yeah right partant but but
 
00:30:44.669 --> 00:30:44.679 align:start position:0%
that's not getting to my question Oh My
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
My My question is about what are the
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
what are the actual District costs for
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
these students not what is in our
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
current funding
 
00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
formula no would be on the this isn't
 
00:30:57.389 --> 00:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
about District cost this about funding
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
for this is an issue which we want to
 
00:31:03.789 --> 00:31:03.799 align:start position:0%
get in here on the doe 25 form we have
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
to break down those expenses in terms of
 
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
specifically what we're talking about
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
rather than using that generality here's
 
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
what we have as an expense and dividing
 
00:31:15.789 --> 00:31:15.799 align:start position:0%
by the number of students here's what
 
00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:18.679 align:start position:0%
the cost is for that District we need to
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
be looking at program as well AB
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely but and for each of these
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
categories is that that's why it's going
 
00:31:30.029 --> 00:31:30.039 align:start position:0%
to take some work yeah yeah and and how
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
those categories are matched up there
 
00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
right now is based on an experiential uh
 
00:31:36.909 --> 00:31:36.919 align:start position:0%
perspective from myself when I did it
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
and working with directors out in the
 
00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
field and trying to get an es is this
 
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
one that belongs in that 80% or
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
requiring that much more than that time
 
00:31:48.909 --> 00:31:48.919 align:start position:0%
less about that or
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
40% that's in in the federal guideline
 
00:31:54.269 --> 00:31:54.279 align:start position:0%
gives us some perspective of how to do
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
this and I and I think that's about what
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to get right now with the
 
00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
time we
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
have so yeah Mary might have some I I
 
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
just wanted to mention I do have a bill
 
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
in this year oh yes I realize that I do
 
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
have a bill in this year just to do this
 
00:32:14.909 --> 00:32:14.919 align:start position:0%
um but in my research for my bill Most
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
states do contribute at different levels
 
00:32:20.629 --> 00:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
um I think if you look at the education
 
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
Commission of the states they have some
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
excellent information that provides a
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
lot for that but it concerns me um I
 
00:32:30.029 --> 00:32:30.039 align:start position:0%
think um representative cascaden is
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
referring to a form that the is required
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
for special education folks to fill in
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
so I think if we really dig deep we
 
00:32:39.389 --> 00:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
might be able to come up with better
 
00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
costs for those children so that we have
 
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
guidance better guidance than what we
 
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
have here yes and that's what we tried
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
to do and we didn't get that information
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
back from doe I do have the education
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
committee uh commission the state's
 
00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
report uh that representative Heath is
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
alluding to out on the desk out there
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
it's just amazing looking at the weight
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
of values and some of the states which
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
are doing this now like a Florida Texas
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
uh you know New Jersey there most of
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
them have a weighted value rather than
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
one taking all these and then taking the
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
average uh because it's not the same in
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
every district oh it's so differentiated
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
it it's so different and so that's we
 
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
need to be cognizant of this aspect in
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
anything we
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
do okay yes yes yeah it's a good
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
discussion one of the things that um I
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
think we really need to be sensitive
 
00:33:37.389 --> 00:33:37.399 align:start position:0%
about in small rural districts um if in
 
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
fact a a severely
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
disabled CH a child enters a a school
 
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
district um there are a lot of factors
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
that get thrown in at Town meetings and
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
and it throws the entire budget off so I
 
00:33:54.909 --> 00:33:54.919 align:start position:0%
think we've got to think about that as
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
we think about what we're going to do
 
00:33:58.629 --> 00:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
with special ed in terms of those kinds
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
of costs because one child can just
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
throw an entire budget off um for a
 
00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:07.480 align:start position:0%
local school district a small one yeah
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
that that's the catastrophic aid but
 
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
it's also more than catastrophic Aid I
 
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
can tell you a specific case occurred in
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
sau23 we had students the needed Speech
 
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
Pathology this is back a few years back
 
00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
when Mark Joyce Dr Joyce was uh working
 
00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
with the school administrator
 
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
Association the only way that Hil could
 
00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:31.879 align:start position:0%
get a speech pathologist is through a
 
00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
contracted service from conquer yeah and
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
at that time there was money
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
available for transportation of this
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
it's gone it's gone
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
now that's another burden that's on
 
00:34:48.669 --> 00:34:48.679 align:start position:0%
these districts in the teacher shortage
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
committee which we had we found that
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
this is one of the categories which is
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
very very short in term you know
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
difficult to find some of these trained
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
people that we need to have in our
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
schools and so some much of it's done in
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
the state now through contracted service
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
that is expensive and so you're correct
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately your commission
 
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
studies is not going to be done prior to
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
the our responsibility
 
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:19.720 align:start position:0%
here sure yes yesterday you commented on
 
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
the catastrophic need we're not
 
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.589 align:start position:0%
the catastrophic need we're not
considering

00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
considering
 
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
that as part of this committee is that
 
00:35:29.069 --> 00:35:29.079 align:start position:0%
well I understand correctly
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
well currently currently catastrophic
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
Aid is not part of the adequacy formula
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's a separate formula as you you you
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
do in division two and and if our task
 
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
is if we're looking at you know adequacy
 
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
as is in front of us differentiated Aid
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
you know um extraordinary needs Grant
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
which is not part of that's a grant
 
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
program but it's not there and and I
 
00:35:59.069 --> 00:35:59.079 align:start position:0%
think that the commission that represent
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
Heath's going after is that's a broken
 
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
broken formula too seeing that you you
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
know you the first well we'll use the
 
00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:10.839 align:start position:0%
figure of of $20,000 a kid the first
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
three and a half times that would be
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
you'd have to spend $70,000 first as a
 
00:36:17.069 --> 00:36:17.079 align:start position:0%
community before you're going to get any
 
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:19.720 align:start position:0%
state aid that's 70 grand year and
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's yeah in your budget's based on
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
the previous year and then from three
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
and a half times to 10 times the cost
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
per pup the state kicks in 80% you still
 
00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
have that 20% differential you're going
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
to have to pay for once it gets over the
 
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
10 times the state kicks it in but by
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
that time a small District that only has
 
00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
maybe 70 to 100 students they're having
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
to look elsewhere for the dollar to do
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
this Unfortunately they have to go
 
00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
borrow the money they have to take it
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
from some other aspect of their
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
operating budget so you're borrowing
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
from Paul to pay Susan over here um it
 
00:36:58.480 --> 00:36:59.349 align:start position:0%
from Paul to pay Susan over here um it
doesn't

00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:37:02.349 --> 00:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
work and we we've tried to address
 
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
pooling and all that that's not working
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
hasn't started um that was a bill I
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
think representative Hill passed or got
 
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
through it several years back there was
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh some support from other organizations
 
00:37:17.309 --> 00:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
trying to get that going where districts
 
00:37:20.589 --> 00:37:20.599 align:start position:0%
could pull and put money in and know how
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
to budget for catastrophic Aid um that
 
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:25.720 align:start position:0%
has not occurred
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm not saying it it can't be
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
discussed if we want if you want if we
 
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
think oh that belongs in in
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
adequacy that was a comma yeah I got a
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
the other part of the question is
 
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
category C the 600 students that are
 
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
residential that seems to be
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
catastrophic to me so are is there
 
00:37:48.309 --> 00:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
something is category is there something
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
more than category C I mean somebody
 
00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.790 align:start position:0%
more than category C I mean somebody
away

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:37:54.309 --> 00:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
residentially it doesn't get much more
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
catastrophic right I I understand that
 
00:37:58.990 --> 00:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is slip and
 
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
that's a category which that student is
 
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
a resident in your district and comes
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
down on your student membership correct
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so so are do they what are they
 
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
going to get for you know differentiate
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
Aid that $2,300 or are they going to
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
recognize that that student is going to
 
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
there's going to be more cost to that
 
00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
student there is to a category B student
 
00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:25.640 align:start position:0%
that so that's why we put it in my
 
00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
question is is category C in and of
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
itself catastrophic
 
00:38:34.109 --> 00:38:34.119 align:start position:0%
Aid as it was proposed there as part of
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid and then catastrophic
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
Aid would kick in um also but you get a
 
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
little bit more support from the state
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
okay got it yeah got it all right there
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
another way of trying to address this we
 
00:38:48.309 --> 00:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
knew we couldn't change cat a so this we
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
were're going to do it here okay so Mr
 
00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
chair yeah just just wondering um uh we
 
00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:55.880 align:start position:0%
obviously have limited time because
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
February 15th these bills have to be out
 
00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
but um but what what are we thinking as
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
far as work process going work path
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
going forward with the four bills and I
 
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
mean this is great discussion here and I
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
think it will come up with with with
 
00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
these bills particularly as we you know
 
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
like one of the bills is just about
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
special education funding yeah and uh
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
and so this is going to be great
 
00:39:22.589 --> 00:39:22.599 align:start position:0%
background discussion for that but um
 
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
what what's your thought about work path
 
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
um okay so that's what I was planning on
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
doing after we had the you know
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
discussion this afternoon with uh doe
 
00:39:34.829 --> 00:39:34.839 align:start position:0%
and with Dr then to say okay where what
 
00:39:36.309 --> 00:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
is the work path what are we going to
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
ask for more information we know we're
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
going to need this for discussing your
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
bill we're going to have to for
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
discussing the bill which dealt with the
 
00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
differentiate for special
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
education and uh so guess my question
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
inform did we want to talk about the
 
00:39:52.109 --> 00:39:52.119 align:start position:0%
bills this morning well we will as once
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
we get through these reports and then we
 
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
will in a few seconds here because we've
 
00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
gone through basically you know one of
 
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
and the umberger report is came out with
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
certain recommendations which got there
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
but we never talked about any of the
 
00:40:07.309 --> 00:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
specific inputs okay thank you and and
 
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
so that I think does take us through
 
00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.109 align:start position:0%
so that I think does take us through
these

00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
reports um the only other one that I a
 
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
sheet that you have there was because we
 
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
have a bill on swep and that's a part of
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
two of the
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
bills uh there was a on the back part
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
this was just another wait we saw the
 
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that was proposed by uh
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire and what he's doing is
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
just lowering that 363 million
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
downwards and I don't want to discuss it
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
right now represent we will and and what
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
this one does uh if you looked on page
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
337 um it says a municipality May remit
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
the balance of such exes or any portion
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
thereof to the Department of Revenue
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
Administration as provided paragraph in
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
this paragraph or retain the balance of
 
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
such excess to be used in the current
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal year year or a future fiscal year
 
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
to offset the cost of school building
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
construction or renovation project to
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
offset catastrophic special education uh
 
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
in costs incurred provided that
 
00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the eligibility
 
00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:23.480 align:start position:0%
Provisions set forth in RSA
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
19815 through 19815 AG you
 
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
and W in uh 186c the municipality shall
 
00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
exhaust such excess as condition of
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
eligible so what it's basically trying
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
to say is that you can keep it but
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to use it for these
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
purposes that was a concept rather than
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
having to return it did this become law
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
no it wasn't it wasn't appreciated by
 
00:41:53.069 --> 00:41:53.079 align:start position:0%
the house and but this is another
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
concept of how to deal with swep if you
 
00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
right there was a session in fact on
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
that particular
 
00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:08.119 align:start position:0%
bill um it was put forth by representa
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
hes Flanigan lad Kirk Benton court and
 
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
Jasper and when it came out that stuff
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
was stripped and a number of those
 
00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:21.640 align:start position:0%
people didn't vote for the bill that was
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
the same bill that we we took the money
 
00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
out of the left side of the column
 
00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
through it in the other side in $150
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
million in stabilization Etc
 
00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
and and and here we are
 
00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:40.390 align:start position:0%
and and and here we are
today

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
so I guess I've gone through all that we
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
can at this point in time uh open up
 
00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
this discussion to those four bills and
 
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
strategies how we want to address 1583
 
00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:55.079 align:start position:0%
86 1686 and
 
00:42:58.549 --> 00:42:58.559 align:start position:0%
56 so it's open any ideas here how you
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
like to go at
 
00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
it Mr chair yes yeah I so I would
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
suggest given the the um looking at the
 
00:43:10.109 --> 00:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
U uh the four bills three of them are
 
00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
clearly related to uh to funding
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
formula and uh and the the fourth bill
 
00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:20.559 align:start position:0%
um is related to uh specifically to um
 
00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
swept reform and um and I I would offer
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
i' I'd love to you know sort of quickly
 
00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
walk people through the technical
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
details behind 157
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
1586 um and it's 26 pages long and I
 
00:43:39.069 --> 00:43:39.079 align:start position:0%
don't think we need to belabor every
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
every line of it but uh go through the
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
section review and um and a lot of that
 
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
area is going to touch on obviously
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
areas in the first two bills that talk
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
about base and the special education
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
differentiated weight
 
00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
Factor everybody agree with that
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
sure the the last bill
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
1656 um or not 1656 the the bill doing
 
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
the the swep that involves every Bill
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
too doesn't it and and it does in a way
 
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
so that that's in 1586 as well yesly um
 
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
so you know I think 1586 serves as a as
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
a good uh place for a robust discussion
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
that talks about things that the other
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
ones relate to as well now the the the
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
ones that deal with base cost and
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
special those are really components
 
00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
within the input system we press
 
00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
presently had corre that's right so
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's well let's just go on let's take up
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
yours first and and and talk about that
 
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
you have a sheet what you handed out
 
00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
walk us through it and I'd like to do
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
that could um and and one more thing as
 
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
we go through all this if anybody has a
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
question don't wait till the end ask it
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
immediately so we don't forget
 
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
it he thank so I'd like to go up there
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
and can um
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.079 --> 00:45:21.790 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
put chair members of the special
 
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for uh
 
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
inviting us here to um uh to discuss the
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh technical aspects behind House Bill
 
00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
1586 I feel like we've been up here
 
00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.270 align:start position:0%
1586 I feel like we've been up here
before

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
yes um there's a couple of um couple of
 
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
handouts that passed around earlier one
 
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
of them is uh this right here and it's a
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
a slide deck that really introduces the
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity program and what
 
00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
what the uh what the intent of uh of 50
 
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
1986 is all about the other one is a is
 
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
a um an overview or a summary of the uh
 
00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
of the bill in terms of section by
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
section and uh and I think if it um if
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
it makes sense for for uh Mr ardinger
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
here that we'd sort of quickly go
 
00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
through the slide deck and then spend a
 
00:46:19.549 --> 00:46:19.559 align:start position:0%
little more time going through the
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
sections and uh certainly appreciate I
 
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
think as chair lad has uh has offered
 
00:46:29.069 --> 00:46:29.079 align:start position:0%
interactive um discussion if if um CHL
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%

the conclusions and findings of the
 
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
commission it was one of the best
 
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
experiences I've had uh in New Hampshire
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
working with colleagues on that
 
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
commission it was it was a very uh
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
engaging process that the just going
 
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
through quickly this um uh PowerPoint
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
presentation the the bill is even though
 
00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
it's long because education funding is
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
hard and it has lots of details it's
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward it does six
 
00:48:02.589 --> 00:48:02.599 align:start position:0%
things one it defines constitutional
 
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
adequacy it defines it in terms of
 
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities for good student
 
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
outcomes two it establishes a foundation
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget for every District
 
00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
this is the budget that is projected
 
00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
based on the mechanisms in the bill to
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
allow every District to have the
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
resources they need to help their
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
children hit the defined constitutional
 
00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
adequacy Target three it focuses state
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
budget Aid to districts based on their
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
unique circumstances and challenges if
 
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
uh a particular and that the details are
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
in the Bill and those will be subject
 
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
for your review but just in summary
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
based on the attributes and
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
characteristics that are in the
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
Bill the the the mechanism the formula
 
00:49:03.839 --> 00:49:04.870 align:start position:0%
Bill the the the mechanism the formula
in

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
1586 takes the total resources of the
 
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:10.559 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget and
 
00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
allocates it to districts based on their
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
unique challenges in other words some of
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
you heard yesterday I was a graduate of
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
Stevens High School in Claremont
 
00:49:21.789 --> 00:49:21.799 align:start position:0%
Claremont faces unique challenges today
 
00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
Claremont would get a greater allocation
 
00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:28.839 align:start position:0%
a larger Foundation opportunity budget
 
00:49:31.349 --> 00:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
than other communities who don't face
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
such direct unique challenges four this
 
00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
bill incorporates it in into it
 
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
something that's fundamentally related
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
to what the commissions task was it
 
00:49:50.829 --> 00:49:50.839 align:start position:0%
incorporates a um uh a a property tax
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
relief component a
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
restructuring of the Statewide property
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
tax this commission has not entered into
 
00:50:05.069 --> 00:50:05.079 align:start position:0%
what is a very good discussion I'm I'm
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
born and raised a tax lawyer and does
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
tax policy and had this all tax policy
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
discussions are very important they
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
should be had all the time they should
 
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
raise uh you know questions about the
 
00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:19.559 align:start position:0%
pros and cons of various taxes this
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
particular proposal retains the
 
00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:25.720 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax but it suggests
 
00:50:27.309 --> 00:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
important changes
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
that representative Ames actually
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
authored in uh his bill on this it
 
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
provides low
 
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
income uh property tax payers with
 
00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
important and increased relief it also
 
00:50:49.789 --> 00:50:49.799 align:start position:0%
provides uh an answer uh to the Rand
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
Court uh type of issue where it says
 
00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
that the Statewide property tax which is
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
a state tax is going going to be
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
collected from all the taxpayers placed
 
00:51:04.589 --> 00:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
into the education trust fund and then
 
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
used as one of the sources like the
 
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:08.440 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax which is paid
 
00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
for by all the taxpayers and the
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
business profits tax component this pay
 
00:51:15.789 --> 00:51:15.799 align:start position:0%
it goes in and then is used to satisfy
 
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
the obligations of the budget in here F
 
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
fifth it provides transition grants this
 
00:51:23.069 --> 00:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
bill to
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
communities it is unbelievably important
 
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
I look at representative cascaden who
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
has experien with these districts like
 
00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
and representative lad and my my wife um
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh the project the Enterprise of Public
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
School Systems is very Capital intensive
 
00:51:44.309 --> 00:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
and has fixed costs like Collective
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
bargained agreements and commitments and
 
00:51:49.789 --> 00:51:49.799 align:start position:0%
and building costs and capital costs it
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
is absolutely nonsensical to propose any
 
00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
change to school funding with without
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
making sure that we aren't creating
 
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
shocks that harm any community in their
 
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
Endeavor to get to uh a better answer
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
for the whole state which I believe 1586
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
is and so it provides trans and funds
 
00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:13.839 align:start position:0%
transition grants to communities to make
 
00:52:16.349 --> 00:52:16.359 align:start position:0%
sure that the transition doesn't shock
 
00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
them finally importantly required by the
 
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court in the clar line of cases
 
00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:26.839 align:start position:0%
this bill provides a detailed account
 
00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:29.720 align:start position:0%
accountability rules and it's integrated
 
00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
with the definition of account of of of
 
00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
adequacy a lot really in the current law
 
00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
you don't have a good integration when
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
you do adequacy defined by input
 
00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:43.640 align:start position:0%
costs you can't really say you can't
 
00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
really determine in a clear way whether
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
the district is achieving the goals for
 
00:52:52.789 --> 00:52:52.799 align:start position:0%
the program uh because all they have to
 
00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:55.240 align:start position:0%
do is are they having a teacher with
 
00:52:58.109 --> 00:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
Masters are they having computers
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
whatever your cost inputs are in this
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
case this bill defines constitutional
 
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
adequacy in terms of student outcomes
 
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:09.640 align:start position:0%
and then provides clear data and
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
enforceability requirements that make
 
00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
sure that the state which has the duty
 
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure every child has has a uh
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
access to a a good education regardless
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
of where they live it makes sure that um
 
00:53:27.069 --> 00:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
government is watching to make sure that
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh there are no uh children falling
 
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
through the gaps and where there where
 
00:53:37.789 --> 00:53:37.799 align:start position:0%
the data demonstrates that there may be
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
a problem it provides the mechanisms in
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
increasing stringency to address any
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
deficits and gaps it's that's the bill
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
it it's a it's comprehensive it has six
 
00:53:55.109 --> 00:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
parts yes it's not just focused on one
 
00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:57.640 align:start position:0%
teeny piece it like the commission which
 
00:54:00.589 --> 00:54:00.599 align:start position:0%
had 12 months to study this it tries to
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
get a comprehensive answer that will
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully put to rest the kind of
 
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
continuing wrangling we've had over this
 
00:54:14.109 --> 00:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
uh these issues for decades thank
 
00:54:19.349 --> 00:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
you yes go ahead ref Ames thanks you
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
said to ask questions when and not
 
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise we'll forget them I would
 
00:54:28.589 --> 00:54:28.599 align:start position:0%
forget um but uh I just want to note
 
00:54:28.599 --> 00:54:29.750 align:start position:0%
forget um but uh I just want to note
that

00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:33.309 --> 00:54:33.319 align:start position:0%
the um the Statewide education property
 
00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:35.720 align:start position:0%
tax component that's in this bill that
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
you mentioned um resolves the excess
 
00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
swept issue in a different way
 
00:54:47.069 --> 00:54:47.079 align:start position:0%
than HB
 
00:54:49.829 --> 00:54:49.839 align:start position:0%
1686 the other bill
 
00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
that's that directly addresses excess
 
00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
says return the excess to the
 
00:55:05.309 --> 00:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
state after you've
 
00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
allocated that part which is not excess
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
without trying to Define that
 
00:55:15.789 --> 00:55:15.799 align:start position:0%
um then you return the excess my bill
 
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:19.480 align:start position:0%
says collect the tax this is a state
 
00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
tax and remit the entire proceeds to the
 
00:55:28.109 --> 00:55:28.119 align:start position:0%
state and then then that money goes into
 
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
the pot and goes out according to the
 
00:55:36.029 --> 00:55:36.039 align:start position:0%
formula uh it never it does not stay
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
local so they're very different
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
approaches to uh to this and we can talk
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
a lot more about the pros and cons but I
 
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
just wanted to get that
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
out right and and um and representative
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
Ames uh the bill you're talking about um
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
that was um voted interim study Ways and
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
Means and on the floor so it's an
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
interim study and I think in in in the
 
00:56:05.029 --> 00:56:05.039 align:start position:0%
the back half of um of
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
1586 very very similar to what you what
 
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
you described here and the important
 
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
thing to realize where all of it's
 
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
collected locally 100% of remitted to
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
the uh to the Dr deposited into the
 
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
education trust fund as Mr aringer said
 
00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
the the net out of of of uh of swept
 
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
from adequacy is take it's it's
 
00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:33.640 align:start position:0%
currently it's netted out in the uh in
 
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
19842 some 41 42 I think it's 42 um that
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
part is taken out so that so that
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
districts will get their adequacy Grant
 
00:56:46.349 --> 00:56:46.359 align:start position:0%
as in the current Formula back from the
 
00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
directly from the state and the one
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
qualification in in representative Ames
 
00:56:54.109 --> 00:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
Bill and that was incorporated into this
 
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
is that there are processing fees uh
 
00:56:58.910 --> 00:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
that are are kept just like meals and
 
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
rooms their processing fees kept locally
 
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
to for the cost of the collection and
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's in this bill so I would I would
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
like to just if I could turn to just the
 
00:57:13.309 --> 00:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
second page of this presentation we've
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
gone through the six comms on the bill
 
00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:19.720 align:start position:0%
but this is the fundamental purpose for
 
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
this reform package in the commission
 
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
work there was a stud we had an expert
 
00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
firm paid come to do a study of New

00:57:34.829 --> 00:57:34.839 align:start position:0%
then current a few years ago public
 
00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:37.640 align:start position:0%
education system and its conclusions
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
that were most critical to me are
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
presented in this graph what it shows is
 
00:57:47.069 --> 00:57:47.079 align:start position:0%
that compared to other New England
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
states New Hampshire's division of total
 
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:53.960 align:start position:0%
public education resources we spent
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
about 3.5 billion on public education
 
00:57:59.789 --> 00:57:59.799 align:start position:0%
the distribution of those resources
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
among districts is regressive in other
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
words even though you may have poorer
 
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
families as represented by uh various
 
00:58:17.309 --> 00:58:17.319 align:start position:0%
poverty measures a greater poverty you
 
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
end up not
 
00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
receiving as much Aid compare on this

Hampshire
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
with its graph SL sloping down to
 
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which has worked after the
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
McDuffy case that represent to correct
 
00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
its state Aid distribution so that it's
 
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
directing Aid to the communities with
 
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:43.640 align:start position:0%
the greatest need what Massachusetts has
 
00:58:45.069 --> 00:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
achieved since
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
1993 is a graph that is not regressive
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
it is Progressive it's delivering Aid to
 
00:58:57.069 --> 00:58:57.079 align:start position:0%
make sure that no children fall through
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
the Gap other states in New England are
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
struggling with the same issue the
 
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
commission's work was focused on one
 
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
basic question if you think of it in
 
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
graphical terms see that New Hampshire
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
line do what we can do to turn it the
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
other way so it looks like Massachusetts
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
line now interestingly representative
 
00:59:21.359 --> 00:59:22.990 align:start position:0%
line now interestingly representative

Heath
 
00:59:25.549 --> 00:59:25.559 align:start position:0%
Manchester is a uniquely potent
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
statistic iCal force in New Hampshire if
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
we solve our Manchester problem which
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
maybe it wasn't intended maybe it was
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
but last session's work I was talking
 
00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:39.160 align:start position:0%
with Mr Sheen kind of
 
00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
got more State dollars to Manchester you
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
can move that line just by that but you
 
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
can't do it on oneoff Lost in the trees
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
detail type of you got to have a
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive approach that applies year
 
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
over-year and allows the state to make
 
00:59:58.990 --> 00:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
sure it's fulfilling its duty to
 
01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
guarantee that every child has an access
 
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
to a good education so chairman luno I
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted to to emphasize that pure
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
that's the policy behind this bill turn
 
01:00:10.319 --> 01:00:11.549 align:start position:0%
that's the policy behind this bill turn
that

01:00:11.549 --> 01:00:11.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
line um page three uh is uh again
 
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
confirms that current law is in New
 
01:00:23.069 --> 01:00:23.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire unfair and regressive what it
 
01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:25.240 align:start position:0%
what that graph shows is that it looks
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
like by population almost all of our
 
01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
school districts are lining up around
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
$4,100 there's a little movement here
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
and there but it's pretty much dead on
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
4100 see that that way they're presented
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
vertically you know why we're
 
01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
Distributing a gigantic chunk of state
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
aid base Aid on a uniform per pupil
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
basis which is not focused on trying to
 
01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
get and make make sure that we're
 
01:00:59.029 --> 01:00:59.039 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing that every child has access
 
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
to a good education regardless of where
 
01:01:05.589 --> 01:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
they live live it is a goal of this bill
 
01:01:05.599 --> 01:01:06.710 align:start position:0%
they live live it is a goal of this bill
to

01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
move that graph so that the the
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
communities that have the lowest
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation per pupil end up
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
receiving greater adequacy a this is one
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
of the key things when a dollar an extra
 
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
goes into
 
01:01:32.109 --> 01:01:32.119 align:start position:0%
Clara it can result in extra extra
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
education spending actually Claremont
 
01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
works really hard to spend money on
 
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
public education or it can result in
 
01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
property tax relief based on the local
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
government decision and so this graph
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
would uh by by getting our Aid to the
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
communities with the greatest challenges
 
01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
including property tax based challenges
 
01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:57.160 align:start position:0%
we achieve not only student Equity we
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
achieve property taxpayer equity and
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
when you throw in the sugar and spice of
 
01:02:05.309 --> 01:02:05.319 align:start position:0%
Representative Ames in enhanced
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
lowincome property taxpayer relief
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
you're starting to really move the ball
 
01:02:11.069 --> 01:02:11.079 align:start position:0%
uh do you have a second for a question
 
01:02:15.029 --> 01:02:15.039 align:start position:0%
yes please cell um just a a question um
 
01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
based on what I think I heard you say um
 
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:21.160 align:start position:0%
every dollar that you add to um The
 
01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
District in Claremont or something um
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
results in property tax relief or
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
education advancement let's say um but
 
01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:33.039 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
requirement that that dollar be spent on
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
academic issues is there I think
 
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli it's a great
 
01:02:47.549 --> 01:02:47.559 align:start position:0%
question and my answer is there is and
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
here's where the requirement is while
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
this bill and I believe the Supreme
 
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
Court has always said that local
 
01:02:57.269 --> 01:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
governance and loal local control is
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
important and is not prohibited by any
 
01:03:03.269 --> 01:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
of the Claremont cases if the local
 
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
government is making
 
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
decisions without a constraint right
 
01:03:11.269 --> 01:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
like you say a direct legal constraint
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
that is directing those dollars all to
 
01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
property tax relief perhaps and maybe
 
01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
even reducing their spending even
 
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
further on public education and then all
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
of a sudden the data comes in that
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
they're failing
 
01:03:31.269 --> 01:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
children because this bill has very uh
 
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
heightened accountability requirements
 
01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
at that point the state's role Rises not
 
01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
before because listen New Hampshire is
 
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
doing pretty good on average we're
 
01:03:47.269 --> 01:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
ranked third in the country in quality
 
01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
but there are places where it's not
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
doing well and so we would the state
 
01:03:54.109 --> 01:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
watches it representative cordelli with
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
the accountability data and if there is
 
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
a community where you pick the failure
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
it could be anything but local
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
governance could be a failure in that
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
case under this bill the state is
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
responsible to step in and take action
 
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure they protect those children
 
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
education sure but in the situation we
 
01:04:19.799 --> 01:04:20.589 align:start position:0%
education sure but in the situation we
have

01:04:20.589 --> 01:04:20.599 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
today um each district gets um adequacy
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
based on the current formula but if you
 
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
take a look at the proficiency scores
 
01:04:34.109 --> 01:04:34.119 align:start position:0%
you know half the kids can't read 40%
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
are proficient in math so you know where
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
is the accountability for there you know
 
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
you would think that the local taxpayers
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
would have something to say about that
 
01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
but uh too often they're not aware I
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
think of the proficiency scores um so
 
01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:52.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure you know where the
 
01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
accountability comes in I'm not sure if
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
the accountability provided for in here
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
is going to make um the difference
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
because in my way of thinking it's more
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
more uh than just the dollars is uh part
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
of uh providing um for greater
 
01:05:17.549 --> 01:05:17.559 align:start position:0%
achievement in our schools I couldn't
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
and I believe the commission couldn't
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
agree more when representative lad is
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
talking about inputs this inputs that
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
this that the a big change as I said to
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
in this approach is to Define
 
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional adequacy in terms of
 
01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
quality and achievement outcomes because
 
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
that allows this information that you
 
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
say sometimes might get lost in our
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
Democratic processes both at the state
 
01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
level and perhaps at the local level not
 
01:05:51.309 --> 01:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
to get lost we want to raise up that
 
01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
information of achievement of
 
01:05:56.589 --> 01:05:56.599 align:start position:0%
performance of gaps and we want the
 
01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
communities to increase the priority of
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
addressing those problems whatever
 
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
system this state adopts for public
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
education it has to be one that
 
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
addresses ultimately the concern that
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
you're talking about but I would just
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
follow on to that saying uh addressing
 
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
those concerns I don't think means uh
 
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
just providing more money to that
 
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
District I agree with that except this
 
01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
that to add this you are right
 
01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
if you look across communities in New
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you will find some communities
 
01:06:34.029 --> 01:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
which have educ uh uh very strong family
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
backgrounds they had I was talking with
 
01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Hall who's so good on this stuff
 
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
uh very strong family backgrounds very
 
01:06:44.109 --> 01:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
high median Family household incomes
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
very strong commitments to education
 
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
those communities naturally through
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
their local government system will tend
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
to create more uh build Public School
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
Systems and it's not necessarily dollars
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
if I could just say that unlike current
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
laws input
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
based calculation of
 
01:07:09.549 --> 01:07:09.559 align:start position:0%
adequacy this bill's determination of
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
adequacy takes those types of Social and
 
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
demographic issues into account for the
 
01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:20.839 align:start position:0%
first time quality matters not just
 
01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
costs and I think representative
 
01:07:26.269 --> 01:07:26.279 align:start position:0%
cordelli if I would say I I've heard the
 
01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
concern that you've expressed expressed
 
01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
many times over my decades working on
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
this issue it is a valid concern and I
 
01:07:36.589 --> 01:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
believe this bill and the commission's
 
01:07:39.269 --> 01:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
work is actually representative Miler
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
said it the entire commission it's time
 
01:07:45.789 --> 01:07:45.799 align:start position:0%
to focus on outcomes and I thought that
 
01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
was a courageous position and and so I
 
01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
think there is a way to come together on
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
this bill um uh in a way that hasn't
 
01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:00.230 align:start position:0%
 
one

01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
more um I'll never forget a um I think
 
01:08:05.269 --> 01:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
it was a book I read and I can't
 
01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:06.799 align:start position:0%
remember the name I wish I could I want
 
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
to get it out of the library again um
 
01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
but the study indicated that um uh
 
01:08:17.229 --> 01:08:17.239 align:start position:0%
students who grew up in a one parent
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
household had um
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
x% possibility of escaping poverty in
 
01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
their lifetime but I think lived in a in
 
01:08:30.829 --> 01:08:30.839 align:start position:0%
a one parent household in a
 
01:08:34.030 --> 01:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of one parent households
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
their chance of escaping poverty was
 
01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
something like in single digits so I'm
 
01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:39.829 align:start position:0%
something like in single digits so I'm
not

01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
sure you know if this formula or any
 
01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
formula is going to address that kind of
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
situation if we really you know want to
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
talk about uh you know what the problems
 
01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
are we want I represent cordelli number
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
one I think this formula in the
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
statistical analysis that helps get to a
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
defined constitutional
 
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
adequacy uh standard in terms of
 
01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
outcomes here does take those factors
 
01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
into account maybe not as much as you
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
like but I would also as you know I've
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
been around a long time and and grew up
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
in Cornish I would I would push back a
 
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
little bit and say I don't think you are
 
01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
saying that a fair Foundation budget to
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
pay for the costs of this of a decent
 
01:09:32.910 --> 01:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
Public School System doesn't have some
 
01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:35.080 align:start position:0%
correlation with student outcomes
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
because that data doesn't exist it's so
 
01:09:41.070 --> 01:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
you got to do all of it I would contend
 
01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:42.390 align:start position:0%
you got to do all of it I would contend
respectfully

01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
respectfully
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
sir it just let me cut in then represent
 
01:09:45.199 --> 01:09:46.590 align:start position:0%
sir it just let me cut in then represent
Myer

01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
Myer
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
um you know I went through a lot of this
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
discussion we're talking how we measure
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
performance outcomes and basically your
 
01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
report this report does it on three
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
factors State uh Statewide assessment
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
assessment graduation rates and
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
attendance those three factors are used
 
01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
within our Ouray right now we have a
 
01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
whole lot of other factors which are
 
01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
indicators of of of doing the job
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
delivering that adequate education and
 
01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:16.280 align:start position:0%
we know them you know going on the
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
pathway CTE attendance military asab all
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
that so there other other measures but
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
if we're looking for some that's very
 
01:10:29.709 --> 01:10:29.719 align:start position:0%
objective these measures you have are
 
01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
objective other words you know they they
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
they lock it in however you know
 
01:10:35.199 --> 01:10:37.270 align:start position:0%
they lock it in however you know
performance

01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
performance
 
01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
outcomes are there performance is also
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
measured and the input
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
system um and and I I I don't think that
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
system should be totally denied uh that
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
we we're looking at technical support
 
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
and supportive support is given to those
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
schools granted there might be high
 
01:10:58.030 --> 01:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
schools that don't receive title $1
 
01:10:59.709 --> 01:10:59.719 align:start position:0%
dollar so they may not be eligible for
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
those dollars but we also have it within
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
State They will receive support so um
 
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
you know I I'm not trying to degreg the
 
01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
report but I'm also saying that the
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
other side of the coin there is
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
accountability and and uh maybe
 
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
structured a little differently so so
 
01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:19.640 align:start position:0%
you know and I'm glad you mentioned that
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
chair lad because um you know that's one
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
of the um I think in uh inconsistencies
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
in our current education funding uh
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
framework and educ uh public school
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
education learning uh instruction
 
01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
delivery framework is that we have uh we
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
have a definition of adequacy in um um
 
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
193 e 198 193 e2a 193 193 e2a
 
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
defines the sub criteria the sub
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
criteria for for delivering inadequate
 
01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
education we've got a costing of an
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
adequate education based on 1500th of a
 
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
principal 130th of a teacher all this
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
other stuff and then we've got an
 
01:12:08.629 --> 01:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
accountability to an adequate education
 
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
that is based to a large degree on
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
outcomes so we have a definition based
 
01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
on um program studies a costing based on
 
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
what's in the bag and an accountability
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
based on how our kids are doing
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
doing and 1586 tightens that up
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
significantly by defining it based on
 
01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
outcomes by costing it based on outcomes
 
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
not based on I'm Sorry by um costing it
 
01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
based on all the for every District
 
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
being able to educate all of its
 
01:12:50.629 --> 01:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
students to a Statewide outcome sorry
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
it's not costed based on outcomes it's
 
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
costed based on getting getting all the
 
01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
students in that District to a Statewide
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
outcome in Manchester those costs are
 
01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
going to be higher highest percentage
 
01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
students living in low-income
 
01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
backgrounds highest number of kids
 
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
English language Learners um all these
 
01:13:10.149 --> 01:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
things very different in Manchester than
 
01:13:10.159 --> 01:13:12.870 align:start position:0%
things very different in Manchester than
in

01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
Handover but then the
 
01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
accountability section of it ties right
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
back into into um achieving that
 
01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide outcome when that
 
01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:25.950 align:start position:0%
Statewide outcome when that
accountability

01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
when when when it's identified that a
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
school district is not meeting that that
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
objective the uh the the
 
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
1586 and the the the formula behind it
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
does not increase the foundation
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget for that District
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't change that as representative
 
01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:45.080 align:start position:0%
cordelli was suggesting throw more money
 
01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
at the problem it doesn't do that there
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
are some federal programs that I think
 
01:13:50.669 --> 01:13:50.679 align:start position:0%
attorney valinsky talked about those
 
01:13:53.189 --> 01:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
yesterday that do you know provide
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
additional funds but the state is not is
 
01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
not doing that through the provisions in
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
in 1586 the state is then as as attorney
 
01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
arer has has said then providing those
 
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
districts with some expert help from the
 
01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
from the state those superintendents
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
those principles um here here's here's
 
01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
what this District very similar is doing
 
01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of programs in terms of uh
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
Extended Learning opportunities in terms
 
01:14:22.629 --> 01:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
of outside of school enrichment
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
activities that are helping to get them
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
where they're going and the information
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
that's collected by the department um
 
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
through the accountability section 15 86
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
allows them to have that information and
 
01:14:39.189 --> 01:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
be able to share that information with
 
01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
uh with districts that are struggling so
 
01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not pumping pumping more
 
01:14:47.070 --> 01:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
cash into the foundation opportunity
 
01:14:51.149 --> 01:14:51.159 align:start position:0%
budget repent I first thank you Mr chair
 
01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
I just want to emphasize the fact that
 
01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
what I I what I think people need to
 
01:14:59.470 --> 01:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
realize is that this program really
 
01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
emphasizes the issue of quality and
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
outcomes uh our current program doesn't
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
do that it just says well you know
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
here's a bunch of money we're going to
 
01:15:11.709 --> 01:15:11.719 align:start position:0%
just send it here and I think for school
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
districts it's going to be a terrific
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
challenge for the first time to
 
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
basically come forward and say okay here
 
01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
are here's our goals are we meeting them
 
01:15:23.189 --> 01:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
or are we not meeting them the other
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
thing that I think I I want to emphasize
 
01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
centered student
 
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
centered because it's focused on how
 
01:15:37.629 --> 01:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
kids are going to be performing in that
 
01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
school district and that's something
 
01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
that the current formula does not
 
01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
address as it relates to how students
 
01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
are in fact doing and so that's I think
 
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
those two issues for making sure that
 
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
they're meeting their objectives if
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
they're not then they get some
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
assistance and that it is focused on how
 
01:15:59.550 --> 01:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
students are doing in the school
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
districts thank
 
01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
you represent dry then represent
 
01:16:08.629 --> 01:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
represent dry thank you Mr chairman
 
01:16:11.709 --> 01:16:11.719 align:start position:0%
um if the answer
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
to a school that's not meeting the
 
01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
accountability is to give them help
 
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
provide them help one that doesn't come
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
with no cost I'm assuming but also are
 
01:16:26.669 --> 01:16:26.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
are we doing that at all right now
 
01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
that's a great question because I don't
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
know to what extent the department is
 
01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
collecting that information with which
 
01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:41.239 align:start position:0%
to say all right and you know District a
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
um you're you're you're underperforming
 
01:16:46.629 --> 01:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
but I know what district you know B is
 
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
doing and very similar District to you
 
01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
here's what you can do to help um I
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
would I'm I'm sure that
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
um that you know if um if Nate green
 
01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
were here he'd be able to talk about uh
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
you know what the what the department is
 
01:17:06.669 --> 01:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
uh is doing right now but given the fact
 
01:17:09.550 --> 01:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
given the fact that that we've got
 
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
districts such as Newcastle where the
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
average student in Newcastle is
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
performing at the 84th percentile of all
 
01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:20.030 align:start position:0%
performing at the 84th percentile of all
students

01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
Statewide and we've got the average
 
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
student in Manchester and I hate picking
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
on manchest but it's our largest
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
District um with a lot of challenges
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
where the average student in Manchester
 
01:17:34.629 --> 01:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
is per performing at the fifth
 
01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
percentile of all students
 
01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide that whatever the department
 
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
is doing to try to provide some student
 
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
equity and some some some commonality
 
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
with with student the average student
 
01:17:52.270 --> 01:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
outcome in Manchester shouldn't be that
 
01:17:53.709 --> 01:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
different than the average student
 
01:17:58.030 --> 01:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
I mean it shouldn't be all that
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
different um uh there's going to be
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
little differences but
 
01:18:09.149 --> 01:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
but it shouldn't be so
 
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
so extreme right now than what that when
 
01:18:14.830 --> 01:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
you look at where the average student is
 
01:18:18.629 --> 01:18:18.639 align:start position:0%
Manchester against 165,000 or 160,000
 
01:18:21.310 --> 01:18:21.320 align:start position:0%
kids K12 public schools and they're
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
performing 90 95% of those kids are
 
01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
performing better than than student
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
number SE student number 650 I'm sorry
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
6,500 in the um in the Manchester
 
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
schools I think I think what we ought to
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
do is try to move on here
 
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
and I think we can argue this case you
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
know this particular situation yes we
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of poverty
 
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
communities out there and we know
 
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
there's a direct relationship between
 
01:18:53.629 --> 01:18:53.639 align:start position:0%
achievement and and that that that um
 
01:18:55.149 --> 01:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
and we have some issues we have some
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
issues in the present formula uh with
 
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
the lack of fiscal capacity topar 8 uh
 
01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
but um I think that to address this um
 
01:19:07.149 --> 01:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
it's going to be quite a lengthy topic
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
here because this is probably Pro a
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
foundational uh uh element that has
 
01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
brought all this about is that we have
 
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
property poor towns which aren't putting
 
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
the product out
 
01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
that for example graduation rate in the
 
01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
state is around 92% it's pretty good
 
01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
it's up in the top but if you take the
 
01:19:29.709 --> 01:19:29.719 align:start position:0%
district you've just been talking about
 
01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
there's some high schools high school
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
that has a 58% graduation
 
01:19:37.709 --> 01:19:37.719 align:start position:0%
rate and um that that is a concern and
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
an issue Mr Mr Cher let me follow and
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
take just one more slide and then let
 
01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
the I will step aside and let the
 
01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
commission just to follow what uh
 
01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
representative luno asked me to do let's
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
move the ball I agree uh one last slide
 
01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:56.719 align:start position:0%
page seven it's a picture picture's
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
worth a thousand
 
01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
words this bill when we put together the
 
01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
financial spreadsheets and if you
 
01:20:09.229 --> 01:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
haven't done an Excel spreadsheet for
 
01:20:09.239 --> 01:20:10.229 align:start position:0%
haven't done an Excel spreadsheet for
the

01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
240 uh districts with all of these I
 
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
urge you to do it because I contend that
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
you can't really understand the impacts
 
01:20:20.830 --> 01:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
of Ed funding reform until you've done a
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet like that um when we did the
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
spread sheet we knew that what the
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
current system does is in the top graph
 
01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
it has everybody receiving about the
 
01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
same amount of money per
 
01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
pupil regardless of their equalized
 
01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:41.830 align:start position:0%
pupil regardless of their equalized
valuation

01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
valuation
 
01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
differences but when this machine in
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
1586 was turned on in a
 
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
model the result would be a distribution
 
01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
of Aid that's shown in Green in the
 
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
bottom graph that shows stretching the
 
01:21:04.750 --> 01:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
communities so that those with the
 
01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.110 align:start position:0%
communities so that those with the
greatest

01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
greatest
 
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
challenges are getting the greatest
 
01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
support uh represent of heat it is not
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
picking on Manchester the state's Duty
 
01:21:16.990 --> 01:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
under Claremont
 
01:21:22.189 --> 01:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
one is to take a very cleare eyed look
 
01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
where are our problems and means looking
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
hard and frankly every family in
 
01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester should not View and teacher
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
an administrator should not view this as
 
01:21:35.189 --> 01:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
critical should view it as the state
 
01:21:39.709 --> 01:21:39.719 align:start position:0%
finally stepping up to its duty to help
 
01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:42.199 align:start position:0%
the districts with greatest need that I
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
don't think we need to go as chairman L
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
and and it should be obvious from these
 
01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
graphs the biggest bubble on here is
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester the second bubble is nashille
 
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
and so you can see you can see what what
 
01:21:58.189 --> 01:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
1586 does for
 
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
moving these Bubbles and and and
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
aligning them where um where where uh
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
based on based on their challenges and
 
01:22:11.709 --> 01:22:11.719 align:start position:0%
needs and as attorney AR said their
 
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
capacity to to meet their own needs so
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
so um so and that's that's very much
 
01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
tied in with the uh with the with the
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
funding so what what what attorney
 
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
ardinger is talking this is the costing
 
01:22:29.629 --> 01:22:29.639 align:start position:0%
part of it this has nothing to do with
 
01:22:32.189 --> 01:22:32.199 align:start position:0%
funny this is costing what a foundation
 
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget would look like for
 
01:22:38.030 --> 01:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
these different districts um when we get
 
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
to the funding uh side of it and um and
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
I think we could probably even shift
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
into doing um
 
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
u a quick summary of the funding so
 
01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
we've got the foundation opportunity
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
budgets if you look on page 10 uh they
 
01:22:57.149 --> 01:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
are set by the formula in the to achieve
 
01:22:59.189 --> 01:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
the equity results by the way just to
 
01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
let you know the five plaintiff towns in
 
01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
the original claron action which
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
includes uh uh all do significantly
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
better under this approach than they do
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
under current
 
01:23:18.510 --> 01:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
law um the the funding for these budgets
 
01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
the foundation opportunity budget comes
 
01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
from two
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
sources a minimum local
 
01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
contribution that is
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
mandated and a state Foundation
 
01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
Opportunity Grant those two integrated
 
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
sources hit the foundation budget
 
01:23:42.430 --> 01:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
established for every Community as as he
 
01:23:46.510 --> 01:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
said the foundation budget is is greater
 
01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
in the communities with the greatest
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
challenges so those two sources now this
 
01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:23:55.390 --> 01:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
controversial piece as as we talked
 
01:23:57.790 --> 01:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
about yesterday at the hearing the
 
01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
question has been raised whether this
 
01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:03.030 align:start position:0%
question has been raised whether this
integrated

01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
integrated
 
01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
mandated funding system mandated by
 
01:24:11.550 --> 01:24:11.560 align:start position:0%
state law whether it is consistent with
 
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
with language in court cases in the
 
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
Claremont line and I think that's a fair
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
question but I also contend that the
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
courts decisions have never said that
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
there can't be a substantial role for
 
01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:32.719 align:start position:0%
local governments and local
 
01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
contribution and therefore the test as I
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
think I don't believe the court has ever
 
01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
been presented with a fully completed
 
01:24:45.229 --> 01:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
integrated quality-based
 
01:24:47.790 --> 01:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
answer to defining constitutional
 
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
adequacy and guaranteeing funding for it
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
like this bill and because this bill
 
01:24:55.950 --> 01:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
achieves in its
 
01:24:59.470 --> 01:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
intent very good policy goals that I
 
01:25:01.229 --> 01:25:01.239 align:start position:0%
believe were consistent with the
 
01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
original intent of the five poor school
 
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
districts that challenge the state's
 
01:25:10.830 --> 01:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
lack of Duty in 19 in in that resulted
 
01:25:13.310 --> 01:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
in the Claremont one decision I think
 
01:25:16.270 --> 01:25:16.280 align:start position:0%
the court uh it it's difficult to say
 
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
how the court would come out on this um
 
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
there's it is a fair question I don't
 
01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
want anyone to think I'm saying that I I
 
01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:26.360 align:start position:0%
know the language but the there's
 
01:25:29.070 --> 01:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
conflicting language in my view as one
 
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
attorney and I don't think the court has
 
01:25:34.270 --> 01:25:34.280 align:start position:0%
ruled on something like this so those
 
01:25:37.709 --> 01:25:37.719 align:start position:0%
were the two funding sources and minimum
 
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
local contribution is defined in the
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
bill guess what as representative luno
 
01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
says it needs to be adjusted to fit with
 
01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0%
current valuations which are
 
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
substantially higher after the this was
 
01:25:51.149 --> 01:25:51.159 align:start position:0%
done preco it needs to be adjusted to
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
get it right but the bottom line goal
 
01:25:56.109 --> 01:25:56.119 align:start position:0%
after this is all done is to get the
 
01:25:59.070 --> 01:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
state contribution to the total $3.5
 
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
billion nut up to get the total
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
allocation of the 40% State 60% uh Lo
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
local to get it more fairly
 
01:26:15.070 --> 01:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
distributed and to have an ironclad
 
01:26:18.270 --> 01:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
transparent production of data that
 
01:26:21.629 --> 01:26:21.639 align:start position:0%
allows people to say we have opportunity
 
01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
gaps that we need to address
 
01:26:26.830 --> 01:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
right great thank thank you very much
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
for the chance thank you for the chance
 
01:26:31.229 --> 01:26:31.239 align:start position:0%
to sit with you oh great always always a
 
01:26:31.239 --> 01:26:32.790 align:start position:0%
to sit with you oh great always always a
pleasure

01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
pleasure
 
01:26:35.229 --> 01:26:35.239 align:start position:0%
bill so I got a question for you before
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
you hit the Horizon here um the the the
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
costing of this is built around the uh
 
01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
average cost of a student here in the
 
01:26:46.709 --> 01:26:46.719 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is that
 
01:26:49.629 --> 01:26:49.639 align:start position:0%
correct the costing of this is is built
 
01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
around not the average cost of a of a
 
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
student it's built around what what
 
01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
districts are currently spending how
 
01:26:58.390 --> 01:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
they're spending it and how their
 
01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
students what their student outcomes are
 
01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
and then by looking at that data over a
 
01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:06.280 align:start position:0%
10-year period the um the folks that we'
 
01:27:08.669 --> 01:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
contracted with on the commission the
 
01:27:10.629 --> 01:27:10.639 align:start position:0%
the um the researchers from the American
 
01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
institutes for research um studied how
 
01:27:18.669 --> 01:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
that spending tied into student outcomes
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
and they also uh they also looked at
 
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
what the student and the district
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
characteristics were for each of those
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
school districts because just like what
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
we were talking about earlier with
 
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
Manchester um uh there are there are
 
01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
things that clearly Drive um costs for
 
01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
educ the doe 25 form reflects expenses
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
of of all the
 
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
districts and would the exclusion where
 
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
we take out the cost tuition and
 
01:27:53.470 --> 01:27:53.480 align:start position:0%
transportation that's separate that's
 
01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
disaggregate from this whole thing so we
 
01:27:58.669 --> 01:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
have the remaining
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
expenses would this be uh would would
 
01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
the your formula Your Foundation program
 
01:28:10.350 --> 01:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
here benefit from us better knowing what
 
01:28:14.910 --> 01:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
expenses within the doe 25 form are
 
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary to fill an adequate
 
01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
education the academic side not all
 
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
those other expens which are nonrelated
 
01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
to the program and you know I've
 
01:28:29.950 --> 01:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned it before why are we putting
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
the expense of of the the marching B
 
01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
marching band into that sheet can we
 
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
take that stuff out and then find out
 
01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
what the real average cost is so so just
 
01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
to be clear we're not putting the
 
01:28:44.350 --> 01:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
marching band or the football team into
 
01:28:47.310 --> 01:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
that sheet but I think you could
 
01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
probably ask superintendant across the
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
state and they'd say and and you'd ask
 
01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
them why do you have a football team or
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
why do you have a robotics program um
 
01:28:59.350 --> 01:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
and I think a lot of them would would
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
answer because that's what gets kids to
 
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
come through the door in the morning and
 
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
it's so that that that alone keeping
 
01:29:10.109 --> 01:29:10.119 align:start position:0%
kids engaged having signed that that
 
01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
that contract saying that that you will
 
01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
be there during the school day um and
 
01:29:18.109 --> 01:29:18.119 align:start position:0%
that's what makes you eligible for to
 
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
practice and to play for a lot of kids
 
01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
that's a um that's a critical um part of
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
their education
 
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
and we hear it all the time at at I'm
 
01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
not meln I'm not a big um college
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
football um you know Watcher but they
 
01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
talk about how how football saved them
 
01:29:37.390 --> 01:29:37.400 align:start position:0%
football got them through their
 
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
education I'm not a football player but
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh and I never thought I'd be sitting
 
01:29:44.109 --> 01:29:44.119 align:start position:0%
here you know in the State House talking
 
01:29:45.790 --> 01:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
about why football is so important I'm
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
picking an extreme example on this
 
01:29:51.189 --> 01:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
notice I'm not saying turf field I'm not
 
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
saying things like like that but a lot
 
01:29:57.189 --> 01:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
of these programs are part of the um of
 
01:29:59.229 --> 01:29:59.239 align:start position:0%
the K12 experience whether it's early
 
01:30:02.990 --> 01:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
enrichment programs whether it's um um
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
um uh uh U inter Scholastic um organized
 
01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
Sports at the JV and high school level
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
at the middle school level uh uh these
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
are all part I think of the of the they
 
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
tie right in with the um with the the
 
01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
the core elements in 193 e2a currently
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
for for you know Wellness education
 
01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
things like that they're certainly
 
01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:29.560 align:start position:0%
consistent with um with that are there
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
some expenses that districts take on
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
that don't result in um or that don't
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
drive student outcomes sure absolutely
 
01:30:41.070 --> 01:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
and um when uh when the when the when
 
01:30:43.870 --> 01:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
the commission researchers did the work
 
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
those amounts were discounted out and
 
01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:47.560 align:start position:0%
and they were taken out through through
 
01:30:50.350 --> 01:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
an efficiency so so I'm just follow up
 
01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
tonight I don't want to hog up here but
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
so we have specific inputs our formula
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
right now which states these are the the
 
01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
areas which are necessary to fulfill Our
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
obligation Alan adquate education why
 
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
can't those inputs be also put into the
 
01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
back end of the formula you're talking
 
01:31:11.310 --> 01:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
about where when I'm looking for a
 
01:31:12.910 --> 01:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
certified math teacher I'm not looking
 
01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
for a certified may maybe that can also
 
01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
do football because it's a separate
 
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
stype and a separate contract than the
 
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
contract to
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
teach what I I'm just concerned that you
 
01:31:26.109 --> 01:31:26.119 align:start position:0%
know some
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
some when I I look at Keem for example
 
01:31:31.149 --> 01:31:31.159 align:start position:0%
right now they'll think well maybe we'll
 
01:31:32.990 --> 01:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
have a hockey program over there maybe
 
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
that'll attract kids to the
 
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
Keen system which they're looking at but
 
01:31:40.109 --> 01:31:40.119 align:start position:0%
that's not going to contribute to the
 
01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
music program the fine music program and
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
fine theater programs that they are
 
01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
known for or their teacher prep programs
 
01:31:49.709 --> 01:31:49.719 align:start position:0%
which they're well known for so I'm I'm
 
01:31:52.350 --> 01:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
concerned that and and I'll be right out
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
front right now I concern support much
 
01:31:56.990 --> 01:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
of what came out of that report however
 
01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
I do not like the aspect of costing this
 
01:32:03.109 --> 01:32:03.119 align:start position:0%
thing at a certain cost based upon that
 
01:32:07.109 --> 01:32:07.119 align:start position:0%
Doe 25 form which is not even audited by
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
all districts that you're receiving the
 
01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
doe and we're taking that number and
 
01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
saying that's what it costs to educate a
 
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
kid and um I think if we could take out
 
01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
and put in the the components which
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
contribute to adequacy then I'd be with
 
01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
it so so I I agree with you that that I
 
01:32:28.510 --> 01:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
think the components that contribute for
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
adequacy need to uh need to be in
 
01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
1932a and and um and 1586 does amend
 
01:32:39.870 --> 01:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
those out and I think that those core
 
01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
those core um elements of adequacy do
 
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
need to be contained in there we just
 
01:32:47.109 --> 01:32:47.119 align:start position:0%
added personal financial literacy and
 
01:32:49.629 --> 01:32:49.639 align:start position:0%
and um um and I think did we add
 
01:32:52.350 --> 01:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
computer literacy last year yes as well
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
coup that that both those along with
 
01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
along with those other elements U need
 
01:32:59.470 --> 01:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
to remain remain in there so I think
 
01:33:03.149 --> 01:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
there is the ability to do a hybrid uh
 
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh approach to how you define adequacy
 
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
but having that tight relationship
 
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
between accountability and adequacy in
 
01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
terms of student performance this is
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
what I've heard ever since my first year
 
01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
on the education committee where where
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
where everybody wants to know how our
 
01:33:25.550 --> 01:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
students are doing and and what can we
 
01:33:30.030 --> 01:33:30.040 align:start position:0%
do to to to make sure that uh that that
 
01:33:33.109 --> 01:33:33.119 align:start position:0%
student performance student outcomes are
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
strong in each of our districts if we're
 
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
not um if we're not measuring that and
 
01:33:39.149 --> 01:33:39.159 align:start position:0%
well we are measuring that through
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
through you know standardized testing
 
01:33:43.470 --> 01:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
but also adding graduation rates adding
 
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
attendance rates but and have that in
 
01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
have that feedback loop integral to the
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
accountability going right back to the
 
01:33:56.669 --> 01:33:56.679 align:start position:0%
the um the adequate education as long as
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
the costing of that of an adequate
 
01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
education is based on the definition of
 
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
an adequate education and the feedback
 
01:34:06.750 --> 01:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
loop um ties back to that then I think
 
01:34:09.550 --> 01:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
we've got a good integrated system that
 
01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
can be measured monitor monitored and um
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
and and have the element that that
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative dry was saying how can
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
the department make sure that it can
 
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
help these districts uh improve their
 
01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
student outcomes and before you leave
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
can you please explain how the weighted
 
01:34:29.149 --> 01:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
formulas within all this work you know
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
because you have certain categories in
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
your blue book there I don't Bill's got
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
a head out so okay yeah so hitting the
 
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
road okay yeah why why don't we why
 
01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
don't we let let attorney ardinger go
 
01:34:43.950 --> 01:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
with with our deep thanks thank you this
 
01:34:46.189 --> 01:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
is such an important issue for the state
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
ATT uh representative lad the the the
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
issues you're talking about the the one
 
01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
thing I hear in it is I I think what
 
01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
this bill does in one part is respect
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
local governance and local control first
 
01:35:05.310 --> 01:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
and so it allows because nothing if you
 
01:35:07.149 --> 01:35:07.159 align:start position:0%
look at your communities yeah main
 
01:35:10.030 --> 01:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
Street's really important institutions
 
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
like religious institutions are
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
important to building Community um you
 
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
know youth baseball and hockey and other
 
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
activity programs YMCA is important to
 
01:35:22.830 --> 01:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
communities but perhaps nothing's more
 
01:35:27.109 --> 01:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
important to building Community than our
 
01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
common schools our Public Schools what
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
you're doing is so important and I I
 
01:35:34.750 --> 01:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
promise you I I want it to the extent
 
01:35:36.189 --> 01:35:36.199 align:start position:0%
you guys will have me I want to
 
01:35:38.709 --> 01:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
participate in it try and join you in
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
that effort I would just say that the
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
one thing I would urge you to be you
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
don't ever want to be so prescriptive in
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
my view just one person Not Elected I
 
01:35:54.030 --> 01:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
was one time not now is is to be so so
 
01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
prescriptive that your local governance
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
system can't have a good debate over
 
01:36:00.990 --> 01:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
whether the Strings
 
01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:03.679 align:start position:0%
program is something that really adds to
 
01:36:05.790 --> 01:36:05.800 align:start position:0%
the student achievement and and I think
 
01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
Dave's your comments were like this or
 
01:36:12.189 --> 01:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
or the football program or the AP
 
01:36:14.590 --> 01:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
programs you got to let those
 
01:36:16.750 --> 01:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
superintendents those administrators
 
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
those teachers those parents battle it
 
01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
out a little bit locally and yes every
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
District's going to make different
 
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
valuations decisions but through that
 
01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
process as long as the state has the
 
01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
data we can make sure that none of those
 
01:36:34.109 --> 01:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
decisions are undermining the state's
 
01:36:36.430 --> 01:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
Duty under Claremont one to guarantee
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
that every kid has a fair Shake thank so
 
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:45.870 --> 01:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
you so you want to talk about the um the
 
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
weights so let's um let's go to the
 
01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
bill and let's um actually uh we get to
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
the weights after the first two pages um
 
01:36:59.070 --> 01:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
do you want me to just start right well
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
just just go into it just spend spend it
 
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
is a it's a new component which
 
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
we haven't built our previous program on
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
well there it's it's a new component but
 
01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
it looks very similar actually so but
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
how we go about calculating those
 
01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
weights is is actually based on evidence
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
as as opposed to a little B we did have
 
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
certain weights for example an f&amp;r in
 
01:37:27.229 --> 01:37:27.239 align:start position:0%
the 2008
 
01:37:31.149 --> 01:37:31.159 align:start position:0%
model uh on the fiscal capacity um it
 
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
got to the point where if you had over
 
01:37:36.229 --> 01:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
40 48% of the kids which were free
 
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
reduced meals you got a double in terms
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
$3,456 you got close to Seven Grand uh
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
on top of your base cost
 
01:37:49.709 --> 01:37:49.719 align:start position:0%
that that really certainly would help a
 
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
town like yours um I'm also concern at
 
01:37:56.350 --> 01:37:56.360 align:start position:0%
that time when we were doing that did
 
01:37:57.870 --> 01:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
the achievement scores look any
 
01:38:00.270 --> 01:38:00.280 align:start position:0%
different than they are now that was
 
01:38:02.589 --> 01:38:02.599 align:start position:0%
more money being put to these districts
 
01:38:05.550 --> 01:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
but see and and so when a when a when a
 
01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
district and and actually newport's sort
 
01:38:10.709 --> 01:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
of a great example of this and in
 
01:38:13.390 --> 01:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
Manchester is a good example of this too
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
um when a when a district works as hard
 
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
as they
 
01:38:22.030 --> 01:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
can to to fund their local school budget
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
but they can't get there they can't
 
01:38:27.070 --> 01:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
address the needs that uh that the
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
school has we heard about the needs that
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
that there are up in Newport um and I
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
mean it was it was uh I hadn't even
 
01:38:36.589 --> 01:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
realized that and I use Newport as an
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
example all the time um but when when
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
when Newport which I think has the
 
01:38:44.430 --> 01:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
highest or second highest local
 
01:38:47.790 --> 01:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
education property tax rate can't hit a
 
01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
budget number anywhere close to what I
 
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
mean to what other districts in the area
 
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire throughout New
 
01:38:57.629 --> 01:38:57.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are getting and they're and
 
01:39:00.109 --> 01:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
they're working super hard to get there
 
01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
then you know something's wrong with the
 
01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh with the way that we're we're funding
 
01:39:06.589 --> 01:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
schools and and I think the other thing
 
01:39:09.589 --> 01:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
you need to that that represent lad that
 
01:39:11.950 --> 01:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
you that you talk about here is that
 
01:39:15.669 --> 01:39:15.679 align:start position:0%
when when we look at the uh the weights
 
01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
the weights aren't
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
grants currently the weights that we
 
01:39:21.470 --> 01:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
have in our funding
 
01:39:25.870 --> 01:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
formula that's State Grant do
 
01:39:29.109 --> 01:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
right that defines the cost of an
 
01:39:32.910 --> 01:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
adequate education and the State dollars
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
come in as the first dollars to fund
 
01:39:40.030 --> 01:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
that adequate education what we're doing
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
with 15 in
 
01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
1586 as as opposed to using the formula
 
01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
for funding it's used for costing so now
 
01:39:51.669 --> 01:39:51.679 align:start position:0%
we're costing inadequate education in
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
terms of what district superintendent
 
01:39:56.589 --> 01:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
would look at and say yeah that's pretty
 
01:40:00.189 --> 01:40:00.199 align:start position:0%
CL that's pretty close to um to what it
 
01:40:03.149 --> 01:40:03.159 align:start position:0%
would cost to uh to put on an adequate
 
01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
education here in Manchester here in
 
01:40:08.910 --> 01:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield here in Newport in Claremont
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
H Berlin wherever you happen uh happen
 
01:40:14.189 --> 01:40:14.199 align:start position:0%
to be and I think you know Jen Gillis in
 
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
Manchester superintendent Manchester
 
01:40:18.189 --> 01:40:18.199 align:start position:0%
would would probably look at could
 
01:40:21.310 --> 01:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
probably look at um at hopkinson's
 
01:40:23.589 --> 01:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
budget and say well even though if we
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
scaled it up based on the number of
 
01:40:27.149 --> 01:40:27.159 align:start position:0%
students that's not the cost of an
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
adequate education in New Hampshire
 
01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
because Hopkin doesn't have very many
 
01:40:35.669 --> 01:40:35.679 align:start position:0%
elll you know English language Learners
 
01:40:38.910 --> 01:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
um uh in our district we hopkington has
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
about a thousand kids in our district
 
01:40:44.910 --> 01:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester has a thousand homeless kids
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
in their District so I mean the
 
01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
challenges are completely different and
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
so so so the the the the the costing
 
01:41:00.189 --> 01:41:00.199 align:start position:0%
formula which which begins on page
 
01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
four uh is is is based on the experience
 
01:41:07.149 --> 01:41:07.159 align:start position:0%
that all of these districts have had
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
what the unique student characteristics
 
01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
are and in particular I mean you can you
 
01:41:14.709 --> 01:41:14.719 align:start position:0%
can see right um starting with with line
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
eight um uh the number of St students so
 
01:41:21.589 --> 01:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
ad everybody here knows adma we've gone
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
to admr now right so these are all
 
01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
things that need to be changed in this
 
01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
spill but free introduce price lunch
 
01:41:32.510 --> 01:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
engl line 10 English language
 
01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
learns also in our current in our
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
current funding formula that's those are
 
01:41:41.550 --> 01:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
there um line 12 the number of students
 
01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
in special education services um
 
01:41:46.270 --> 01:41:46.280 align:start position:0%
representative lad talked about maybe
 
01:41:47.550 --> 01:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
breaking that out into three
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
classifications I think that makes a lot
 
01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:51.719 align:start position:0%
of sense and we can figure out what the
 
01:41:54.189 --> 01:41:54.199 align:start position:0%
weights would be in order to uh to
 
01:41:58.910 --> 01:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
determine that and then um um the um uh
 
01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
line 14 and then the group of lines
 
01:42:04.589 --> 01:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
below that size of the district and
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
there's different different weights um
 
01:42:09.229 --> 01:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
according to that now once you've gone
 
01:42:11.709 --> 01:42:11.719 align:start position:0%
the size of the district does that take
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
into account to the number of kids which
 
01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
are the size of District some districts
 
01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
are k through eight y uh so does that
 
01:42:19.470 --> 01:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
take is there a funding mechanism there
 
01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
a wait for the the uh grade levels does
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
down in aliance 26 and 28 yeah um you
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
have grade level uh funding and that all
 
01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
gets built into this so all of this is
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
aggregated to come up to a foundation
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
operate opportunity budget the cost for
 
01:42:40.709 --> 01:42:40.719 align:start position:0%
the school district to educate all of
 
01:42:43.310 --> 01:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
its students to to a Statewide average
 
01:42:46.669 --> 01:42:46.679 align:start position:0%
out so it's calibrated based based on
 
01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
that uh it should be re-calibrated every
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
six years in the bill it says no no less
 
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
frequently than every 10 years thinking
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
now it should be done every six years to
 
01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
recalculate that represent casan um
 
01:43:04.589 --> 01:43:04.599 align:start position:0%
while you're in that part of the bill my
 
01:43:06.910 --> 01:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
question was about line
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
29 where this bill has the universal
 
01:43:11.950 --> 01:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
base Foundation opportunity cost should
 
01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:12.870 align:start position:0%
base Foundation opportunity cost should
equal

01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
equal
 
01:43:15.709 --> 01:43:15.719 align:start position:0%
651 that that's considered the
 
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
base so should that change based on the
 
01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
recent conval decision on what judge
 
01:43:27.229 --> 01:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
ruoff recommended as a minimum that's a
 
01:43:30.030 --> 01:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
great question represent Cas scen um I
 
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
would I would say that well let me say
 
01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:33.750 align:start position:0%
would I would say that well let me say
how

01:43:33.750 --> 01:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:43:37.790 --> 01:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
$65,000 I'm $6,500 was arrived at was
 
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
was through the work that that we did
 
01:43:42.310 --> 01:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
with the um with Drew ainson and Bruce
 
01:43:46.830 --> 01:43:46.840 align:start position:0%
Baker at uh at air and basically
 
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
$6,500 was what was left over after you
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
take out all of these other components
 
01:43:54.589 --> 01:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
for you to do special education English
 
01:43:56.589 --> 01:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
language learner size of school grade
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
range stuff like that so uh very much I
 
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
think in line with with with what um uh
 
01:44:05.310 --> 01:44:05.320 align:start position:0%
with what we heard yesterday in one of
 
01:44:07.870 --> 01:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
the bills this is the cost for the
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
imaginary student that doesn't even walk
 
01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
through a school door because doesn't
 
01:44:15.310 --> 01:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
have size the school and all all that in
 
01:44:17.629 --> 01:44:17.639 align:start position:0%
there so this it's it's the cost of a
 
01:44:21.709 --> 01:44:21.719 align:start position:0%
student that doesn't really exist um uh
 
01:44:24.270 --> 01:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
should it be adjusted
 
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
I think 6500 is actually very consistent
 
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
because this number does not include
 
01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
Transportation the
 
01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
7400 uh does include Transportation it's
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
$1,400 so so the um the conv Val base
 
01:44:43.709 --> 01:44:43.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
$6,000 the um the
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
6501 and I and and I'm sorry to jump
 
01:44:53.709 --> 01:44:53.719 align:start position:0%
ahead but if you turn to the next page
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
um the bill so down at the bottom on
 
01:44:58.669 --> 01:44:58.679 align:start position:0%
lines 28 through
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
36 um has a um has
 
01:45:04.589 --> 01:45:04.599 align:start position:0%
a sure I'm on the right section here
 
01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
yeah um has a transition period so we
 
01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
don't bring it in at a 100% in the first
 
01:45:13.390 --> 01:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
year um uh back when this bill was
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
originally written it was we were
 
01:45:18.430 --> 01:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
looking at a 7-year transition period uh
 
01:45:20.350 --> 01:45:20.360 align:start position:0%
I would like to propose a 5-year
 
01:45:22.629 --> 01:45:22.639 align:start position:0%
transition period where we begin the
 
01:45:22.639 --> 01:45:23.550 align:start position:0%
transition period where we begin the
first

01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:45:27.189 --> 01:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
year at 80% of the 6501 and everything
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
is built all the weights are all built
 
01:45:33.149 --> 01:45:33.159 align:start position:0%
off the the the base number
 
01:45:37.709 --> 01:45:37.719 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to being uh direct dollars
 
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a multiplier on the base so
 
01:45:44.430 --> 01:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
so you'd see ABC and
 
01:45:48.589 --> 01:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
D at the bottom of page five go from 80%
 
01:45:54.030 --> 01:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
to 85% 90% 95% and then online 36 for
 
01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2030 and later 100% so it'
 
01:45:58.229 --> 01:45:58.239 align:start position:0%
be a has there been a spreadsheet
 
01:45:59.910 --> 01:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
developed for this what's that has there
 
01:46:01.709 --> 01:46:01.719 align:start position:0%
been we're working with Mark on that
 
01:46:04.189 --> 01:46:04.199 align:start position:0%
right now has he given us a well he'll
 
01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
be this afternoon have we got a timeline
 
01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
when that might be available U we can
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
talk with Mark about that but but it
 
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
he's he's very he's he's still work
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
tweaking some things he's got some
 
01:46:18.270 --> 01:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
things that uh that he talked about that
 
01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
that I mean Mark comes from the LBA
 
01:46:24.149 --> 01:46:24.159 align:start position:0%
School of spread spr sheet design which
 
01:46:25.830 --> 01:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
means you've got to be down to the penny
 
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
accurate and um and I and I said well
 
01:46:30.589 --> 01:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
Mark for some of these things I'd be I'd
 
01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
be happy you know with the Barn Door
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
sort of accuracy knowing that we're
 
01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
really close so that from a policy
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
perspective we can discuss these things
 
01:46:40.109 --> 01:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
I think he wants to get down to the
 
01:46:42.910 --> 01:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
penny which I appreciate his uh his his
 
01:46:45.910 --> 01:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
level of diligence on on that um but
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
let's let's talk with him about that
 
01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
this afternoon that's on the docket and
 
01:46:51.149 --> 01:46:51.159 align:start position:0%
I and I've talked with him about some of
 
01:46:54.589 --> 01:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
these uh changes mhm um and we can get
 
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
into to to some more
 
01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
let's if it's all right I I'd like to
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
sort of keep going and and and you know
 
01:47:07.109 --> 01:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
we've talked about how we build out the
 
01:47:10.229 --> 01:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget based on
 
01:47:10.239 --> 01:47:11.350 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget based on
the

01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:16.629 --> 01:47:16.639 align:start position:0%
65 6501 base and then these multipliers
 
01:47:19.229 --> 01:47:19.239 align:start position:0%
to that base for the different uh
 
01:47:21.870 --> 01:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
student and District characteristics
 
01:47:25.390 --> 01:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
that still has not resulted in a dollar
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
of State funds going to anybody this is
 
01:47:30.149 --> 01:47:30.159 align:start position:0%
just determining the foundation
 
01:47:32.229 --> 01:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget what a district
 
01:47:32.239 --> 01:47:34.310 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget what a district
should

01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:47:37.070 --> 01:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
spend to educate all of its students to
 
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
a Statewide average outcome it's a
 
01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
strong outcome nationally a strong
 
01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:44.910 align:start position:0%
strong outcome nationally a strong
outcome

01:47:44.910 --> 01:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
01:47:50.109 --> 01:47:50.119 align:start position:0%
um the the next page um page
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
six but I want to make sure
 
01:47:59.189 --> 01:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
in in SE in section six so I'm looking
 
01:48:01.870 --> 01:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
page six line
 
01:48:05.550 --> 01:48:05.560 align:start position:0%
17 this is where the the uh the policy
 
01:48:08.669 --> 01:48:08.679 align:start position:0%
on on state Grant so now we're talking
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
about the um the the funding mechanism
 
01:48:13.950 --> 01:48:13.960 align:start position:0%
and we talked about how how when you
 
01:48:16.229 --> 01:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
take this Foundation opportunity budget
 
01:48:18.589 --> 01:48:18.599 align:start position:0%
and let's just let's just pick a number
 
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
for um for
 
01:48:24.109 --> 01:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
Hopkinson cuz I know Hopkin let's pick
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
the number for Hopkin that the
 
01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget came out
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
at $20 million we got 1,000 kids and
 
01:48:34.270 --> 01:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
it's not based on a Statewide average
 
01:48:36.390 --> 01:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
but all the differentiating factors all
 
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
that stuff came out to be $20
 
01:48:43.390 --> 01:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
million um the um the first the first
 
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
dollars to fund that $2 million budget
 
01:48:52.430 --> 01:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
come from section 6 and um and Roman 2
 
01:48:56.790 --> 01:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
down on starting on line 29 um and 30
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
where you can see five $5 per thousand
 
01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
of equalized assess valuation well that
 
01:49:05.950 --> 01:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
was based on a long time ago back when
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
Statewide we had a 220 um um you $220
 
01:49:12.109 --> 01:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
billion Statewide valuation we now have
 
01:49:15.870 --> 01:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
a $340 billion Statewide valuation so
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
the this this local minimum contribution
 
01:49:21.550 --> 01:49:21.560 align:start position:0%
that that attorney ardinger was talking
 
01:49:24.830 --> 01:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
about um that would I think we need to
 
01:49:28.350 --> 01:49:28.360 align:start position:0%
recalculate how that's done based on
 
01:49:33.189 --> 01:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
based on uh a an a Statewide share
 
01:49:37.310 --> 01:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal policy a Statewide share um of
 
01:49:39.669 --> 01:49:39.679 align:start position:0%
for for State funding of public um
 
01:49:41.950 --> 01:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
Public Schools so whether that's going
 
01:49:46.430 --> 01:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
to be 41 42 50% something like that you
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
calculate what that is and then based on
 
01:49:51.310 --> 01:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
a Statewide basis you calculate that
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
local minimum contribution
 
01:49:56.310 --> 01:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
um based on that Statewide share divided
 
01:49:59.350 --> 01:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
by the the total property tax base in
 
01:50:01.229 --> 01:50:01.239 align:start position:0%
the I'm sure I'm oversimplifying I don't
 
01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
know if uh if there's any folks from Dr
 
01:50:07.629 --> 01:50:07.639 align:start position:0%
here no they'll be here they so I'm I'm
 
01:50:09.310 --> 01:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
oversimplifying but I think for the
 
01:50:12.430 --> 01:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
example here you know if the Statewide
 
01:50:15.390 --> 01:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
share was let's say
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
42% of of our current um total K total
 
01:50:23.669 --> 01:50:23.679 align:start position:0%
current K12 expense attorney AR you said
 
01:50:23.679 --> 01:50:26.030 align:start position:0%
current K12 expense attorney AR you said
$3.4

01:50:26.030 --> 01:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
$3.4
 
01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
billion right I think he said that I
 
01:50:33.390 --> 01:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
mean I'm really close um uh 42% would be
 
01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:36.270 align:start position:0%
mean I'm really close um uh 42% would be
about

01:50:36.270 --> 01:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:40.830 --> 01:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
1.3 billion dollar currently we
 
01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:43.430 align:start position:0%
1.3 billion dollar currently we
spend

01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
spend
 
01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:46.390 align:start position:0%
spend
1.06

01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
1.06
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
billion I think I'm really close it's
 
01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
close and um and so at 42% goes from
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
1.06 to $1.3 billion so a $250 million
 
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
increase but that's only if we're at
 
01:51:05.910 --> 01:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
100% remember we said starting at 80%
 
01:51:08.669 --> 01:51:08.679 align:start position:0%
and phasing it in over five
 
01:51:11.629 --> 01:51:11.639 align:start position:0%
years so I think we can we can come up
 
01:51:14.069 --> 01:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
with a with a transition plan that
 
01:51:16.030 --> 01:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
starts very close to where we are right
 
01:51:18.109 --> 01:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
now and this is all stuff that we should
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
kick around but but that that um that
 
01:51:25.790 --> 01:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
minimum local contribution becomes the
 
01:51:29.589 --> 01:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
first dollars that go towards
 
01:51:32.270 --> 01:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
hopkinton's $20 million Foundation
 
01:51:34.709 --> 01:51:34.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget so if we just stuck
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
with the example here $5 per thousand
 
01:51:41.109 --> 01:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
hopkinson's got an A uh
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh I think we've got a total valuation
 
01:51:49.069 --> 01:51:49.079 align:start position:0%
of about a billion dollars so so um so
 
01:51:51.790 --> 01:51:51.800 align:start position:0%
so $5 per th000 would generate $5
 
01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:54.270 align:start position:0%
so $5 per th000 would generate $5
million

01:51:54.270 --> 01:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
right am I doing the math right here
 
01:51:59.149 --> 01:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
sounds good right billion dollar
 
01:52:02.109 --> 01:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
valuation dollar per th000 yeah so
 
01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
billion goes to a million times five
 
01:52:08.229 --> 01:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
gives you $5 million the state Grant the
 
01:52:09.870 --> 01:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
state Foundation opportunity budget
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
grant for Hopkinson I'm looking at my
 
01:52:14.709 --> 01:52:14.719 align:start position:0%
ways and means and finance people to
 
01:52:19.709 --> 01:52:19.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:24.270 --> 01:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
million and so hopkinson's
 
01:52:26.430 --> 01:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
Hopkinson would then I mean that that's
 
01:52:28.109 --> 01:52:28.119 align:start position:0%
all they need to
 
01:52:32.229 --> 01:52:32.239 align:start position:0%
spend is the $5 is that mandatory that
 
01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
local minimum contribution towards their
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
Foundation opportunity budget if they
 
01:52:38.109 --> 01:52:38.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to spend more than that they
 
01:52:40.270 --> 01:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
could and they can debate the heck out
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
of this on the floor of school district
 
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
meeting um it would make for a great
 
01:52:46.870 --> 01:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
debate too because the state says you
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
only need to spend this why do you want
 
01:52:51.310 --> 01:52:51.320 align:start position:0%
all this extra stuff and and there's
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
probably going to be towns I'm sure
 
01:52:54.189 --> 01:52:54.199 align:start position:0%
they're going to say hey we want some
 
01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
extra stuff too and and maybe they'll do
 
01:53:01.229 --> 01:53:01.239 align:start position:0%
that but but for a lot of communities
 
01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
many many communities certainly
 
01:53:06.189 --> 01:53:06.199 align:start position:0%
Claremont Pittsfield and Berlin um their
 
01:53:08.589 --> 01:53:08.599 align:start position:0%
budgets in Manchester not even close to
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
the foundation opportunity budget and
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
when when Mark runs the sheets and I
 
01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
said we'd eventually be getting into the
 
01:53:18.189 --> 01:53:18.199 align:start position:0%
town by towns fact I'm really glad we're
 
01:53:19.870 --> 01:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
having this conversation without having
 
01:53:21.870 --> 01:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
the town by towns first because we can
 
01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
really talk about this
 
01:53:27.870 --> 01:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
as in about how it
 
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
works um and then and then see it
 
01:53:33.270 --> 01:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
manifest when when Mark has the uh the
 
01:53:35.910 --> 01:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets done but um but that's
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
basically how the how the how the
 
01:53:40.910 --> 01:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
costing formula Works where we talked
 
01:53:43.629 --> 01:53:43.639 align:start position:0%
about on the prior page with the weights
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
and the Bas and how the funding um
 
01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
portion works with the local minimum
 
01:53:53.350 --> 01:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
contribution and the State comes in with
 
01:53:56.790 --> 01:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
the grants and that's on the uh the next
 
01:53:56.800 --> 01:53:58.390 align:start position:0%
the grants and that's on the uh the next
page

01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:54:01.229 --> 01:54:01.239 align:start position:0%
um determine oh sorry that's the term of
 
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:16.229 --> 01:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:21.069 --> 01:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
isation I promise you it's in here it's
 
01:54:36.229 --> 01:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
basically calculated as the difference
 
01:54:38.950 --> 01:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
between the local contribution and the
 
01:54:42.550 --> 01:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity bu
 
01:54:45.589 --> 01:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
um uh one of the other things that um
 
01:54:48.990 --> 01:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
that um attorney arer talked about was
 
01:54:50.910 --> 01:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
the determination of transition grants
 
01:54:53.830 --> 01:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
so that's on the next page at page seven
 
01:54:57.310 --> 01:54:57.320 align:start position:0%
so where um where uh where districts may
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
be seeing uh less from the state um
 
01:55:06.109 --> 01:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
swept that that that there are TR tax
 
01:55:11.550 --> 01:55:11.560 align:start position:0%
transition grants over a five-year
 
01:55:13.830 --> 01:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
period that phases that in so that they
 
01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
don't see any shock in year one um so
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
100% of the difference in year 1 80% in
 
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
year two and that tapers over a if you
 
01:55:25.550 --> 01:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
recall what what is the amount of excess
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
is it roughly around 27 million
 
01:55:29.830 --> 01:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
something like that yeah is that where
 
01:55:32.830 --> 01:55:32.840 align:start position:0%
we are said 29 million y
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
35 it's it's right yeah but you're
 
01:55:37.589 --> 01:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
you're right in the ballp part so on
 
01:55:40.270 --> 01:55:40.280 align:start position:0%
that yeah okay and
 
01:55:43.790 --> 01:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
um and so if we want to sort of proceed
 
01:55:47.790 --> 01:55:47.800 align:start position:0%
through through the bill a dayve yeah
 
01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
the uh determination of State Foundation
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity grants is at page
 
01:56:05.229 --> 01:56:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:10.510 --> 01:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and and it's basically it's the
 
01:56:17.069 --> 01:56:17.079 align:start position:0%
budget netted out by
 
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.669 --> 01:56:29.679 align:start position:0%
yeah so um thank thank you dick so lines
 
01:56:33.870 --> 01:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
14 and 16 on page
 
01:56:37.589 --> 01:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
five Grant shall be the adjusted annual
 
01:56:39.109 --> 01:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
Foundation opportun budget for each
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
municipality reduced by B each Municipal
 
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
minimum Foundation budget
 
01:56:48.430 --> 01:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
contribution as determined in in 41A
 
01:56:50.669 --> 01:56:50.679 align:start position:0%
which is what we were what we had
 
01:56:54.510 --> 01:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
skipped up to with the $5 per thousand
 
01:56:56.990 --> 01:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
example um but like I said that that
 
01:57:00.629 --> 01:57:00.639 align:start position:0%
needs to be that needs to be the
 
01:57:02.350 --> 01:57:02.360 align:start position:0%
language there needs to be changed or
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
should be changed so that the the rate
 
01:57:09.589 --> 01:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
would float given given a fiscal policy
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
share of whatever percentage should be
 
01:57:15.870 --> 01:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
the the state state policy I think um
 
01:57:17.669 --> 01:57:17.679 align:start position:0%
Bill aringer handed out a sheet
 
01:57:19.069 --> 01:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
yesterday that had what all what
 
01:57:21.149 --> 01:57:21.159 align:start position:0%
different states do Massachusetts New
 
01:57:24.910 --> 01:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and others and um and um uh
 
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
obviously our our property valuations
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
change year to year and then and so a
 
01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
local minimum contribution rate should
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
um should be reflective of of those
 
01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
changes as opposed to having something
 
01:57:42.030 --> 01:57:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:45.709 --> 01:57:45.719 align:start position:0%
statute yes represent dry thank you um
 
01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
before we move on to the next part at
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
the top of page five it talks about uh
 
01:57:52.910 --> 01:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
none of the funds
 
01:57:54.510 --> 01:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
uh are used for any other purpose
 
01:57:56.229 --> 01:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
including what not limited to making
 
01:57:58.189 --> 01:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
payments to chartered Public Schools so
 
01:57:59.390 --> 01:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
what happens to
 
01:58:03.149 --> 01:58:03.159 align:start position:0%
them I think later on in this bill we
 
01:58:05.830 --> 01:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
have a a section on it there's a study
 
01:58:10.030 --> 01:58:10.040 align:start position:0%
to uh a chapter to to study how how this
 
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
could extend to chartered public schools
 
01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
and I would also say that that it would
 
01:58:19.069 --> 01:58:19.079 align:start position:0%
need to extend to um to how EFA programs
 
01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
are are funded as well uh because this
 
01:58:27.510 --> 01:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:34.350 --> 01:58:34.360 align:start position:0%
um y so that's a pretty big missing
 
01:58:37.589 --> 01:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
piece that's why it was put into as a
 
01:58:40.069 --> 01:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
study okay it establishes a study
 
01:58:43.709 --> 01:58:43.719 align:start position:0%
committee to um to examine how best to
 
01:58:46.310 --> 01:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
do that given a foundation opportunity
 
01:58:50.510 --> 01:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
budget uh framework okay thank
 
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
you okay casc yes uh just going a little
 
01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
further past the transition Grant so we
 
01:59:00.510 --> 01:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
you know when when the commission were
 
01:59:02.910 --> 01:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
completed there was a time when with
 
01:59:07.589 --> 01:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
arpa and car's act but that is n in void
 
01:59:11.229 --> 01:59:11.239 align:start position:0%
now right um I don't know enough thanks
 
01:59:12.430 --> 01:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question I have that
 
01:59:15.629 --> 01:59:15.639 align:start position:0%
noted in here too okay that that so so
 
01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
what Dr cascad is talking about is on
 
01:59:20.629 --> 01:59:20.639 align:start position:0%
page seven lines 30 and 31 yes where the
 
01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
transition grants would would come from
 
01:59:27.910 --> 01:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
any remaining ARB cares act funds and uh
 
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
I I don't know to what extent any of
 
01:59:31.589 --> 01:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
those are banked or I think they have to
 
01:59:36.109 --> 01:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
be used by 2026 September 2024 I thought
 
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
they have be obligated okay yeah they
 
01:59:41.390 --> 01:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
have to be obligated by September 2024
 
01:59:44.990 --> 01:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
so um so that's that's that's something
 
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
that that you know we would need to we
 
01:59:50.189 --> 01:59:50.199 align:start position:0%
would need to look at and what the
 
01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
source of funds the source of funds
 
01:59:54.430 --> 01:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
could be the education trust fund
 
01:59:57.470 --> 01:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
M yeah you'd have to change that I mean
 
02:00:00.350 --> 02:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
we could when are the uh it I thought
 
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
there had be spent by the 20 FY 26 yeah
 
02:00:11.310 --> 02:00:11.320 align:start position:0%
SP but obligated by September 2024
 
02:00:14.669 --> 02:00:14.679 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and so so you know like with
 
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
everything there's you know you know
 
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
wherever you take air out of the balloon
 
02:00:21.390 --> 02:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's going to get smaller
 
02:00:24.430 --> 02:00:24.440 align:start position:0%
and uh and so you know if
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
um if for instance you wanted to to have
 
02:00:29.629 --> 02:00:29.639 align:start position:0%
more of a remainder in the education
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
trust fund to support tax transition
 
02:00:34.750 --> 02:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
grants you could slow down the
 
02:00:37.149 --> 02:00:37.159 align:start position:0%
transition of of the foundation
 
02:00:39.310 --> 02:00:39.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity plan rather than over 5
 
02:00:42.069 --> 02:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
years starting at 80% maybe it's over
 
02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
over you know 7 years starting at 70% or
 
02:00:47.189 --> 02:00:47.199 align:start position:0%
something like that but then those
 
02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
transition grants are going to have to
 
02:00:50.510 --> 02:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
go greater because you're starting with
 
02:00:56.109 --> 02:00:56.119 align:start position:0%
a lower number uh to begin with u so it
 
02:00:58.430 --> 02:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
it's you know those are those are some
 
02:01:00.030 --> 02:01:00.040 align:start position:0%
competing things that we would need to
 
02:01:02.589 --> 02:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
iron out yes
 
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
question how does this work with
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts so there's
 
02:01:09.589 --> 02:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
section on
 
02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:18.910 --> 02:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:22.270 --> 02:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
seven okay
 
02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
and so the um the I think the idea here
 
02:01:30.189 --> 02:01:30.199 align:start position:0%
is is very similar to um to how our how
 
02:01:33.030 --> 02:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
how municipalities currently receive
 
02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
funding for the school districts where
 
02:01:38.229 --> 02:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
they where they participate and so the
 
02:01:40.229 --> 02:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
the funding through the foundation
 
02:01:42.510 --> 02:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget is still done at the
 
02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:43.430 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget is still done at the
M

02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
M
 
02:01:46.109 --> 02:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
municipality level so remember you've
 
02:01:47.709 --> 02:01:47.719 align:start position:0%
got costing which is the foundation
 
02:01:49.390 --> 02:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget and then you've got
 
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
funding which which is basically by
 
02:01:55.709 --> 02:01:55.719 align:start position:0%
municipality and um and
 
02:01:58.430 --> 02:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
there different co-ops have I think
 
02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
different agreements in terms of share
 
02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
and so it would have to follow th that
 
02:02:08.629 --> 02:02:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:08.639 --> 02:02:12.870 align:start position:0%
 
share

02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
yeah yes yes so on a very fundamental
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
basis I just want to make sure I
 
02:02:22.669 --> 02:02:22.679 align:start position:0%
understand um at least structural how
 
02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
the revenues would be raised say that
 
02:02:26.830 --> 02:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
again I'm sorry I want to understand
 
02:02:28.950 --> 02:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
structurally how the revenues would be
 
02:02:31.229 --> 02:02:31.239 align:start position:0%
raised if if I'm following
 
02:02:34.189 --> 02:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
this every Community regardless of
 
02:02:36.069 --> 02:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
whether it's got a district of its own
 
02:02:38.430 --> 02:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
or it's in a Cooperative School District
 
02:02:40.950 --> 02:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for assessing $5
 
02:02:43.629 --> 02:02:43.639 align:start position:0%
per thousand value to real
 
02:02:46.069 --> 02:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
property and that would be the basic
 
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
contribution there'd be the calculated
 
02:02:51.990 --> 02:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh model budget the state would pick up
 
02:02:54.990 --> 02:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
the balance uh to that regardless of
 
02:02:58.030 --> 02:02:58.040 align:start position:0%
what the for example um articles of
 
02:03:00.550 --> 02:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
agreement for Cooperative District
 
02:03:04.390 --> 02:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
indicate and then uh locally but now in
 
02:03:07.310 --> 02:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
the case of a of a re of a school
 
02:03:10.189 --> 02:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
district the collective group of towns
 
02:03:11.950 --> 02:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
comprising that school district would
 
02:03:14.270 --> 02:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
have their Collective debate about
 
02:03:17.069 --> 02:03:17.079 align:start position:0%
whether they wanted to authoriz spending
 
02:03:20.149 --> 02:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
beyond that and then they would allocate
 
02:03:21.990 --> 02:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
that burden according to their article
 
02:03:25.950 --> 02:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
of agreement which would roll back into
 
02:03:29.430 --> 02:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
a further charge against local education
 
02:03:32.709 --> 02:03:32.719 align:start position:0%
tax is that more or less correct I I
 
02:03:34.589 --> 02:03:34.599 align:start position:0%
think you've without getting at all into
 
02:03:36.149 --> 02:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
the question of how the state raises its
 
02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
portion sure I think you've summed it up
 
02:03:40.030 --> 02:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
but the local Ed tax would be a
 
02:03:44.669 --> 02:03:44.679 align:start position:0%
combination of a $5 base plus whatever
 
02:03:48.109 --> 02:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
shakes out of a local
 
02:03:51.149 --> 02:03:51.159 align:start position:0%
districtwide um resolution on extra
 
02:03:52.549 --> 02:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
spending right
 
02:03:54.669 --> 02:03:54.679 align:start position:0%
okay that that's absolutely correct the
 
02:03:56.950 --> 02:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
only caveat I would say is the $5 base
 
02:03:59.549 --> 02:03:59.559 align:start position:0%
obviously was using three-year-old data
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's that would you know calculating
 
02:04:05.790 --> 02:04:05.800 align:start position:0%
that local minimum contribution rate
 
02:04:08.629 --> 02:04:08.639 align:start position:0%
would uh would would be recalculated
 
02:04:11.910 --> 02:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
based on on what uh what we come down
 
02:04:13.470 --> 02:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
for as a state
 
02:04:17.470 --> 02:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
share and total valuation across the
 
02:04:20.189 --> 02:04:20.199 align:start position:0%
state yeah I okay that's that's an
 
02:04:22.750 --> 02:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
interesting clarification obviously
 
02:04:24.470 --> 02:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
costs are a moving Target and how you
 
02:04:26.430 --> 02:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
raise it may therefore be a moving
 
02:04:28.669 --> 02:04:28.679 align:start position:0%
Target but in an Ideal
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
World we would have an understanding
 
02:04:35.310 --> 02:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
that a certain portion of a um property
 
02:04:39.870 --> 02:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
owner's value could be dedicated to any
 
02:04:43.750 --> 02:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
purpose in this case local education and
 
02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
that $5 is that reasonable amount and as
 
02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:47.990 align:start position:0%
that $5 is that reasonable amount and as
property

02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:04:52.510 --> 02:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
values shift or rise then that allows
 
02:04:54.990 --> 02:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
for more funds to be raised but one of
 
02:04:56.750 --> 02:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
the fundamental problems we have and and
 
02:04:58.990 --> 02:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
we want to get away from that in this
 
02:05:00.510 --> 02:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
well one of the things I think that is
 
02:05:03.030 --> 02:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
most fundamentally flawed in the New
 
02:05:07.790 --> 02:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Revenue model is that uh we
 
02:05:12.589 --> 02:05:12.599 align:start position:0%
just reverse engineer from our costs to
 
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
How Deeply we're going to burden real
 
02:05:17.069 --> 02:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
estate tax and the more we can get away
 
02:05:18.549 --> 02:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
from that in this Bild the better we
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
would be do you see what I'm saying it
 
02:05:25.229 --> 02:05:25.239 align:start position:0%
would be great have a $5 and just fix it
 
02:05:28.069 --> 02:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
forever yeah let real estate values
 
02:05:31.709 --> 02:05:31.719 align:start position:0%
fluctuate or rise but but but that's a
 
02:05:34.510 --> 02:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
percentage of a valuation and in an
 
02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
ideal world that would be locked into
 
02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
eternity um I I I hear what you're
 
02:05:43.350 --> 02:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
saying and and I I'm really here to
 
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
present not debate but we're in sort of
 
02:05:48.790 --> 02:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
like a work group type situation when
 
02:05:51.629 --> 02:05:51.639 align:start position:0%
when $5 was calculated and you know
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
working with with dick GES and Mel and
 
02:06:00.069 --> 02:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
and Bill uh on this uh it was uh 2020 or
 
02:06:02.430 --> 02:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
2021 and I think we had Statewide
 
02:06:06.750 --> 02:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
property values of $220 billion so um uh
 
02:06:08.549 --> 02:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
so you know
 
02:06:11.790 --> 02:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
five and and you know let me just pick
 
02:06:13.870 --> 02:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
on Hopkinson we had hopkinson's
 
02:06:16.189 --> 02:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
valuation was around
 
02:06:23.149 --> 02:06:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:26.830 --> 02:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
um $3.8 million something something like
 
02:06:31.149 --> 02:06:31.159 align:start position:0%
that um $5 today in Hopkinton raises $5
 
02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
million because property values have
 
02:06:37.310 --> 02:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
gone way up when um when you've got um
 
02:06:39.990 --> 02:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
select boards and school boards that are
 
02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
developing budgets uh they're not devel
 
02:06:45.390 --> 02:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
developing those budgets based on a
 
02:06:48.990 --> 02:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
fixed um property tax rate the property
 
02:06:52.270 --> 02:06:52.280 align:start position:0%
tax rate adjusts to that budget so if
 
02:06:54.990 --> 02:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
valuations go up that property tax rate
 
02:06:58.669 --> 02:06:58.679 align:start position:0%
comes down and and um and I guess what
 
02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
I'm what I'm what I'm sort of saying in
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
in this is that is that in the three
 
02:07:08.270 --> 02:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
years since we originally drafted this
 
02:07:11.830 --> 02:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh I I think you know when when when
 
02:07:15.910 --> 02:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
looking at how how we prescribe $5 per
 
02:07:19.549 --> 02:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
thousand that that that would put um a
 
02:07:24.830 --> 02:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
very heavy burden on on um on on on tax
 
02:07:27.229 --> 02:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers given a sub a
 
02:07:29.310 --> 02:07:29.320 align:start position:0%
significant rise up in property
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
valuation and that maybe that that tax
 
02:07:36.270 --> 02:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
rate should come down um uh in order to
 
02:07:39.990 --> 02:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
raise the same amount of local
 
02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
contribution dollars towards that
 
02:07:45.470 --> 02:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
Foundation opportunity budget and and um
 
02:07:47.629 --> 02:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
followup question the drra has suggested
 
02:07:50.030 --> 02:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
way do that so are we going to be able
 
02:07:52.910 --> 02:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
to remodel that and and see how it
 
02:07:55.069 --> 02:07:55.079 align:start position:0%
shakes out absolutely in these coming
 
02:07:57.510 --> 02:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
weeks before February 15th thank you
 
02:08:00.069 --> 02:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
that's why you're on this committee y
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
yeah and we'll and and and Terry we'll
 
02:08:05.790 --> 02:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
remodel that um using using you know
 
02:08:09.950 --> 02:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
current the latest Dr valuation numbers
 
02:08:13.669 --> 02:08:13.679 align:start position:0%
so yes GES I just wanted to note because
 
02:08:15.830 --> 02:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been said that
 
02:08:18.910 --> 02:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
um the minimum Foundation budget
 
02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:22.030 align:start position:0%
um the minimum Foundation budget
contribution

02:08:22.030 --> 02:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:25.069 --> 02:08:25.079 align:start position:0%
is $5 per thousand
 
02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
or it is the municipality's adjusted
 
02:08:31.709 --> 02:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
annual Foundation opportunity budget I
 
02:08:34.229 --> 02:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
was trying to say this for my friend
 
02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
over there who's engaged in a lively
 
02:08:39.750 --> 02:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:42.310 --> 02:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
seatmate let me try
 
02:08:47.790 --> 02:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
again the uh I wanted everybody to note
 
02:08:51.189 --> 02:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
that um when we say $5 per thousand or
 
02:08:53.910 --> 02:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
I'll say x per thousand because that's
 
02:08:57.189 --> 02:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
going to change um as the amount that's
 
02:08:59.790 --> 02:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
going to be raised locally it's going to
 
02:09:03.390 --> 02:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
be less than that for
 
02:09:06.629 --> 02:09:06.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities we could name them um
 
02:09:09.149 --> 02:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
that are currently raising more and
 
02:09:11.350 --> 02:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
would be raising under this new
 
02:09:14.350 --> 02:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
Arrangement more than the foundation
 
02:09:16.709 --> 02:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget they only have to
 
02:09:20.109 --> 02:09:20.119 align:start position:0%
raise up to that budget so it might be
 
02:09:23.950 --> 02:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
4% to to use the five as the starting
 
02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
point and so forth that's an important
 
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
difference thank you thank you
 
02:09:32.310 --> 02:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
represent okay we're getting pretty
 
02:09:33.950 --> 02:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
close to the time we should take a break
 
02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
because we're gonna have people walking
 
02:09:37.709 --> 02:09:37.719 align:start position:0%
in here at one o'clock oh wait the
 
02:09:40.149 --> 02:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
second part we're at 12:15 right
 
02:09:43.390 --> 02:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
now um so we some more right there on
 
02:09:44.870 --> 02:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
that you know we we've really gone
 
02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
through the um the the obviously there's
 
02:09:49.870 --> 02:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
a whole section on accountability yeah
 
02:09:52.629 --> 02:09:52.639 align:start position:0%
um you know I think we've described it
 
02:09:55.189 --> 02:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
as a as a as a tight feedback loop to
 
02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
the definition of an adequate education
 
02:09:59.589 --> 02:09:59.599 align:start position:0%
and the funding of that adequate
 
02:10:02.350 --> 02:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
education so um
 
02:10:06.669 --> 02:10:06.679 align:start position:0%
so certainly take a look at at that um I
 
02:10:09.870 --> 02:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
I noted um representative Le's um
 
02:10:12.390 --> 02:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
suggestions yesterday about having it
 
02:10:14.669 --> 02:10:14.679 align:start position:0%
apply not just to schools that were
 
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
underperforming but to all schools and I
 
02:10:19.589 --> 02:10:19.599 align:start position:0%
think that's a very reasonable approach
 
02:10:21.709 --> 02:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
for the Department to make sure that all
 
02:10:25.870 --> 02:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
schools are um are meeting that um that
 
02:10:29.549 --> 02:10:29.559 align:start position:0%
uh uh that student outcome Benchmark um
 
02:10:32.189 --> 02:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
and then the the last part of the bill
 
02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
is um is the uh swept reform we talked
 
02:10:40.229 --> 02:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:44.830 --> 02:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
1686 uh 1686 1686 it's very similar to
 
02:10:47.669 --> 02:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
the swep or form in 1686 with the
 
02:10:50.750 --> 02:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
exception that while all of the
 
02:10:53.229 --> 02:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax is collected
 
02:10:57.390 --> 02:10:57.400 align:start position:0%
locally 100% of it is remitted to the to
 
02:11:01.950 --> 02:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
the uh to the State Treasury and um and
 
02:11:05.189 --> 02:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
the foundation opportunity grants that
 
02:11:08.149 --> 02:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
that U municipalities are entitled to
 
02:11:10.109 --> 02:11:10.119 align:start position:0%
will come directly back to that
 
02:11:12.750 --> 02:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
municipality from the um from the state
 
02:11:15.390 --> 02:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
treasury so there's no like retained
 
02:11:17.790 --> 02:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
swept or or anything like that that
 
02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
eliminates the negative tax rate dilemma
 
02:11:24.830 --> 02:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
with respect to um uh retained uh excess
 
02:11:27.910 --> 02:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
swept um the other thing beyond that and
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
this is getting right to the tail end
 
02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
the bill so won't um you know we
 
02:11:35.470 --> 02:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
can we've talked about it with other
 
02:11:39.109 --> 02:11:39.119 align:start position:0%
bills um is uh is an expanded low and
 
02:11:40.910 --> 02:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
moderate property ta low and moderate
 
02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
income property tax relief fund so that
 
02:11:46.109 --> 02:11:46.119 align:start position:0%
increase currently the the draw on that
 
02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
is I think we heard yesterday $1.6
 
02:11:50.830 --> 02:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
million a year um we would intend to
 
02:11:55.030 --> 02:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
fund that at a at a level of $25 million
 
02:11:58.549 --> 02:11:58.559 align:start position:0%
per year and provide property tax relief
 
02:12:01.390 --> 02:12:01.400 align:start position:0%
not to all property taxes that live in a
 
02:12:04.069 --> 02:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
certain zip code whether they need it or
 
02:12:09.870 --> 02:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
not um but but property tax relief to
 
02:12:12.350 --> 02:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
any property taxpayer living in any
 
02:12:15.390 --> 02:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
municipality anywhere in the state that
 
02:12:19.229 --> 02:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
that um qualifies under certain criteria
 
02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
income criteria and and I think there's
 
02:12:24.830 --> 02:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
some other criteria in there and that's
 
02:12:26.950 --> 02:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
that's for for our friends from Ways and
 
02:12:29.350 --> 02:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
Means I think they saw that in House
 
02:12:33.189 --> 02:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
Bill 56 569 569 um from representative
 
02:12:36.270 --> 02:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
Ames uh has those two pieces um
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
identical there may be some little tweak
 
02:12:40.830 --> 02:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
differences that that we could align
 
02:12:44.709 --> 02:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
with that but um but um anyway that's
 
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
all I got thank you any further
 
02:12:50.109 --> 02:12:50.119 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee right now
 
02:12:52.310 --> 02:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
to I think we're ready for
 
02:12:54.669 --> 02:12:54.679 align:start position:0%
lunch so I think we're going to break
 
02:12:57.229 --> 02:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
right now and we'll come back at
 
02:13:01.470 --> 02:13:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
here no we were just going to get
 
02:13:06.390 --> 02:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
through the Dr and the doe doing the
 
02:13:08.589 --> 02:13:08.599 align:start position:0%
thing and then we'll some wrap up
 
02:13:10.030 --> 02:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
discussion ourselves then we're out of
 
02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:10.990 align:start position:0%
discussion ourselves then we're out of
here

02:13:10.990 --> 02:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:13:16.270 --> 02:13:16.280 align:start position:0%
so 1 2:30 maybe 2:30 3 3
 
02:13:20.109 --> 02:13:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:06.109 --> 02:14:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
my wife said you know I've been used to
 
02:14:10.709 --> 02:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
having for supper whenever I get home
 
02:14:20.030 --> 02:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:50.030 align:start position:0%
 
always

02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:50.040 align:start position:0%

03:08:34.790 --> 03:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
discuss pH okay yeah we had a discussion
 
03:08:37.229 --> 03:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
early this morning on on 1586 a brief
 
03:08:40.229 --> 03:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
discussion and um there were some
 
03:08:43.110 --> 03:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
questions that came out of that and also
 
03:08:46.150 --> 03:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh we have not got into a discussion yet
 
03:08:48.190 --> 03:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
on the other other bills which are
 
03:08:52.190 --> 03:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
dealing with the uh base cost um uh
 
03:08:55.429 --> 03:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
increase that's basically uh a change
 
03:08:58.630 --> 03:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
just in in a costing amount and in the
 
03:09:01.670 --> 03:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
um special ed uh differentiated a that's
 
03:09:03.550 --> 03:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
also a change in the costing
 
03:09:08.190 --> 03:09:08.200 align:start position:0%
amount uh swep we we um have discussed
 
03:09:09.830 --> 03:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
it in conjunction with
 
03:09:14.110 --> 03:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
1586 so right now um did we flip the
 
03:09:15.590 --> 03:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
coin and see who's going to start
 
03:09:17.070 --> 03:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
together are you going to still do it
 
03:09:17.080 --> 03:09:18.110 align:start position:0%
together are you going to still do it
collap

03:09:18.110 --> 03:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
collap
 
03:09:20.670 --> 03:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
together interact with each other Dr and
 
03:09:23.389 --> 03:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
doe yep I thought you're going to sit
 
03:09:24.750 --> 03:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
together but
 
03:09:27.110 --> 03:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
no there must be something between these
 
03:09:31.910 --> 03:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
two departments um so
 
03:09:36.110 --> 03:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh in regard to 1586 Mark
 
03:09:40.710 --> 03:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
M do you have some um uh insights for us
 
03:09:43.670 --> 03:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
in regard to 1586 or some areas where
 
03:09:44.750 --> 03:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
maybe there have to be some
 
03:09:47.630 --> 03:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
modifications or changes Etc yeah
 
03:09:49.910 --> 03:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
there's um so obviously as uh some of
 
03:09:51.590 --> 03:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
you might remember from two years ago it
 
03:09:53.830 --> 03:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
was 1680 um so the dates have been
 
03:09:58.190 --> 03:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
updated so um I think I uh verbally told
 
03:09:59.229 --> 03:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
the committee some of the technical
 
03:10:00.670 --> 03:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
errors but I think I need to kind of get
 
03:10:02.630 --> 03:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
those more in writing um so that they
 
03:10:04.510 --> 03:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
can be codified um so some of the
 
03:10:06.150 --> 03:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
technical errors still exist some of
 
03:10:08.269 --> 03:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
them are um kind of the ones we're used
 
03:10:13.990 --> 03:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
to seeing an admr adma um uh map um some
 
03:10:16.870 --> 03:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
of the ones you've already discussed uh
 
03:10:20.910 --> 03:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
relative to how IT addresses um efas and
 
03:10:23.950 --> 03:10:23.960 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools um this is just again
 
03:10:25.750 --> 03:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
I'll put this in writing at some point
 
03:10:27.670 --> 03:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
but it it kind of um a technical error
 
03:10:30.229 --> 03:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
with it um it sort of puts them in limbo
 
03:10:31.790 --> 03:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
and then defunds them why they're in
 
03:10:34.990 --> 03:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
limbo um so if you're um you want to
 
03:10:36.229 --> 03:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
have a position if the subcommittee
 
03:10:37.550 --> 03:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
wants to have a position on the EFA
 
03:10:39.269 --> 03:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
program and charter school program
 
03:10:41.870 --> 03:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
meaning if you want to put them sort of
 
03:10:44.190 --> 03:10:44.200 align:start position:0%
in limbo and then defund them then
 
03:10:45.990 --> 03:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's what the bill does as introduced
 
03:10:47.389 --> 03:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
I don't think that was the intent I
 
03:10:49.190 --> 03:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
think the not the intent the intent was
 
03:10:51.190 --> 03:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
to study them um so that is currently
 
03:10:52.950 --> 03:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
just a technical issue with the bill as
 
03:10:55.469 --> 03:10:55.479 align:start position:0%
introduced um you were discussing the
 
03:10:57.870 --> 03:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
ARP money uh my understanding is that
 
03:10:59.710 --> 03:10:59.720 align:start position:0%
money is likely unavailable and likely
 
03:11:01.269 --> 03:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
already is out the door and needs to be
 
03:11:03.190 --> 03:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
out the door very quickly um so that's
 
03:11:05.190 --> 03:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
again just a technical issue where that
 
03:11:06.790 --> 03:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
bill is looking to seek to use those
 
03:11:08.510 --> 03:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
funds and those funds essentially don't
 
03:11:11.309 --> 03:11:11.319 align:start position:0%
exist um so so you're going quickly here
 
03:11:14.790 --> 03:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
yep uh so the transition
 
03:11:17.870 --> 03:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
to uh put the 158
 
03:11:20.910 --> 03:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
uh into full speed we need some of that
 
03:11:23.910 --> 03:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
money to do that correct to the the
 
03:11:26.510 --> 03:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
intent as introduced was to use federal
 
03:11:30.349 --> 03:11:30.359 align:start position:0%
funds to pay for that transition
 
03:11:32.870 --> 03:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
correct but um and as you discussed as I
 
03:11:35.670 --> 03:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
was watching guys on YouTube um you
 
03:11:37.349 --> 03:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
could draw that from the Surplus the
 
03:11:39.550 --> 03:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
Surplus is I mean this is a now a ways
 
03:11:41.990 --> 03:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
and means and finance decision obviously
 
03:11:44.590 --> 03:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
um but the alternative would be to fund
 
03:11:45.990 --> 03:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
basically you're funding it from the
 
03:11:49.349 --> 03:11:49.359 align:start position:0%
education trust fund would by default
 
03:11:51.950 --> 03:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
and yeah you were discussing that um but
 
03:11:54.830 --> 03:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
that's so the the Essa not the Essa
 
03:11:57.710 --> 03:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
sorry the arp arp issue um EFA Charter
 
03:12:00.710 --> 03:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
School issue um that's some housekeeping
 
03:12:03.269 --> 03:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
um the admr that's very easy
 
03:12:05.510 --> 03:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
housekeeping uh the other thing
 
03:12:07.070 --> 03:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative luno and I were chatting
 
03:12:08.309 --> 03:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
and representative luno told the
 
03:12:10.670 --> 03:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
committee the bill is introduced
 
03:12:13.070 --> 03:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
basically doesn't do what it's supposed
 
03:12:14.830 --> 03:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
to do and it's because of our growth and
 
03:12:17.670 --> 03:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
property values so repres pres luno and
 
03:12:20.070 --> 03:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
I ran um I have some numbers I'm not
 
03:12:22.030 --> 03:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
really confident to send them out like
 
03:12:23.349 --> 03:12:23.359 align:start position:0%
in a spreadsheet and I don't want to go
 
03:12:25.229 --> 03:12:25.239 align:start position:0%
town by town until we're ready to
 
03:12:26.710 --> 03:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
actually kind of really get into the
 
03:12:29.790 --> 03:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
weeds um but the bill as currently
 
03:12:32.750 --> 03:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
written and is introduced would decrease
 
03:12:34.269 --> 03:12:34.279 align:start position:0%
school funding by hundreds of millions
 
03:12:36.670 --> 03:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
of dollars and the reason that is is
 
03:12:38.910 --> 03:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
because of our property growth so you
 
03:12:40.590 --> 03:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
have the foundation opportunity budget
 
03:12:42.670 --> 03:12:42.680 align:start position:0%
that's up here it's it's hitting a
 
03:12:45.150 --> 03:12:45.160 align:start position:0%
benchmark uh a standard to provide a
 
03:12:47.349 --> 03:12:47.359 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget and then
 
03:12:50.830 --> 03:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
you immediately apply that $5 tax rate
 
03:12:52.910 --> 03:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
and since that $5 tax rate against our
 
03:12:55.469 --> 03:12:55.479 align:start position:0%
really robust property growth brings in
 
03:12:57.990 --> 03:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
so much money less State money goes out
 
03:13:01.150 --> 03:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
the door as introduced so representative
 
03:13:03.670 --> 03:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
luno and I overheard I was watching uh
 
03:13:07.469 --> 03:13:07.479 align:start position:0%
the committee um the percent of State
 
03:13:08.990 --> 03:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
share is a way we could do that I have
 
03:13:11.229 --> 03:13:11.239 align:start position:0%
to that that would be an easy fix or an
 
03:13:12.710 --> 03:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
easy way I just have to think about it a
 
03:13:12.720 --> 03:13:13.750 align:start position:0%
easy way I just have to think about it a
little

03:13:13.750 --> 03:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
little
 
03:13:20.870 --> 03:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:22.150 --> 03:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
but just trying to take the original
 
03:13:25.190 --> 03:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
intent and bring that property tax rate
 
03:13:26.790 --> 03:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
to a number that achieves the same
 
03:13:29.190 --> 03:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
results with the new property growth if
 
03:13:32.750 --> 03:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
I dropped it down to $3 per
 
03:13:36.590 --> 03:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
5,000 um and did nothing else it would
 
03:13:39.910 --> 03:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
reduce in a total net funding of less
 
03:13:43.190 --> 03:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
than $18 million so basically a less 18
 
03:13:45.269 --> 03:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
$18 million in state money money would
 
03:13:47.590 --> 03:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
go uh less 18 million uh less would go
 
03:13:49.190 --> 03:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
out the door compared
 
03:13:49.200 --> 03:13:50.910 align:start position:0%
out the door compared
to

03:13:50.910 --> 03:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:13:55.229 --> 03:13:55.239 align:start position:0%
yeah um so the other thing represent of
 
03:13:57.110 --> 03:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
luno and I discussed and
 
03:13:59.990 --> 03:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
and uh you know if the objective is to
 
03:14:02.750 --> 03:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
keep it relatively net neutral then
 
03:14:05.110 --> 03:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
that's not exactly net neutral you know
 
03:14:08.269 --> 03:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
$18 million out of a $3.5 billion
 
03:14:12.590 --> 03:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
economy is uh you'd say rounding ER but
 
03:14:16.429 --> 03:14:16.439 align:start position:0%
um if you want to increase it more you
 
03:14:18.429 --> 03:14:18.439 align:start position:0%
could change modifications like you
 
03:14:19.950 --> 03:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
could take that Universal base Aid
 
03:14:22.870 --> 03:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
amount and make it the conval
 
03:14:24.990 --> 03:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
number and running that really quickly
 
03:14:28.030 --> 03:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
that would result in $200 million more
 
03:14:30.630 --> 03:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
in state funding for schools so there's
 
03:14:34.670 --> 03:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of variables to Tinker with um I
 
03:14:35.870 --> 03:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
just sort of need I probably need to
 
03:14:37.469 --> 03:14:37.479 align:start position:0%
work with representative luno if it's
 
03:14:38.710 --> 03:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
what the committee is looking to do is
 
03:14:42.229 --> 03:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
to get that bill in a position to be
 
03:14:43.550 --> 03:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
ready to see spreadsheets I probably
 
03:14:45.790 --> 03:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
need to work with representative luno to
 
03:14:47.590 --> 03:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
get those V uh all the variables where
 
03:14:50.070 --> 03:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
they need to be and hit what the
 
03:14:52.389 --> 03:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
committee is interested in looking at um
 
03:14:53.269 --> 03:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
and then I can produce those
 
03:14:56.790 --> 03:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets Mr
 
03:14:59.670 --> 03:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
yes you talk fast and I'm trying to keep
 
03:15:02.389 --> 03:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
notes um can you go over once again
 
03:15:05.309 --> 03:15:05.319 align:start position:0%
about the efas and Charter Schools the
 
03:15:07.150 --> 03:15:07.160 align:start position:0%
the atttention of the bill and then the
 
03:15:09.550 --> 03:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
solution for it was the the bill has
 
03:15:12.710 --> 03:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
introduced repeals the section of law we
 
03:15:15.269 --> 03:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
use to fund efas meaning to to determine
 
03:15:18.790 --> 03:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
the grant amount and it repeals half of
 
03:15:20.630 --> 03:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
the section of law which is
 
03:15:23.269 --> 03:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
adequacy sorry it repeals adequacy as we
 
03:15:26.630 --> 03:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
know it and replaces it inadequacy
 
03:15:28.910 --> 03:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
currently that calculation of the grant
 
03:15:31.590 --> 03:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
is what funds efas in its entirety um
 
03:15:33.110 --> 03:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
and it does also what funds basically
 
03:15:35.349 --> 03:15:35.359 align:start position:0%
half of what Charter Schools receive um
 
03:15:36.830 --> 03:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
so that's a technical fix that would
 
03:15:39.110 --> 03:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
need to be made which would if you want
 
03:15:41.870 --> 03:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
to keep current law as is you could
 
03:15:44.870 --> 03:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
say you could say uh um you basically
 
03:15:48.030 --> 03:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
have to re get rid of out see where it
 
03:15:49.510 --> 03:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
exists but then also probably find a new
 
03:15:51.349 --> 03:15:51.359 align:start position:0%
home for it I mean that's just what the
 
03:15:52.630 --> 03:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
bill would that's what the amendment
 
03:15:54.510 --> 03:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
would have to look like okay um to the
 
03:15:57.269 --> 03:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
bill to keep efas and Charters funded at
 
03:16:00.710 --> 03:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
their current levels um so so just a
 
03:16:02.429 --> 03:16:02.439 align:start position:0%
just I thought on I think that's a very
 
03:16:05.550 --> 03:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
important um uh Point representative dry
 
03:16:08.790 --> 03:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh and uhu and not something that we
 
03:16:11.550 --> 03:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to to see drop but when we when
 
03:16:14.830 --> 03:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
we uh reenacted in the bill uh what is
 
03:16:18.429 --> 03:16:18.439 align:start position:0%
it 1984a mhm is that 198 that that's
 
03:16:20.990 --> 03:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
adequacy yeah yeah yeah and U and
 
03:16:25.110 --> 03:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
currently both the the charter um
 
03:16:27.790 --> 03:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
statute and the efh statute both refer
 
03:16:30.150 --> 03:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
to 194
 
03:16:32.469 --> 03:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
1984a uh we could put we could put
 
03:16:35.710 --> 03:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
something into Charter or or EFA yeah
 
03:16:37.469 --> 03:16:37.479 align:start position:0%
and then the other one whichever the
 
03:16:40.349 --> 03:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
other one is refer to that that would be
 
03:16:42.229 --> 03:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
that would be one way to to to a
 
03:16:44.309 --> 03:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
technical fix yeah yeah and it would it
 
03:16:46.469 --> 03:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
would basically look like our current
 
03:16:51.110 --> 03:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
one 98 um 4A okay and what was the study
 
03:16:52.309 --> 03:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
committee that you were talking about
 
03:16:54.189 --> 03:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
for that and there's a study committee
 
03:16:57.630 --> 03:16:57.640 align:start position:0%
in there to consider in the long ter in
 
03:17:00.830 --> 03:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
the long term how to how to fund uh
 
03:17:03.349 --> 03:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
Charters and efas and it's in the I
 
03:17:06.269 --> 03:17:06.279 align:start position:0%
think it's at the back of the um the uh
 
03:17:09.229 --> 03:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
1586 okay so just to be clear then then
 
03:17:11.750 --> 03:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
if they do the technical fix then efas
 
03:17:13.750 --> 03:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
and Charter Schools still stay funded
 
03:17:15.910 --> 03:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
while they're studied okay absolutely
 
03:17:17.469 --> 03:17:17.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely stay funded
 
03:17:19.590 --> 03:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
and and stay funded the same way they've
 
03:17:23.150 --> 03:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
been they are funded okay thank you
 
03:17:26.429 --> 03:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
yeah if you're working with uh represent
 
03:17:28.990 --> 03:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
luno to try and get a spreadsheet is
 
03:17:30.790 --> 03:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
there kind a time frame in which that
 
03:17:32.550 --> 03:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
might be available to this subcommittee
 
03:17:37.150 --> 03:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
so so doing one fiscal year um not that
 
03:17:39.389 --> 03:17:39.399 align:start position:0%
hard I mean it just as matter as what's
 
03:17:41.710 --> 03:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
the target what's the you know it's $200
 
03:17:43.670 --> 03:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
million that is that the target we're
 
03:17:45.510 --> 03:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
going for negative $18 million is that
 
03:17:48.870 --> 03:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
the target we're going for so so um and
 
03:17:48.880 --> 03:17:50.349 align:start position:0%
the target we're going for so so um and
so

03:17:50.349 --> 03:17:50.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:17:52.309 --> 03:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
there's there's a couple things I want
 
03:17:53.870 --> 03:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
to talk with you about that and and I
 
03:17:55.990 --> 03:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
think your your suggestion of using the
 
03:17:58.950 --> 03:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
conell number makes a lot of sense but
 
03:18:00.469 --> 03:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
but I'm also thinking we talked about
 
03:18:03.870 --> 03:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
this earlier having a 5year phase in
 
03:18:06.030 --> 03:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and so that's the that's the the
 
03:18:07.269 --> 03:18:07.279 align:start position:0%
tougher challenge with that I think
 
03:18:08.830 --> 03:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
doing a fiscal year analysis for one
 
03:18:10.189 --> 03:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet I've done that before and I
 
03:18:12.269 --> 03:18:12.279 align:start position:0%
can do that again um and we're just
 
03:18:14.229 --> 03:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
working some couple variables and I
 
03:18:15.389 --> 03:18:15.399 align:start position:0%
think representative Luna and have
 
03:18:17.189 --> 03:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
chatted about some of the variables that
 
03:18:19.910 --> 03:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
he thinks needs to move um doing a 5year
 
03:18:22.429 --> 03:18:22.439 align:start position:0%
analysis a little bit trickier but um I
 
03:18:23.990 --> 03:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
would want to have one an one year
 
03:18:25.469 --> 03:18:25.479 align:start position:0%
analysis that the committee is kind of
 
03:18:27.550 --> 03:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
interested in before I start doing you
 
03:18:32.070 --> 03:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:34.309 --> 03:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets thank thank you Mark thanks
 
03:18:36.830 --> 03:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
for are there any other technical
 
03:18:38.309 --> 03:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
aspects that you see that need
 
03:18:39.670 --> 03:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
correcting within the
 
03:18:42.389 --> 03:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
bill uh
 
03:18:45.910 --> 03:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
the I believe that's I believe that's it
 
03:18:47.670 --> 03:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh one one thing and that we debated
 
03:18:50.469 --> 03:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
this um or discussed this uh two years
 
03:18:52.349 --> 03:18:52.359 align:start position:0%
ago uh The
 
03:18:54.349 --> 03:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
Cooperative uh sorry no the school
 
03:18:57.910 --> 03:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
district size portion I'm that might
 
03:18:59.670 --> 03:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
need a little bit more study I don't
 
03:19:01.309 --> 03:19:01.319 align:start position:0%
know if I'm doing
 
03:19:04.950 --> 03:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
it it it's it's it probably works I just
 
03:19:06.469 --> 03:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
don't know if it works as the 2020
 
03:19:11.269 --> 03:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
commission intended um it I actually I I
 
03:19:13.070 --> 03:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know if it's worth going
 
03:19:14.910 --> 03:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
down that rabbit hole but I but I have a
 
03:19:17.229 --> 03:19:17.239 align:start position:0%
system in place to try to
 
03:19:19.070 --> 03:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
this is to so works in the bill this is
 
03:19:21.750 --> 03:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the cliff effect yeah as as
 
03:19:24.349 --> 03:19:24.359 align:start position:0%
you're going so um so we talked about
 
03:19:27.229 --> 03:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
this couple years ago too and it's I I
 
03:19:29.070 --> 03:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
don't think from a from a modeling
 
03:19:31.710 --> 03:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
standpoint it's it
 
03:19:35.189 --> 03:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
um it's a fairly minor it yeah so the
 
03:19:37.469 --> 03:19:37.479 align:start position:0%
only thing I'm doing that potentially
 
03:19:39.550 --> 03:19:39.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't this is now again really
 
03:19:41.309 --> 03:19:41.319 align:start position:0%
technical in the weeds here um we
 
03:19:42.910 --> 03:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
discussed this two years
 
03:19:46.790 --> 03:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
ago when you take an admr and an adma
 
03:19:49.189 --> 03:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
essentially a student is a student but
 
03:19:50.990 --> 03:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
you have to pick a measurement in order
 
03:19:53.229 --> 03:19:53.239 align:start position:0%
to put it into a data set and run it
 
03:19:56.110 --> 03:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
through an algorithm so I am using admr
 
03:19:59.030 --> 03:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
as the data point yes and so that might
 
03:20:01.349 --> 03:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
not have been the intent of the 2020
 
03:20:01.359 --> 03:20:02.950 align:start position:0%
not have been the intent of the 2020
commission

03:20:02.950 --> 03:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:20:05.670 --> 03:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
but converting an adma to an admr or
 
03:20:07.710 --> 03:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
saying they're equivalent at the end of
 
03:20:09.830 --> 03:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
the day isn't I don't think a big deal
 
03:20:11.670 --> 03:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
um but you do have to Define what
 
03:20:13.070 --> 03:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
measurement for student you want to use
 
03:20:15.990 --> 03:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
and so that's a that's a potential
 
03:20:18.110 --> 03:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
rabbit hole we could go down I I I I
 
03:20:20.630 --> 03:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
don't um it's all it's up to the sponsor
 
03:20:21.910 --> 03:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
as far as or the committee if they want
 
03:20:26.750 --> 03:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:30.870 --> 03:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
approach I mean Mr chairman well admr is
 
03:20:32.150 --> 03:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
what we want to use that's what I'm
 
03:20:35.309 --> 03:20:35.319 align:start position:0%
saying yeah yeah just as a non-education
 
03:20:38.030 --> 03:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
Committee Member is that average daily
 
03:20:40.910 --> 03:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
membership attendance versus residence
 
03:20:43.750 --> 03:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
or what is it okay thank you that that's
 
03:20:46.070 --> 03:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
corrected and and residence is how we
 
03:20:48.189 --> 03:20:48.199 align:start position:0%
fund because we fund it based on which
 
03:20:49.590 --> 03:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
school district is responsible for
 
03:20:51.590 --> 03:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
paying for the education attendance is
 
03:20:53.349 --> 03:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
where they attend school um sometime
 
03:20:54.590 --> 03:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
they're the same student or same
 
03:20:56.469 --> 03:20:56.479 align:start position:0%
measurement um a lot of times they're
 
03:20:59.590 --> 03:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
not or a good amount of
 
03:21:02.590 --> 03:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
times so when you're trying to Define
 
03:21:06.550 --> 03:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
this from a policy perspective uh this
 
03:21:09.469 --> 03:21:09.479 align:start position:0%
particular this weighted
 
03:21:15.229 --> 03:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:17.830 --> 03:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
school either
 
03:21:20.389 --> 03:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
represent luno can you please refresh my
 
03:21:24.070 --> 03:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
mind you know I I know it I can
 
03:21:28.189 --> 03:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
understand that the um the cost that it
 
03:21:31.150 --> 03:21:31.160 align:start position:0%
cost for example very small
 
03:21:33.110 --> 03:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
school because they don't have the
 
03:21:35.030 --> 03:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
population in the school of
 
03:21:37.469 --> 03:21:37.479 align:start position:0%
students but they have to re by our
 
03:21:41.070 --> 03:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
requirements provide certain programs so
 
03:21:43.469 --> 03:21:43.479 align:start position:0%
that efficiency of scale costing to the
 
03:21:45.750 --> 03:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
scale of what they've got there it seem
 
03:21:47.630 --> 03:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
it's more for the it's just like it
 
03:21:49.630 --> 03:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
costs more to run uh White Mountain
 
03:21:51.469 --> 03:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
Community College that does a larger
 
03:21:53.189 --> 03:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
Community College down here simply
 
03:21:55.510 --> 03:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
because of scale of numbers but they
 
03:21:57.870 --> 03:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
require providing all these courses that
 
03:22:02.910 --> 03:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
are required for a gen Ed um so uh we
 
03:22:05.429 --> 03:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
have that and there's also the that
 
03:22:06.990 --> 03:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
relationship with whether it's an
 
03:22:09.389 --> 03:22:09.399 align:start position:0%
elementary school a middle school or a
 
03:22:12.150 --> 03:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
high school where a high school has to
 
03:22:14.790 --> 03:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
have certain facilities and
 
03:22:18.469 --> 03:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
programs which require
 
03:22:21.710 --> 03:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
specialization chemistry for example uh
 
03:22:24.630 --> 03:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
verse uh teaching one how to read in a
 
03:22:27.269 --> 03:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
classroom in a Grade School so how are
 
03:22:28.990 --> 03:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
we accounting for all that within this
 
03:22:34.550 --> 03:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
model so so that's on page four line 16
 
03:22:39.309 --> 03:22:39.319 align:start position:0%
through 23 I'm sorry 24 page four page
 
03:22:44.269 --> 03:22:44.279 align:start position:0%
four line 16- 24 where the size of the
 
03:22:48.790 --> 03:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
school varying between one and 2,000 or
 
03:22:51.990 --> 03:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
over 2,000 one one student to over 2,000
 
03:22:54.110 --> 03:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
students would receive a different
 
03:22:54.120 --> 03:22:55.590 align:start position:0%
students would receive a different
waiting

03:22:55.590 --> 03:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
waiting
 
03:22:59.630 --> 03:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
Factor where the the um
 
03:23:03.389 --> 03:23:03.399 align:start position:0%
uh where the smallest have a little bit
 
03:23:05.269 --> 03:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
higher weights associated with them
 
03:23:08.110 --> 03:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
going down to over 2,000 there's no
 
03:23:08.120 --> 03:23:10.189 align:start position:0%
going down to over 2,000 there's no
additional

03:23:10.189 --> 03:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
additional
 
03:23:13.670 --> 03:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
weight and it's hard to it's hard to
 
03:23:16.189 --> 03:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
read this from the looking at the the
 
03:23:17.870 --> 03:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
weight themselves because the weights
 
03:23:21.469 --> 03:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
are defined as a line that would go
 
03:23:24.189 --> 03:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
between um so looking at the first one
 
03:23:29.030 --> 03:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
between 1 and 200 it would be a a
 
03:23:32.790 --> 03:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
decreasing um a a a a negative sloping
 
03:23:37.110 --> 03:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
line and that negative slope is is
 
03:23:42.510 --> 03:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
defined as um you know y = mx+b so so
 
03:23:45.830 --> 03:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
you know M you know the the formula for
 
03:23:48.229 --> 03:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
a slope Bri mhm that's what you're
 
03:23:50.710 --> 03:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
looking at here
 
03:23:54.030 --> 03:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
0.451 multiplied by adma adma would be
 
03:23:58.070 --> 03:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
the xais the weight would be the Y AIS
 
03:24:02.349 --> 03:24:02.359 align:start position:0%
and B would be the Y intercept so yeah I
 
03:24:04.670 --> 03:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
mean I love this right I mean this is
 
03:24:07.229 --> 03:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
and The Intercept is higher for smaller
 
03:24:09.750 --> 03:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
smaller districts
 
03:24:11.630 --> 03:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's going to be more
 
03:24:14.550 --> 03:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
advantageous for smaller schools um
 
03:24:16.510 --> 03:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
based on the based on the starting from
 
03:24:18.590 --> 03:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
a higher point and then going down as
 
03:24:21.150 --> 03:24:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:23.870 --> 03:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
students yes go ahead
 
03:24:26.710 --> 03:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
um back again to question of Co-op or
 
03:24:30.630 --> 03:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
school districts um my Co-op um each of
 
03:24:35.030 --> 03:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
the um small towns have one or two
 
03:24:38.590 --> 03:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
elementary schools in their town but
 
03:24:41.950 --> 03:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
there's one Regional Middle School one
 
03:24:45.030 --> 03:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
Regional High School so how do you work
 
03:24:49.269 --> 03:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
that for each individual town in their
 
03:24:51.990 --> 03:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
budget because they you know they've got
 
03:24:54.790 --> 03:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
a certain population within the middle
 
03:24:56.750 --> 03:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
school and within the high school but
 
03:24:58.950 --> 03:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
it's not the total number in the high
 
03:24:58.960 --> 03:25:00.990 align:start position:0%
it's not the total number in the high
school

03:25:00.990 --> 03:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:25:03.349 --> 03:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
school right but they still have a a
 
03:25:04.790 --> 03:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
number of students that are at the
 
03:25:07.229 --> 03:25:07.239 align:start position:0%
middle school or high school that uh
 
03:25:09.510 --> 03:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
that are attending so they get a they
 
03:25:12.990 --> 03:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
get a share uh the the they have their
 
03:25:15.950 --> 03:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
local share and their state share right
 
03:25:18.189 --> 03:25:18.199 align:start position:0%
so but for those students right do you
 
03:25:20.469 --> 03:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
have to adjust this to say that not the
 
03:25:22.790 --> 03:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
size of the school
 
03:25:26.469 --> 03:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
district but the population in some
 
03:25:28.349 --> 03:25:28.359 align:start position:0%
cases well I see what you're saying of
 
03:25:30.150 --> 03:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
the students going to that Regional
 
03:25:31.870 --> 03:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
School and that's what we debated I
 
03:25:33.349 --> 03:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
think we had this exact conversation two
 
03:25:37.630 --> 03:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
years ago and it's so it's sort of um we
 
03:25:39.910 --> 03:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
we got hung up here two years ago um so
 
03:25:41.910 --> 03:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
to is we're talking about at the actual
 
03:25:46.309 --> 03:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
school um or grade level uh grade level
 
03:25:48.990 --> 03:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
basically what what kind quasi factor in
 
03:25:50.269 --> 03:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
uh a middle school versus High School
 
03:25:52.670 --> 03:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
Etc um but no when the way I'm reading
 
03:25:56.150 --> 03:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is um it's not about school
 
03:25:58.269 --> 03:25:58.279 align:start position:0%
it's about school district so Governor
 
03:26:00.710 --> 03:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
Wentworth in its entirety is just a
 
03:26:01.990 --> 03:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
school district with x amount of
 
03:26:03.790 --> 03:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
students and it it gets plot it's get
 
03:26:06.790 --> 03:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
plotted on here um it doesn't uh it
 
03:26:08.309 --> 03:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't factor in whether you have a
 
03:26:10.070 --> 03:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
high school or local elementary schools
 
03:26:11.910 --> 03:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
it just looks at Governor wwor as a
 
03:26:14.110 --> 03:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
district in its entirety um that's how
 
03:26:18.630 --> 03:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:20.870 --> 03:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
so it would not um if it was done at the
 
03:26:20.880 --> 03:26:22.030 align:start position:0%
so it would not um if it was done at the
school

03:26:22.030 --> 03:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:26:24.750 --> 03:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
level and if it was how do you work it
 
03:26:27.990 --> 03:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
for um wolfboro has two elementary
 
03:26:29.950 --> 03:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
schools but they're not their own
 
03:26:32.990 --> 03:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
District yes so they're so wolfboro is
 
03:26:36.630 --> 03:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
not considered uh oh what I'm doing is
 
03:26:37.950 --> 03:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the students from that
 
03:26:39.469 --> 03:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
live in wolfboro the way the formula
 
03:26:41.870 --> 03:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
works the students who live inm yes I'm
 
03:26:43.229 --> 03:26:43.239 align:start position:0%
looking at the admr so I'm taking the
 
03:26:44.750 --> 03:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
students that live in wolfboro say
 
03:26:47.110 --> 03:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
there's 50 and I'm going well there are
 
03:26:50.030 --> 03:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
part of Governor Wentworth Governor
 
03:26:53.550 --> 03:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
Wentworth is is is um I don't know how
 
03:26:55.510 --> 03:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
many admr for governor WTH is but
 
03:26:57.590 --> 03:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
whatever it is whatever it plots on this
 
03:27:01.189 --> 03:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
these buckets um I'm treating them all
 
03:27:03.189 --> 03:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
I'm adding them all is
 
03:27:06.510 --> 03:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
that um is that what you're doing today
 
03:27:10.550 --> 03:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
with the current um um state adequacy
 
03:27:13.070 --> 03:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
grants it's always admr and it's always
 
03:27:15.429 --> 03:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's the same it's the same as
 
03:27:18.349 --> 03:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
what you're doing now under the the yeah
 
03:27:19.630 --> 03:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
the only thing difference when in this
 
03:27:21.750 --> 03:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
bill versus what we do currently is we
 
03:27:24.590 --> 03:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
never um there's no current weight or
 
03:27:26.189 --> 03:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
metric that looks at school district
 
03:27:28.150 --> 03:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
it's purely mun when we're doing the
 
03:27:30.469 --> 03:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
current formula this one uh requires a
 
03:27:30.479 --> 03:27:31.349 align:start position:0%
current formula this one uh requires a
little

03:27:31.349 --> 03:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
little
 
03:27:34.150 --> 03:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
crosswalking taking the mmun data and
 
03:27:35.229 --> 03:27:35.239 align:start position:0%
and and bringing it to the school
 
03:27:38.710 --> 03:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
district level um and then factoring a
 
03:27:41.229 --> 03:27:41.239 align:start position:0%
weight so so that's a good point though
 
03:27:42.830 --> 03:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
that that maybe we should make that
 
03:27:48.870 --> 03:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:53.349 --> 03:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
a in line 16 through through 24 I'm
 
03:27:55.910 --> 03:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
sorry 16 through
 
03:27:58.229 --> 03:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
26 let me go all the way down to 16
 
03:28:02.630 --> 03:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
through 28 is not the admr in the in the
 
03:28:04.750 --> 03:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
municipality but it's the admr of the
 
03:28:04.760 --> 03:28:07.389 align:start position:0%
municipality but it's the admr of the
district

03:28:07.389 --> 03:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
district
 
03:28:10.189 --> 03:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
right so because is that different than
 
03:28:14.469 --> 03:28:14.479 align:start position:0%
the admr that would be used on
 
03:28:17.269 --> 03:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
line8 uh
 
03:28:19.070 --> 03:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
pre-introduced price lunch would be
 
03:28:22.710 --> 03:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
different view of admr
 
03:28:25.870 --> 03:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so you could also have so what
 
03:28:27.510 --> 03:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
what it created some challenges for me
 
03:28:28.590 --> 03:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
when I first had to put this together
 
03:28:30.910 --> 03:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
was split districts are a challenge um
 
03:28:34.309 --> 03:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
so I had to a portion those out um so I
 
03:28:36.110 --> 03:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
still have to aor split districts are a
 
03:28:39.309 --> 03:28:39.319 align:start position:0%
whole other animal as far as
 
03:28:41.630 --> 03:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
um the town of wear has let's say they
 
03:28:44.550 --> 03:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
have 100 students um uh 50 of those
 
03:28:46.070 --> 03:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
students could be through going to the k
 
03:28:48.070 --> 03:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
to weight where district and they get a
 
03:28:50.189 --> 03:28:50.199 align:start position:0%
different weight and then 50 other
 
03:28:51.870 --> 03:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
students could be going to John stock
 
03:28:53.110 --> 03:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
and they get a different weight so I'm
 
03:28:54.429 --> 03:28:54.439 align:start position:0%
splitting those out currently and that's
 
03:28:57.830 --> 03:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:59.870 --> 03:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
bill but yeah it's a little it's it's
 
03:29:02.630 --> 03:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
Unique in a sense it's not how we um we
 
03:29:03.910 --> 03:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
in the current law we always stick
 
03:29:05.550 --> 03:29:05.560 align:start position:0%
within the world of mun and we never
 
03:29:07.950 --> 03:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
look at school district but in this bill
 
03:29:09.990 --> 03:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
we are looking at school district
 
03:29:12.229 --> 03:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
information and bringing it down to the
 
03:29:14.070 --> 03:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
mun level um looking at students
 
03:29:15.550 --> 03:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
essentially and where they attend what
 
03:29:18.229 --> 03:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
school district they belong to um and
 
03:29:21.030 --> 03:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
and since it's admr it shouldn't make a
 
03:29:23.910 --> 03:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
difference for Town tuition oh correct
 
03:29:25.110 --> 03:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
yeah that and that's the key thing when
 
03:29:27.830 --> 03:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
youever you talk about adma admr admr is
 
03:29:29.910 --> 03:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
how our current systems designed so if
 
03:29:31.429 --> 03:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
you ever switch to an if you ever
 
03:29:32.910 --> 03:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
decided to switch to an adma funding
 
03:29:34.030 --> 03:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
model and mess up every tuition
 
03:29:36.150 --> 03:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
agreement in the state um so yeah
 
03:29:38.910 --> 03:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
keeping an admr keeps that tuition stuff
 
03:29:41.070 --> 03:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
clean that would be your desire for the
 
03:29:43.229 --> 03:29:43.239 align:start position:0%
legis uh you know I think I think um I
 
03:29:44.389 --> 03:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
don't do tuition agreements I think
 
03:29:47.269 --> 03:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
every school district would be uh
 
03:29:50.150 --> 03:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
admr keeps it pretty pretty clean yeah
 
03:29:52.389 --> 03:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
keep it at admr there's a lot of schools
 
03:29:54.670 --> 03:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
tuition right and we don't want to mess
 
03:29:54.680 --> 03:29:55.710 align:start position:0%
tuition right and we don't want to mess
that

03:29:55.710 --> 03:29:55.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:29:59.189 --> 03:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
up okay other other
 
03:30:02.590 --> 03:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
uh questions regarding that that you
 
03:30:06.670 --> 03:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
might have for Mark at this time or you
 
03:30:08.469 --> 03:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
want to get in some of the tax stuff
 
03:30:10.510 --> 03:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
yeah uh the the one thing I'll say just
 
03:30:11.950 --> 03:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
um because there was a lot of testimony
 
03:30:14.590 --> 03:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
about it uh U and this this was a good
 
03:30:16.229 --> 03:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
segue probably into Bruce and and his
 
03:30:18.670 --> 03:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
work but um the negative tax rate
 
03:30:22.030 --> 03:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
conversation that we had yesterday um I
 
03:30:23.630 --> 03:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
just was just it's always interesting
 
03:30:25.070 --> 03:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
when we do see a negative tax rate
 
03:30:26.830 --> 03:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
because there's negative negative tax
 
03:30:28.710 --> 03:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
rates caused by swept um but I think
 
03:30:30.349 --> 03:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
Windsor is an interesting example I just
 
03:30:31.389 --> 03:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
wanted to use I don't know if it was
 
03:30:33.990 --> 03:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
discussed yesterday um
 
03:30:38.110 --> 03:30:38.120 align:start position:0%
Windsor um put a lot of appropriated a
 
03:30:40.110 --> 03:30:40.120 align:start position:0%
lot of funding for their school district
 
03:30:40.950 --> 03:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
because they thought they were going to
 
03:30:42.110 --> 03:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
have more students that they were going
 
03:30:43.870 --> 03:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
have to send tuition bills uh tuition
 
03:30:46.830 --> 03:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
out um but then those they made an ER
 
03:30:50.110 --> 03:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
and so they budgeted a lot of local
 
03:30:53.790 --> 03:30:53.800 align:start position:0%
money um uh to fund their tuition bills
 
03:30:55.309 --> 03:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
but then those students were never there
 
03:30:56.750 --> 03:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
so they never had to pay those tuition
 
03:30:58.630 --> 03:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
bills which resulted in them having to
 
03:31:00.830 --> 03:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
give money back to the taxpayers which
 
03:31:03.830 --> 03:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
resulted in a negative tax rate so it's
 
03:31:05.550 --> 03:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
just like when we talk about examples of
 
03:31:07.910 --> 03:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
negative tax rates um most of the
 
03:31:10.229 --> 03:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
negative tax rates are caused by uh
 
03:31:12.990 --> 03:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
essentially swept money that uh a tiny
 
03:31:14.990 --> 03:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
school district can't use but there are
 
03:31:17.550 --> 03:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
some instances like the town of Windsor
 
03:31:18.950 --> 03:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
where they are actually educating
 
03:31:22.309 --> 03:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
students um and they have excess money
 
03:31:24.510 --> 03:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
coming in so that was just one
 
03:31:26.550 --> 03:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
peculiarity that came up yesterday
 
03:31:29.790 --> 03:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
during uh during the hearing
 
03:31:33.429 --> 03:31:33.439 align:start position:0%
but we have a possibility that a
 
03:31:37.590 --> 03:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
district May split up of a new found um
 
03:31:40.469 --> 03:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
with Bridgewater going its own way gr
 
03:31:43.229 --> 03:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
and Hein following along with them will
 
03:31:46.910 --> 03:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
this impact that at all
 
03:31:49.349 --> 03:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
this bill impact impacted District
 
03:31:51.870 --> 03:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
splitting up way we're yeah anything
 
03:31:54.389 --> 03:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
we're doing here that that deals with
 
03:31:57.110 --> 03:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
this weighted formula right here um
 
03:32:00.389 --> 03:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
would have imp fact impact new found no
 
03:32:02.870 --> 03:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't impact so adequacy always
 
03:32:05.750 --> 03:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
admr always calculated at the Town level
 
03:32:08.590 --> 03:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
um it would impact it would impact
 
03:32:13.309 --> 03:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
um uh it would impact the um uh it
 
03:32:16.229 --> 03:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
talking about this formula um what
 
03:32:17.990 --> 03:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
school district they belong to so those
 
03:32:20.710 --> 03:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
particular weights which is a section um
 
03:32:22.349 --> 03:32:22.359 align:start position:0%
I think
 
03:32:27.030 --> 03:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:29.150 --> 03:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
context so when I tally up all the
 
03:32:31.870 --> 03:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
weights currently in the in the bill
 
03:32:31.880 --> 03:32:32.750 align:start position:0%
weights currently in the in the bill
there's

03:32:32.750 --> 03:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:32:36.229 --> 03:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
432,000 weights and I take 40 432,000
 
03:32:38.070 --> 03:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
weights and I uh multiply by the
 
03:32:40.269 --> 03:32:40.279 align:start position:0%
universal base Aid um and that's how
 
03:32:41.389 --> 03:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
this basically how the foundation
 
03:32:43.150 --> 03:32:43.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget
 
03:32:43.160 --> 03:32:44.830 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget
Works

03:32:44.830 --> 03:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
Works
 
03:32:47.870 --> 03:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
um so almost none of the weights would
 
03:32:50.349 --> 03:32:50.359 align:start position:0%
be affected except for what we just
 
03:32:54.469 --> 03:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
discussed you live in Bristol you attend
 
03:32:58.670 --> 03:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
Newfound uh uh Newfound has x amount of
 
03:33:00.910 --> 03:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
students when Bridgewater Hein and
 
03:33:02.950 --> 03:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
groten are in right so now they're a
 
03:33:05.070 --> 03:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
smaller School District so now they're
 
03:33:07.030 --> 03:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
going to potentially get both
 
03:33:08.389 --> 03:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
communities would potentially get more
 
03:33:11.110 --> 03:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
weights this is just yeah you know just
 
03:33:12.750 --> 03:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
the way it plays out because it's it
 
03:33:15.389 --> 03:33:15.399 align:start position:0%
benefits smaller school districts um
 
03:33:16.269 --> 03:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
well there you
 
03:33:17.750 --> 03:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
just yeah so that that would be but but
 
03:33:20.349 --> 03:33:20.359 align:start position:0%
again that's 41,000 weights that would
 
03:33:23.070 --> 03:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
be kind of messed with out of
 
03:33:26.870 --> 03:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
4 432,000 so it would it would have a an
 
03:33:28.670 --> 03:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
impact but uh it would be I don't know
 
03:33:30.030 --> 03:33:30.040 align:start position:0%
how much it would the magnitude of it I
 
03:33:32.269 --> 03:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
can't really speak to yeah okay are
 
03:33:34.189 --> 03:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
there any other questions for Mark right
 
03:33:36.349 --> 03:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
now well let's swing it over to the
 
03:33:39.990 --> 03:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
other side of the room here and and uh
 
03:33:43.670 --> 03:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:48.110 --> 03:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:50.189 --> 03:33:50.199 align:start position:0%
okay we we we had uh some of the
 
03:33:53.389 --> 03:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
questions uh uh represent luno why don't
 
03:33:55.550 --> 03:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
you started out with some of the issues
 
03:33:57.710 --> 03:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
that we did discuss and that we might
 
03:34:01.189 --> 03:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
get some resolution from Dr now right so
 
03:34:04.429 --> 03:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chair so um one of the
 
03:34:07.870 --> 03:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
areas that that uh I talked that we we
 
03:34:09.510 --> 03:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
talked about a little bit in the hall
 
03:34:13.229 --> 03:34:13.239 align:start position:0%
yesterday was um find out do you uh by
 
03:34:16.750 --> 03:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
the way do you have a copy of 1586
 
03:34:21.750 --> 03:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:29.189 --> 03:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:32.870 --> 03:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
33 and
 
03:34:37.670 --> 03:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
specifically yeah lines 30 and 31 um
 
03:34:39.950 --> 03:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
where it talks about $5 per thousand of
 
03:34:41.870 --> 03:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
equalized assessed valuation of all
 
03:34:45.750 --> 03:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
property tax will pursuant to 768 and
 
03:34:50.670 --> 03:34:50.680 align:start position:0%
and um and I I I think from the from the
 
03:34:51.790 --> 03:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
this is what we were talking about from
 
03:34:53.469 --> 03:34:53.479 align:start position:0%
the time we drafted this bill three
 
03:34:56.269 --> 03:34:56.279 align:start position:0%
years ago and we had $220 billion in
 
03:34:59.030 --> 03:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
Statewide taxable property and now we've
 
03:35:00.950 --> 03:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
got 340 billion I think if I'm
 
03:35:03.309 --> 03:35:03.319 align:start position:0%
remembering the numbers I heard that
 
03:35:08.990 --> 03:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:13.429 --> 03:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
um is is a substantially increased tax
 
03:35:15.950 --> 03:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
burden due to the rise in property
 
03:35:20.630 --> 03:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
valuations so so we're thinking that
 
03:35:24.110 --> 03:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
that we may need to have a paragraph in
 
03:35:28.670 --> 03:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
here that that allow that provides the
 
03:35:31.550 --> 03:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
calculation of that tax rate per
 
03:35:37.429 --> 03:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
thousand based on a a um you know if
 
03:35:39.790 --> 03:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
we're if we're going with a fiscal
 
03:35:42.510 --> 03:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
policy and you plug in whatever number
 
03:35:43.910 --> 03:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
you want but the number that keeps
 
03:35:47.670 --> 03:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
coming up um came up yesterday is a 42%
 
03:35:53.429 --> 03:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
State share and a 58% local share of
 
03:35:53.439 --> 03:35:54.990 align:start position:0%
State share and a 58% local share of
the

03:35:54.990 --> 03:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:35:57.630 --> 03:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
total um uh
 
03:36:01.110 --> 03:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh state and local cost so not the
 
03:36:04.429 --> 03:36:04.439 align:start position:0%
federal part but the the $3.4 billion
 
03:36:07.229 --> 03:36:07.239 align:start position:0%
yep I'm sort of finger in the wind close
 
03:36:09.150 --> 03:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
so so it would
 
03:36:12.910 --> 03:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
be it it so that F that number there on
 
03:36:16.110 --> 03:36:16.120 align:start position:0%
line 30 is to be the local share
 
03:36:17.510 --> 03:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
of that
 
03:36:20.070 --> 03:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
$3.4 billion and if that's supposed to
 
03:36:23.790 --> 03:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
be 58% of that then how do
 
03:36:27.110 --> 03:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
you how do you calculate the tax rate
 
03:36:28.950 --> 03:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
and it's probably a lot more complicated
 
03:36:31.670 --> 03:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
than my simplistic way which is which
 
03:36:36.870 --> 03:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
would be 58% of $3.4 billion divided by
 
03:36:40.030 --> 03:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
the total Statewide property
 
03:36:43.870 --> 03:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
valuation yeah you know something like
 
03:36:48.590 --> 03:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
that I'm from a municipal Bureau dr's
 
03:36:51.269 --> 03:36:51.279 align:start position:0%
perspective I think initially for us
 
03:36:54.590 --> 03:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
it's going to be helpful to just review
 
03:36:58.670 --> 03:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
right now very quickly the chronology of
 
03:37:02.910 --> 03:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
setting a local school tax rate under
 
03:37:05.389 --> 03:37:05.399 align:start position:0%
current law current conditions and then
 
03:37:07.110 --> 03:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
compare that to what this bill is
 
03:37:08.950 --> 03:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
attempting to do just to make sure that
 
03:37:11.630 --> 03:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
we're first of all understanding the
 
03:37:14.229 --> 03:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
flow through this bill of what needs to
 
03:37:16.189 --> 03:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
happen okay
 
03:37:17.389 --> 03:37:17.399 align:start position:0%
you move the microphone just a little
 
03:37:19.150 --> 03:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
bit closer
 
03:37:19.160 --> 03:37:23.349 align:start position:0%
bit closer
possibly

03:37:23.349 --> 03:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:26.469 --> 03:37:26.479 align:start position:0%
certainly how's that yeah better yeah
 
03:37:29.150 --> 03:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
and and and so so Bruce I think that's I
 
03:37:33.389 --> 03:37:33.399 align:start position:0%
think that's that's good because the um
 
03:37:37.030 --> 03:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
the the the tax rate that you would be
 
03:37:39.189 --> 03:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
calculating would
 
03:37:43.070 --> 03:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
be just as it says here um for each
 
03:37:46.950 --> 03:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
municipality the amount that is the less
 
03:37:51.030 --> 03:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
of and one would be
 
03:37:55.870 --> 03:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
um x per thousand where X is based
 
03:38:02.790 --> 03:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:05.990 --> 03:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
billion right or
 
03:38:11.189 --> 03:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
or or up to the um the not to exceed the
 
03:38:13.630 --> 03:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget which is
 
03:38:16.349 --> 03:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
defined elsewhere in here so there's a
 
03:38:19.990 --> 03:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
ceiling to what that calculated tax rate
 
03:38:22.990 --> 03:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
would be right in each
 
03:38:26.309 --> 03:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
municipality I understand I think and
 
03:38:28.389 --> 03:38:28.399 align:start position:0%
and then beyond that there could even be
 
03:38:31.950 --> 03:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
a local education property tax should
 
03:38:34.030 --> 03:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
the municipalities or the school
 
03:38:36.309 --> 03:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
district vote to have something in
 
03:38:38.630 --> 03:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
addition to the foundation operating
 
03:38:42.670 --> 03:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
budget right this from three years ago
 
03:38:46.990 --> 03:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
and again now the bill seems to have
 
03:38:51.030 --> 03:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
some alterations to the way we at Dr
 
03:38:53.389 --> 03:38:53.399 align:start position:0%
would understand setting the property
 
03:38:56.030 --> 03:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
tax rate so if you will let's let's
 
03:38:57.910 --> 03:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
Place ourselves right now in the midst
 
03:39:00.750 --> 03:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
of a school district's budget work
 
03:39:02.590 --> 03:39:02.600 align:start position:0%
they're getting ready for the hearings
 
03:39:05.229 --> 03:39:05.239 align:start position:0%
and so forth um to the Department of
 
03:39:07.349 --> 03:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
Revenue even though we might know
 
03:39:09.670 --> 03:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
something because of the tax portal and
 
03:39:11.309 --> 03:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
the fact that districts are entering
 
03:39:15.630 --> 03:39:15.640 align:start position:0%
data so we're aware but right now
 
03:39:18.309 --> 03:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
we're just awaiting results I'm going to
 
03:39:20.110 --> 03:39:20.120 align:start position:0%
stop for a second and shift back to the
 
03:39:22.790 --> 03:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
bill see if I have this right in the
 
03:39:25.670 --> 03:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
future should this pass as written or at
 
03:39:27.510 --> 03:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
least in terms of its
 
03:39:31.349 --> 03:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
chronology Mark and and education would
 
03:39:31.359 --> 03:39:32.550 align:start position:0%
chronology Mark and and education would
have

03:39:32.550 --> 03:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:39:35.389 --> 03:39:35.399 align:start position:0%
calculated a uh Foundation
 
03:39:38.830 --> 03:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget a number that the
 
03:39:40.870 --> 03:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
school district would
 
03:39:44.150 --> 03:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
know about earlier than right now into
 
03:39:47.070 --> 03:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
the from the fall at it mentioned by no
 
03:39:49.750 --> 03:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh there's a date November 1st is it in
 
03:39:51.630 --> 03:39:51.640 align:start position:0%
other words education is going to
 
03:39:54.229 --> 03:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
utilize the bills mechanics to come up
 
03:39:57.070 --> 03:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
with a dollar amount School District
 
03:40:01.590 --> 03:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
knows it must write an Appropriations
 
03:40:06.510 --> 03:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
budget that is at least that large okay
 
03:40:09.030 --> 03:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
I think is that would be a correct
 
03:40:11.150 --> 03:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
reading of what the bill was trying to
 
03:40:13.830 --> 03:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
accomplish at that point in time okay
 
03:40:17.710 --> 03:40:17.720 align:start position:0%
okay from Dr 's perspective um we're on
 
03:40:19.870 --> 03:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
the sidelines at that point if I'm
 
03:40:22.309 --> 03:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
reading it correctly we don't have
 
03:40:24.510 --> 03:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
anything to do Mark and his team can
 
03:40:26.870 --> 03:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
literally take whatever the Bill's rate
 
03:40:30.349 --> 03:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
is the legislation would tell him and
 
03:40:32.630 --> 03:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
utilizing already prepared equalized
 
03:40:35.309 --> 03:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
valuation numbers and the formula is
 
03:40:37.710 --> 03:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
embedded in the in the legislation to
 
03:40:40.990 --> 03:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
create that dollar amount that a
 
03:40:44.110 --> 03:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
district would need to understand as it
 
03:40:46.550 --> 03:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
goes through its bud budgeting process
 
03:40:49.710 --> 03:40:49.720 align:start position:0%
and brings it out to uh a vote with the
 
03:40:51.830 --> 03:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
the voters see I think that's that's a
 
03:40:53.269 --> 03:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
little bit different I want to make sure
 
03:40:55.750 --> 03:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
I I understand what you just said Bruce
 
03:40:59.790 --> 03:40:59.800 align:start position:0%
so so the um the dep the Department of
 
03:41:03.349 --> 03:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
Education would calculate the the sum of
 
03:41:06.030 --> 03:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
all Foundation opportunity
 
03:41:09.070 --> 03:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
budgets so that's the number that would
 
03:41:12.229 --> 03:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
finger in the air approach $3.4 billion
 
03:41:13.910 --> 03:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
doar or something like that based on
 
03:41:16.710 --> 03:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
current current um
 
03:41:20.990 --> 03:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
spending and and then the Department of
 
03:41:23.750 --> 03:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration
 
03:41:26.469 --> 03:41:26.479 align:start position:0%
would use that
 
03:41:31.710 --> 03:41:31.720 align:start position:0%
number and apply a a fiscal
 
03:41:34.830 --> 03:41:34.840 align:start position:0%
policy multiplier to that and that would
 
03:41:36.189 --> 03:41:36.199 align:start position:0%
be the the
 
03:41:40.189 --> 03:41:40.199 align:start position:0%
58% the local share to the total number
 
03:41:42.110 --> 03:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
not to the individual Foundation
 
03:41:44.830 --> 03:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity budgets this would be novel
 
03:41:46.830 --> 03:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
approach for Department of Revenue I
 
03:41:49.349 --> 03:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
mean currently the school district acts
 
03:41:52.590 --> 03:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
independently within the law in building
 
03:41:55.870 --> 03:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
out a recommended budget or when I say
 
03:41:58.389 --> 03:41:58.399 align:start position:0%
that I'm concentrating on Appropriations
 
03:42:00.590 --> 03:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
yeah the S because the bill at times
 
03:42:00.600 --> 03:42:02.110 align:start position:0%
yeah the S because the bill at times
mentions

03:42:02.110 --> 03:42:02.120 align:start position:0%
mentions
 
03:42:04.990 --> 03:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
spending and and that would be right
 
03:42:07.670 --> 03:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
approved appropriation lead to spending
 
03:42:11.670 --> 03:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
So currently if this bill was in
 
03:42:14.269 --> 03:42:14.279 align:start position:0%
place I didn't know I couldn't see the
 
03:42:15.510 --> 03:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue was is doing
 
03:42:19.309 --> 03:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
anything in this time frame other than
 
03:42:19.319 --> 03:42:20.990 align:start position:0%
anything in this time frame other than
perhaps

03:42:20.990 --> 03:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
03:42:23.710 --> 03:42:23.720 align:start position:0%
observing whether when Mark would I say
 
03:42:26.670 --> 03:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
Mark when education would prepare the
 
03:42:29.790 --> 03:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity the minimum that
 
03:42:35.110 --> 03:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
a district must uh raise or I should say
 
03:42:37.910 --> 03:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate we would be aware of it but
 
03:42:40.349 --> 03:42:40.359 align:start position:0%
currently whatever a district decides to
 
03:42:42.229 --> 03:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
budget in an appropriation we don't have
 
03:42:44.429 --> 03:42:44.439 align:start position:0%
a say about that we don't intervene so
 
03:42:45.670 --> 03:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
that would be n
 
03:42:47.590 --> 03:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
for us to at that point as the budget
 
03:42:50.830 --> 03:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
comes into being in say right now in
 
03:42:52.389 --> 03:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
January it's getting ready to go to
 
03:42:56.469 --> 03:42:56.479 align:start position:0%
hearing for Dr to examine it in any way
 
03:42:59.790 --> 03:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
shape or form to evaluate it and take
 
03:42:59.800 --> 03:43:00.830 align:start position:0%
shape or form to evaluate it and take
any

03:43:00.830 --> 03:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:43:03.189 --> 03:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
action would be unusual other than a
 
03:43:05.309 --> 03:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
very technical matter of you know you
 
03:43:07.349 --> 03:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
put something in the tax portal for the
 
03:43:08.910 --> 03:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
budget but you have it in the wrong
 
03:43:12.349 --> 03:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
account code other than that we're
 
03:43:15.189 --> 03:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
neutral to those numbers so if the bill
 
03:43:17.630 --> 03:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
is asking Department of Revenue at that
 
03:43:21.429 --> 03:43:21.439 align:start position:0%
stage to say aha we see what you're
 
03:43:23.750 --> 03:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
appropriating and this is on a district
 
03:43:26.790 --> 03:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
because we operate our an our work
 
03:43:29.349 --> 03:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't really aggregate until later
 
03:43:31.070 --> 03:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
we're looking at individual districts
 
03:43:33.550 --> 03:43:33.560 align:start position:0%
and their budgets so we would be looking
 
03:43:36.389 --> 03:43:36.399 align:start position:0%
at a school district's recommended
 
03:43:39.030 --> 03:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
budget in light of a
 
03:43:42.189 --> 03:43:42.199 align:start position:0%
predetermined minimum and even there as
 
03:43:43.830 --> 03:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
I said this would be novel that we would
 
03:43:47.030 --> 03:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
look at and say your Appropriations in
 
03:43:48.830 --> 03:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
your school budget even before you've
 
03:43:52.349 --> 03:43:52.359 align:start position:0%
gone out for the vote is somehow not
 
03:43:56.149 --> 03:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
meeting this minimum is that the intent
 
03:43:58.710 --> 03:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
of the bill is for us to check that the
 
03:43:58.720 --> 03:43:59.910 align:start position:0%
of the bill is for us to check that the
the

03:43:59.910 --> 03:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:44:03.950 --> 03:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
the uh let me say how I this so the
 
03:44:06.389 --> 03:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
found I I think what I'm hearing is that
 
03:44:08.630 --> 03:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
is that the Department of Education
 
03:44:10.550 --> 03:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
would need to calculate the foundation
 
03:44:13.030 --> 03:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity budgets certainly before the
 
03:44:16.590 --> 03:44:16.600 align:start position:0%
budget cycle for school districts which
 
03:44:19.030 --> 03:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
starts let's say October 1st November
 
03:44:20.990 --> 03:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
1st something like that but but would
 
03:44:22.830 --> 03:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
would you'd have to have the the
 
03:44:24.630 --> 03:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budgets for every
 
03:44:28.429 --> 03:44:28.439 align:start position:0%
District calculated before that yes um
 
03:44:31.710 --> 03:44:31.720 align:start position:0%
so one way to do this is to have use lag
 
03:44:34.710 --> 03:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
in the data so and that's typically and
 
03:44:36.269 --> 03:44:36.279 align:start position:0%
the aggregation process that's not in
 
03:44:37.469 --> 03:44:37.479 align:start position:0%
the bill as proposed right you're
 
03:44:39.469 --> 03:44:39.479 align:start position:0%
talking about amending this is your pro
 
03:44:43.110 --> 03:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
this is yeah your process I mean the the
 
03:44:44.790 --> 03:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
the let let me let me make it clear what
 
03:44:47.630 --> 03:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
the what the Bill's intent is not that
 
03:44:50.309 --> 03:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
it is not the Bill's intent for every
 
03:44:55.149 --> 03:44:55.159 align:start position:0%
local school district to for every um
 
03:44:57.790 --> 03:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
local property taxpayer or the local
 
03:44:59.670 --> 03:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
property taxpayer School District to pay
 
03:45:02.990 --> 03:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
for 58% of their Foundation opportunity
 
03:45:06.429 --> 03:45:06.439 align:start position:0%
budget Statewide AC
 
03:45:08.670 --> 03:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
Statewide the state would be responsible
 
03:45:08.680 --> 03:45:09.790 align:start position:0%
Statewide the state would be responsible
for

03:45:09.790 --> 03:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:45:12.950 --> 03:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
42% the locals would be responsible for
 
03:45:17.030 --> 03:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
58% but obviously depending upon um
 
03:45:20.229 --> 03:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
valuations and you know property Val
 
03:45:23.990 --> 03:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
property um yeah assessed property in
 
03:45:26.469 --> 03:45:26.479 align:start position:0%
each of those districts that those
 
03:45:28.790 --> 03:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
percentages would vary the the the
 
03:45:30.510 --> 03:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
dollar the
 
03:45:33.910 --> 03:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
tax the tax rate per thousand would be
 
03:45:37.269 --> 03:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
the same across the board I think one of
 
03:45:38.389 --> 03:45:38.399 align:start position:0%
the and I think Bruce and I need to
 
03:45:40.590 --> 03:45:40.600 align:start position:0%
spend more time thinking about this um
 
03:45:42.510 --> 03:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
the aggregation process the calculating
 
03:45:44.070 --> 03:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
the grant that's all education that
 
03:45:46.070 --> 03:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
would assume that's responsibility not
 
03:45:48.510 --> 03:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
dr's responsibility um I think one of
 
03:45:51.349 --> 03:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
the other mix matches we have that would
 
03:45:55.870 --> 03:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
be more of dr's responsibility is um a
 
03:46:00.429 --> 03:46:00.439 align:start position:0%
$5 tax rate per thousand
 
03:46:04.030 --> 03:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
um it eventually a tax rate turns into a
 
03:46:06.149 --> 03:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
tax effort and I think that's where
 
03:46:09.030 --> 03:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
maybe uh things could get a
 
03:46:14.469 --> 03:46:14.479 align:start position:0%
little uh dicey is is basically a $5 tax
 
03:46:18.670 --> 03:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
rate on EV raises hypothetical dollars
 
03:46:19.990 --> 03:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
that the local is actually going to
 
03:46:21.870 --> 03:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
raise and to determine if the locals
 
03:46:23.750 --> 03:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
actually raised it is actually a Dr
 
03:46:26.349 --> 03:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
process and I think Bruce and I have
 
03:46:28.229 --> 03:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
talked whether are there opportunities
 
03:46:30.550 --> 03:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
for this to create weird Loops in the
 
03:46:32.750 --> 03:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
system where we're
 
03:46:35.229 --> 03:46:35.239 align:start position:0%
now basically saying budgets are not
 
03:46:37.229 --> 03:46:37.239 align:start position:0%
sufficient and I don't know we haven't
 
03:46:38.750 --> 03:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
since the Bill's never been enacted it's
 
03:46:41.550 --> 03:46:41.560 align:start position:0%
like hard for St so so you know let let
 
03:46:44.309 --> 03:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
me let me um let me sort of step forward
 
03:46:45.389 --> 03:46:45.399 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
03:46:45.399 --> 03:46:47.950 align:start position:0%
a little bit
the

03:46:47.950 --> 03:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:50.710 --> 03:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
there's we we may we may be jumping too
 
03:46:53.229 --> 03:46:53.239 align:start position:0%
far uh getting into something where the
 
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
bill does not get into the the reason
 
03:46:58.830 --> 03:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
this number is calculated is so that the
 
03:47:01.750 --> 03:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
department can calculate the grant the
 
03:47:04.429 --> 03:47:04.439 align:start position:0%
foundation Opportunity
 
03:47:06.790 --> 03:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
Grant yeah we're not talking about a
 
03:47:09.990 --> 03:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
separate tax line for the for the local
 
03:47:12.389 --> 03:47:12.399 align:start position:0%
contribution I I representative Luna I
 
03:47:14.950 --> 03:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
agree I as I looked at it I thought this
 
03:47:17.550 --> 03:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
in some ways functions mechanically for
 
03:47:21.030 --> 03:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
us or practically as does uh educations
 
03:47:24.349 --> 03:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
work with adequacy it comes up with an
 
03:47:27.950 --> 03:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
estimate right and it is a number um and
 
03:47:30.149 --> 03:47:30.159 align:start position:0%
and we come up with the swept warrant
 
03:47:33.070 --> 03:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
numbers in advance so it's also
 
03:47:35.670 --> 03:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
available to a school district so the
 
03:47:38.590 --> 03:47:38.600 align:start position:0%
idea that a foundation opportunity
 
03:47:42.030 --> 03:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
budget amount would be calculated by
 
03:47:45.149 --> 03:47:45.159 align:start position:0%
education in the same time frame make
 
03:47:47.590 --> 03:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
that makes perfect sense the other two
 
03:47:50.870 --> 03:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
things again we we developed the swept
 
03:47:53.950 --> 03:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
amounts um they were already available
 
03:47:55.590 --> 03:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
last year as early as September and
 
03:47:56.870 --> 03:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
they're they're given out through the
 
03:47:58.790 --> 03:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
warrants and so forth so districts know
 
03:48:01.750 --> 03:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
that by early November they know the
 
03:48:04.269 --> 03:48:04.279 align:start position:0%
adequa the current adequacy Aid uh
 
03:48:08.349 --> 03:48:08.359 align:start position:0%
estimates a solid number if this new
 
03:48:10.510 --> 03:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
number was introduced as
 
03:48:13.990 --> 03:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
well right now at that point nothing's
 
03:48:14.000 --> 03:48:15.269 align:start position:0%
well right now at that point nothing's
changing

03:48:15.269 --> 03:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
changing
 
03:48:17.750 --> 03:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
so far for Dr I just wanted to CL and
 
03:48:19.950 --> 03:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
see if if I'm point and I I think this
 
03:48:21.429 --> 03:48:21.439 align:start position:0%
could all be calculated at the
 
03:48:24.030 --> 03:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Education yeah I I I think
 
03:48:25.830 --> 03:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's not I don't know if it's if there's
 
03:48:28.510 --> 03:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
a role for Dr to play um and I don't
 
03:48:30.750 --> 03:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
know if the bill needs clean up to
 
03:48:33.469 --> 03:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
Define roles better but but that's I
 
03:48:35.189 --> 03:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
don't because at the end of the day
 
03:48:37.269 --> 03:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
you're calculating two things Mark
 
03:48:38.990 --> 03:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
you're calculating the foundation
 
03:48:41.269 --> 03:48:41.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget and then the
 
03:48:43.070 --> 03:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
foundation Opportunity
 
03:48:45.510 --> 03:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
Grant and the only the only thing that's
 
03:48:48.070 --> 03:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
different between those two numbers is
 
03:48:51.710 --> 03:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
this local contribution which based on
 
03:48:54.630 --> 03:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
this early draft okay is $5 per thousand
 
03:48:56.590 --> 03:48:56.600 align:start position:0%
of that Municipal Municipal
 
03:48:58.590 --> 03:48:58.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities valuation I think it's
 
03:49:03.030 --> 03:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
right there the novelty occurs to Dr the
 
03:49:05.990 --> 03:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
quote local contribution the tax dollars
 
03:49:08.590 --> 03:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
raised from the the the school
 
03:49:11.830 --> 03:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
district's voters right is only
 
03:49:15.389 --> 03:49:15.399 align:start position:0%
determined right now for Dr at the very
 
03:49:17.349 --> 03:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
end of our process of setting the tax
 
03:49:20.790 --> 03:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
rates it is the what's left has to be
 
03:49:22.830 --> 03:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
raised through that local school
 
03:49:25.910 --> 03:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
rate so introducing the idea that
 
03:49:28.630 --> 03:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
somehow the local contribution has to be
 
03:49:31.269 --> 03:49:31.279 align:start position:0%
a certain amount or a certain percentage
 
03:49:33.750 --> 03:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
or any kind of development like that at
 
03:49:36.910 --> 03:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
the beginning of this of the
 
03:49:40.070 --> 03:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
process that's novel and I didn't know
 
03:49:42.389 --> 03:49:42.399 align:start position:0%
that we had a role necessarily but if we
 
03:49:45.630 --> 03:49:45.640 align:start position:0%
did and it involved maybe I misread
 
03:49:47.670 --> 03:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
things maybe it was three years ago is
 
03:49:49.269 --> 03:49:49.279 align:start position:0%
the idea that if we have to try to
 
03:49:51.950 --> 03:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
figure out if a certain tax rate is
 
03:49:53.830 --> 03:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
going to accomplish a certain amount of
 
03:49:56.950 --> 03:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
tax dollars no no good because we
 
03:49:59.030 --> 03:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't iterate that way we weren't
 
03:50:00.790 --> 03:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
we're not built no I think I think this
 
03:50:02.670 --> 03:50:02.680 align:start position:0%
is a good conversation because I think
 
03:50:06.149 --> 03:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
it clarifies that that this section of
 
03:50:08.189 --> 03:50:08.199 align:start position:0%
calculating the foundation opportunity
 
03:50:10.550 --> 03:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
budget and the found Opportunity Grant
 
03:50:12.750 --> 03:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
all reside within the Department of
 
03:50:15.229 --> 03:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
Education and that that
 
03:50:17.189 --> 03:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
you know that the
 
03:50:20.590 --> 03:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
cooperation or the collaboration between
 
03:50:24.790 --> 03:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
um um nhed and the Dr is really to make
 
03:50:27.389 --> 03:50:27.399 align:start position:0%
sure that they're using the the property
 
03:50:30.870 --> 03:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
valuations that the most P published
 
03:50:32.469 --> 03:50:32.479 align:start position:0%
what whatever however you're doing it
 
03:50:36.710 --> 03:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
now y right yeah right if I might so if
 
03:50:38.349 --> 03:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
that's working the way it sounds like
 
03:50:40.870 --> 03:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
it's intended the school district would
 
03:50:43.030 --> 03:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
be entering into the budget setting
 
03:50:45.349 --> 03:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
process we're going to be
 
03:50:47.830 --> 03:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
indirectly aware because we have to be
 
03:50:50.550 --> 03:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
because of the tax Portal's approach but
 
03:50:53.269 --> 03:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
we're not intervening at all if there's
 
03:50:56.469 --> 03:50:56.479 align:start position:0%
any check or balance up to this point it
 
03:51:00.030 --> 03:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
seems to be on the local school district
 
03:51:02.389 --> 03:51:02.399 align:start position:0%
to make sure it's complying with the law
 
03:51:04.710 --> 03:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of the Appropriations budget
 
03:51:07.630 --> 03:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
it's putting forward that being said I
 
03:51:11.469 --> 03:51:11.479 align:start position:0%
did have a question on page eight
 
03:51:18.710 --> 03:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:21.710 --> 03:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
and that's this is exactly the same area
 
03:51:24.830 --> 03:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
right now it's very clear that this is
 
03:51:28.189 --> 03:51:28.199 align:start position:0%
dr's bwick right well no I think this is
 
03:51:31.469 --> 03:51:31.479 align:start position:0%
the um this is still in the department
 
03:51:33.510 --> 03:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
of Ed because this is the calculation of
 
03:51:36.670 --> 03:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
the grant so wait maybe I have the wrong
 
03:51:38.429 --> 03:51:38.439 align:start position:0%
but it says Dr it says Commissioner of
 
03:51:41.710 --> 03:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
Dr well then then uh do I have a wrong
 
03:51:45.510 --> 03:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
Edition or yeah yeah the commissioner of
 
03:51:48.790 --> 03:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue on Section 8 tax section right
 
03:51:50.990 --> 03:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's what well maybe I had a different
 
03:51:53.950 --> 03:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
P pagination I don't know well it says
 
03:51:54.870 --> 03:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of Revenue
 
03:51:56.830 --> 03:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
Administration shall compute the rate
 
03:51:58.830 --> 03:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
percentage of Taxation for school
 
03:52:02.510 --> 03:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
district purposes from such certificate
 
03:52:04.630 --> 03:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
I've asked Mark I believe I didn't have
 
03:52:05.950 --> 03:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
time to look at
 
03:52:08.309 --> 03:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
1984a but that certificate are the
 
03:52:10.830 --> 03:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
reports come into education we need the
 
03:52:12.510 --> 03:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
same we need the numbers but we're going
 
03:52:15.630 --> 03:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
to calculate the
 
03:52:18.030 --> 03:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
tax rate or rate percent of Taxation for
 
03:52:20.710 --> 03:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
school district purposes it's the next
 
03:52:23.910 --> 03:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
section that again this is novel for us
 
03:52:26.510 --> 03:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
because at that point in time now we're
 
03:52:29.510 --> 03:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
at in the fall of tax rate setting all
 
03:52:32.030 --> 03:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
of the bill has taken effect and done
 
03:52:32.040 --> 03:52:33.070 align:start position:0%
of the bill has taken effect and done
its

03:52:33.070 --> 03:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
its
 
03:52:35.830 --> 03:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
work we're going to look at the total
 
03:52:35.840 --> 03:52:37.110 align:start position:0%
work we're going to look at the total
approved

03:52:37.110 --> 03:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
approved
 
03:52:39.790 --> 03:52:39.800 align:start position:0%
Appropriations the total non-property
 
03:52:41.750 --> 03:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
tax revenues to offset those
 
03:52:43.229 --> 03:52:43.239 align:start position:0%
Appropriations we're going to end up
 
03:52:45.229 --> 03:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
with a net assessment or the taxes that
 
03:52:47.269 --> 03:52:47.279 align:start position:0%
need to be raised and we're going to use
 
03:52:50.309 --> 03:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
the locally uh assessed uh property
 
03:52:53.149 --> 03:52:53.159 align:start position:0%
value that's relevant to that t that
 
03:52:53.159 --> 03:52:54.269 align:start position:0%
value that's relevant to that t that
school

03:52:54.269 --> 03:52:54.279 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:52:57.309 --> 03:52:57.319 align:start position:0%
district to determine the local school
 
03:53:00.990 --> 03:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
rate that's a current approach but
 
03:53:05.590 --> 03:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
here I i' I'd like to hear you help me
 
03:53:08.389 --> 03:53:08.399 align:start position:0%
understand what this next section in
 
03:53:10.429 --> 03:53:10.439 align:start position:0%
this well next part of this section is
 
03:53:13.349 --> 03:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
attempting to do I I'll I'll read it for
 
03:53:15.750 --> 03:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
my own sake provide that no separate
 
03:53:18.550 --> 03:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
increment to the school district tax
 
03:53:21.630 --> 03:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
rate to raise funds for participating
 
03:53:23.750 --> 03:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities minimum of foundation
 
03:53:26.269 --> 03:53:26.279 align:start position:0%
budget contribution shall be
 
03:53:29.229 --> 03:53:29.239 align:start position:0%
required if the municipa let me stop
 
03:53:31.830 --> 03:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
there Y at this point in time we're not
 
03:53:35.229 --> 03:53:35.239 align:start position:0%
accustomed to having any thought of an
 
03:53:37.429 --> 03:53:37.439 align:start position:0%
increment we're about to set a t
 
03:53:40.550 --> 03:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
everything's done our currently but is
 
03:53:42.389 --> 03:53:42.399 align:start position:0%
this saying that at the time we go to
 
03:53:45.030 --> 03:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
set a tax rate it's possible
 
03:53:47.870 --> 03:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
that we have to check to see whether or
 
03:53:49.790 --> 03:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
not being a
 
03:53:52.550 --> 03:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
gatekeeper do we have a role to say wait
 
03:53:54.630 --> 03:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
we can't set the local school rate now
 
03:53:57.590 --> 03:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
this could be October or November
 
03:53:59.030 --> 03:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
because and that's the part I don't
 
03:54:00.990 --> 03:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
think I yeah see I don't I don't think
 
03:54:01.000 --> 03:54:03.710 align:start position:0%
think I yeah see I don't I don't think
that's

03:54:03.710 --> 03:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:06.630 --> 03:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that's the intent in
 
03:54:09.389 --> 03:54:09.399 align:start position:0%
here and I think we can clean up um this
 
03:54:11.429 --> 03:54:11.439 align:start position:0%
part section 8 and I think we can clean
 
03:54:15.309 --> 03:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
up the um the previous section
 
03:54:18.710 --> 03:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh on page
 
03:54:21.149 --> 03:54:21.159 align:start position:0%
six with respect to that because at the
 
03:54:24.110 --> 03:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
end of the day
 
03:54:27.710 --> 03:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
what the only the only thing that really
 
03:54:31.149 --> 03:54:31.159 align:start position:0%
matters through here is that a
 
03:54:34.070 --> 03:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
foundation Opportunity Grant is
 
03:54:35.990 --> 03:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
calculated by the Department of
 
03:54:38.070 --> 03:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
Education and communicated to the school
 
03:54:40.750 --> 03:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
districts by November
 
03:54:43.870 --> 03:54:43.880 align:start position:0%
1st uh I think the preliminary 15th is
 
03:54:49.469 --> 03:54:49.479 align:start position:0%
the November 15th and um and that um and
 
03:54:51.710 --> 03:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
that the foundation Opportunity
 
03:54:57.110 --> 03:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
Grant uh is based on this local minimum
 
03:54:59.429 --> 03:54:59.439 align:start position:0%
contribution right
 
03:55:06.510 --> 03:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
that is calculated based on a Statewide
 
03:55:10.229 --> 03:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
share and then applied at a municipal
 
03:55:12.469 --> 03:55:12.479 align:start position:0%
level and I think the department can do
 
03:55:15.429 --> 03:55:15.439 align:start position:0%
that and that local minimum
 
03:55:18.950 --> 03:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
contribution is not imposed as a
 
03:55:22.189 --> 03:55:22.199 align:start position:0%
separate tax line right right on the tax
 
03:55:25.670 --> 03:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
bill it would be part of the local
 
03:55:28.830 --> 03:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
education property tax approved by if I
 
03:55:31.189 --> 03:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
might at the time the budget is
 
03:55:35.110 --> 03:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
developed granted the Appropriations are
 
03:55:37.189 --> 03:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
well they're a recommendation and let's
 
03:55:39.229 --> 03:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
leave aside the revenues their estimates
 
03:55:40.830 --> 03:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
yeah but the Appropriations that's
 
03:55:43.630 --> 03:55:43.640 align:start position:0%
what's key here is the district is meant
 
03:55:46.670 --> 03:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
to appr riate at least a minimum but
 
03:55:49.710 --> 03:55:49.720 align:start position:0%
you're also suggesting that that minimum
 
03:55:52.630 --> 03:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
be a certain percentage of the total
 
03:55:55.389 --> 03:55:55.399 align:start position:0%
either in and of itself as a district or
 
03:55:59.550 --> 03:55:59.560 align:start position:0%
Rel relative to a Statewide goal so it's
 
03:56:01.510 --> 03:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
possible because you know the
 
03:56:03.349 --> 03:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
appropriation amount as you develop the
 
03:56:05.630 --> 03:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
budget again are we looking at it
 
03:56:07.910 --> 03:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
prevote because the voters can change
 
03:56:10.269 --> 03:56:10.279 align:start position:0%
things but if it's it's development of
 
03:56:12.910 --> 03:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
the budget the budget is developed you
 
03:56:12.920 --> 03:56:14.710 align:start position:0%
the budget the budget is developed you
have

03:56:14.710 --> 03:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:56:18.630 --> 03:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
an ability to to look at those uh
 
03:56:21.110 --> 03:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
respective percentages Appropriations
 
03:56:24.269 --> 03:56:24.279 align:start position:0%
are a million swept is
 
03:56:26.950 --> 03:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
x foundation
 
03:56:31.469 --> 03:56:31.479 align:start position:0%
Opportunity Grant is the is it the new
 
03:56:34.910 --> 03:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
adequacy Aid it would so you know that
 
03:56:38.990 --> 03:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
and then you the net is the local amount
 
03:56:41.670 --> 03:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
you now have a common ability to Common
 
03:56:44.469 --> 03:56:44.479 align:start position:0%
sizee it before the budget is Tak
 
03:56:47.469 --> 03:56:47.479 align:start position:0%
forward so if it's out of line alignment
 
03:56:48.870 --> 03:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
but that would be the Local District
 
03:56:51.349 --> 03:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
would have to know that oh the way we've
 
03:56:52.710 --> 03:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
built the
 
03:56:56.630 --> 03:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
budget with swept being what it is the
 
03:56:59.429 --> 03:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
foundation being what it is the local
 
03:57:01.790 --> 03:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
taxes or contribution would be what it
 
03:57:04.750 --> 03:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
would be based on the Appropriations you
 
03:57:08.030 --> 03:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
have the math it doesn't line up in the
 
03:57:10.990 --> 03:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
sense reiterate the budget because it
 
03:57:14.189 --> 03:57:14.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be meeting again it's not a Dr
 
03:57:17.670 --> 03:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
check sure we so so maybe maybe we're
 
03:57:20.349 --> 03:57:20.359 align:start position:0%
not um you
 
03:57:22.750 --> 03:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
know maybe we're we're we're still not
 
03:57:25.110 --> 03:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
on the same page on this let me try to
 
03:57:28.229 --> 03:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
illustrate it through an example so um
 
03:57:31.269 --> 03:57:31.279 align:start position:0%
let's say that Hopkins Foundation
 
03:57:31.279 --> 03:57:32.870 align:start position:0%
let's say that Hopkins Foundation
opportunity

03:57:32.870 --> 03:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
03:57:36.149 --> 03:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
budget as
 
03:57:40.229 --> 03:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
calculated on page four mhm comes out at
 
03:57:40.239 --> 03:57:42.070 align:start position:0%
calculated on page four mhm comes out at
$20

03:57:42.070 --> 03:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
$20
 
03:57:44.830 --> 03:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
million and let's say
 
03:57:49.110 --> 03:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
hopkinson's valuation is is a billion
 
03:57:52.950 --> 03:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
dollars property valuation and let's say
 
03:57:56.590 --> 03:57:56.600 align:start position:0%
the the local minimum contribution is $3
 
03:58:00.630 --> 03:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
per thousand so Hopkinson would raise $3
 
03:58:05.030 --> 03:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:08.429 --> 03:58:08.439 align:start position:0%
contribution that would be a subtracted
 
03:58:10.309 --> 03:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
from the $20
 
03:58:13.590 --> 03:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
million Foundation opportunity budget
 
03:58:15.189 --> 03:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
and it would result in a grant to
 
03:58:18.429 --> 03:58:18.439 align:start position:0%
Hopkinson of $17 million
 
03:58:21.710 --> 03:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
MH nothing has gone through Dr yet yeah
 
03:58:23.910 --> 03:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
so the state has to pay up 17 million
 
03:58:25.750 --> 03:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
the the the the state Grant to
 
03:58:28.309 --> 03:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
hopkington would be $17 million and and
 
03:58:30.510 --> 03:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
and Hopkinton is that goes through all
 
03:58:31.910 --> 03:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
the school board and the budget
 
03:58:33.630 --> 03:58:33.640 align:start position:0%
committee and the and the district
 
03:58:36.349 --> 03:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
meeting I see and the the the at the
 
03:58:39.750 --> 03:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
district meeting there they um the um
 
03:58:41.389 --> 03:58:41.399 align:start position:0%
the voters you know the school board
 
03:58:44.790 --> 03:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
presents a budget of you know $2.2
 
03:58:48.910 --> 03:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
million right and and when when when
 
03:58:51.710 --> 03:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
looking at the revenues the the 17
 
03:58:54.429 --> 03:58:54.439 align:start position:0%
million coming from the state the what
 
03:58:56.710 --> 03:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
and what coming from different sources
 
03:58:59.630 --> 03:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
hopkins's going to have to raise another
 
03:59:03.070 --> 03:59:03.080 align:start position:0%
another you know say say $4 million and
 
03:59:06.630 --> 03:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
it will do that through a local um
 
03:59:08.790 --> 03:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
education property tax and that's where
 
03:59:11.429 --> 03:59:11.439 align:start position:0%
the Dr becomes involved okay at that
 
03:59:15.790 --> 03:59:15.800 align:start position:0%
stage um we don't have anything to do at
 
03:59:18.429 --> 03:59:18.439 align:start position:0%
that State this is a pre vote the
 
03:59:19.990 --> 03:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
budget's been developed correct in
 
03:59:22.550 --> 03:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
accordance with all that meets every bit
 
03:59:24.830 --> 03:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
of the law it meets the intent of the
 
03:59:27.349 --> 03:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
law it's going out for vote it might get
 
03:59:29.990 --> 03:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
amended up or down or sideways and so
 
03:59:32.630 --> 03:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
forth uh yearend fund balance from a
 
03:59:35.349 --> 03:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
school districts alter things some but
 
03:59:35.359 --> 03:59:37.510 align:start position:0%
school districts alter things some but
that's

03:59:37.510 --> 03:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:59:39.910 --> 03:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
normal I think we'd be calculating a
 
03:59:42.030 --> 03:59:42.040 align:start position:0%
local school rate just as we always
 
03:59:44.750 --> 03:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
would yeah and just as if and I know
 
03:59:47.990 --> 03:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
this is Mak complex simple for my
 
03:59:50.710 --> 03:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
sake Foundation all of the work of
 
03:59:53.469 --> 03:59:53.479 align:start position:0%
developing the foundation opportunity
 
03:59:56.950 --> 03:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
cost and the grant is all in the
 
04:00:00.349 --> 04:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
background to Dr just as adequacy Aid is
 
04:00:03.590 --> 04:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
we need a number for a district how it's
 
04:00:05.830 --> 04:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
developed is not the black box but it
 
04:00:07.910 --> 04:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
could be to us we just need education to
 
04:00:09.750 --> 04:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
tell us what it is for Hopkin School
 
04:00:12.229 --> 04:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
District that's what it sounds like here
 
04:00:14.870 --> 04:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy if you're an agreement
 
04:00:17.229 --> 04:00:17.239 align:start position:0%
that we don't have particular roles in
 
04:00:19.830 --> 04:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
the midst and especially if we don't
 
04:00:22.510 --> 04:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with trying to
 
04:00:25.710 --> 04:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
calculate a tax rate before we calculate
 
04:00:28.510 --> 04:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
the tax rate and and just if that's then
 
04:00:30.630 --> 04:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
I'm really happy in the scenario you
 
04:00:33.550 --> 04:00:33.560 align:start position:0%
described that's easy peasy the scenario
 
04:00:34.870 --> 04:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
where that scenario could get I don't
 
04:00:37.070 --> 04:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
know if there's a if the if the intent
 
04:00:38.389 --> 04:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
is to do something else what if
 
04:00:40.389 --> 04:00:40.399 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton only raised $2 million in
 
04:00:42.750 --> 04:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
local tax effort what would happen in
 
04:00:46.269 --> 04:00:46.279 align:start position:0%
that situation that's and so in in
 
04:00:49.429 --> 04:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
earlier versions of this draft um if
 
04:00:52.710 --> 04:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
Hopkinson only raised 2/3 of what its
 
04:00:56.309 --> 04:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
local minimum contribution um was then
 
04:00:58.189 --> 04:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
uh we we contemplated dick you'll
 
04:01:00.309 --> 04:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
remember we talked about this um
 
04:01:03.110 --> 04:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
reducing the the the foundation
 
04:01:03.120 --> 04:01:04.349 align:start position:0%
reducing the the the foundation
Opportunity

04:01:04.349 --> 04:01:04.359 align:start position:0%
Opportunity
 
04:01:08.950 --> 04:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
Grant by that same percentage
 
04:01:12.630 --> 04:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
and we took that we took that penalty
 
04:01:14.469 --> 04:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
out because
 
04:01:16.590 --> 04:01:16.600 align:start position:0%
we didn't feel that that taking money
 
04:01:19.229 --> 04:01:19.239 align:start position:0%
away from schools would be the right
 
04:01:24.229 --> 04:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
thing to do um but if if it's an
 
04:01:27.830 --> 04:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
incentive if it's a if it's a stick yeah
 
04:01:30.790 --> 04:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
to to require the local school district
 
04:01:33.790 --> 04:01:33.800 align:start position:0%
to raise the appropriate local minimum
 
04:01:35.149 --> 04:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
then it could go back in we have the
 
04:01:37.590 --> 04:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
Lang that Happ if a District's uh
 
04:01:40.070 --> 04:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
approved a cap which is substantially
 
04:01:44.830 --> 04:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
lower tax cap tax cap I I uh I don't
 
04:01:46.469 --> 04:01:46.479 align:start position:0%
think it would be substantially lower in
 
04:01:48.830 --> 04:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
these cases I mean we've seen it happen
 
04:01:51.189 --> 04:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
no no no but no but they they you know
 
04:01:52.950 --> 04:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
given how we're funding it right now
 
04:01:57.670 --> 04:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah um but not not in these not I
 
04:02:00.950 --> 04:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
mean so the $5 per th000 or $3 per
 
04:02:02.750 --> 04:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
thousand is more a measurement than it
 
04:02:05.269 --> 04:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
is actually interacting with the tax
 
04:02:07.990 --> 04:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
system right it's it's it's an it's it's
 
04:02:11.269 --> 04:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
a way for the Department to to to
 
04:02:13.910 --> 04:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
calculate the grant based on the
 
04:02:16.750 --> 04:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
Foundation opportunity budget okay and
 
04:02:20.710 --> 04:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
um and obviously everything works best
 
04:02:22.790 --> 04:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
when when when that school district is
 
04:02:25.110 --> 04:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
funded just like Bill was saying through
 
04:02:27.910 --> 04:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
that integrated approach involving local
 
04:02:30.630 --> 04:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
and state that partnership between local
 
04:02:33.670 --> 04:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
and state if if the local is going to
 
04:02:36.149 --> 04:02:36.159 align:start position:0%
disregard its portion of that and say oh
 
04:02:37.510 --> 04:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
the grant we're getting from the state
 
04:02:39.990 --> 04:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
is enough then that's not a good that's
 
04:02:44.070 --> 04:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:47.790 --> 04:02:47.800 align:start position:0%
question it is a partnership repres now
 
04:02:49.309 --> 04:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I just got thrown off
 
04:02:50.630 --> 04:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
track but
 
04:02:54.630 --> 04:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
um the whether it's $5 $3 or wherever it
 
04:02:58.269 --> 04:02:58.279 align:start position:0%
gets set it's characterized as a quote
 
04:03:00.790 --> 04:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
minimum Foundation budget
 
04:03:03.229 --> 04:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
contribution right so I mean the
 
04:03:06.269 --> 04:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
question that I heard Mark rais is what
 
04:03:09.110 --> 04:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
happens if the municipality raises less
 
04:03:11.670 --> 04:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
but it's a minimum they're obligated to
 
04:03:15.269 --> 04:03:15.279 align:start position:0%
raise that much if it was n a minimum it
 
04:03:19.510 --> 04:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
would become another form of the issue
 
04:03:23.309 --> 04:03:23.319 align:start position:0%
we currently have with swept where uh
 
04:03:27.750 --> 04:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
the use of excess swept is to you know
 
04:03:31.910 --> 04:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
offset other obligations right so so I
 
04:03:34.870 --> 04:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
think I I like this the way I'm reading
 
04:03:37.910 --> 04:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
it in the bill which is it's a minimum
 
04:03:40.469 --> 04:03:40.479 align:start position:0%
it's an obligation and the state only
 
04:03:42.229 --> 04:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
makes up the difference to the extent
 
04:03:44.710 --> 04:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
that the difference is needed
 
04:03:46.510 --> 04:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
well that's good to the extent that it's
 
04:03:50.309 --> 04:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
needed yes 20 million you talk it's only
 
04:03:50.319 --> 04:03:51.950 align:start position:0%
needed yes 20 million you talk it's only
17

04:03:51.950 --> 04:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
17
 
04:03:54.550 --> 04:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
million that the state portion you said
 
04:03:57.349 --> 04:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
3 million would be paid by the local and
 
04:04:02.149 --> 04:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
17 million by the state correct or 20
 
04:04:04.349 --> 04:04:04.359 align:start position:0%
yeah 17 million what happen if the
 
04:04:08.630 --> 04:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
district uh appropr needs 15 million not
 
04:04:11.269 --> 04:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
70 I'm sorry I missed that that they
 
04:04:14.429 --> 04:04:14.439 align:start position:0%
that they raised more money than the Min
 
04:04:17.389 --> 04:04:17.399 align:start position:0%
than the minimum they only require 15
 
04:04:19.510 --> 04:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
million instead of that instead of the
 
04:04:19.520 --> 04:04:20.950 align:start position:0%
million instead of that instead of the
17

04:04:20.950 --> 04:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
17
 
04:04:24.110 --> 04:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
million they rais more they rais more so
 
04:04:26.349 --> 04:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
they have excess
 
04:04:30.349 --> 04:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
yeah um this is essentially a reciprocal
 
04:04:31.990 --> 04:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
of the same outcome we're currently
 
04:04:37.590 --> 04:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:41.429 --> 04:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
um so so let's let's so you know we're
 
04:04:44.389 --> 04:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
sticking with Hopkinson for example um
 
04:04:44.399 --> 04:04:45.510 align:start position:0%
sticking with Hopkinson for example um
the

04:04:45.510 --> 04:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:04:48.790 --> 04:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
the the foundation opportunity budget
 
04:04:52.110 --> 04:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
for a town like Hopkinson would would
 
04:04:54.110 --> 04:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
very likely be substantially less than
 
04:04:56.429 --> 04:04:56.439 align:start position:0%
we're currently paying for you know for
 
04:04:59.349 --> 04:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
our education and when we calculated at
 
04:05:01.670 --> 04:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
three years ago I think hopkington had
 
04:05:03.790 --> 04:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
maybe a $20 million budget and the
 
04:05:05.429 --> 04:05:05.439 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget was like
 
04:05:08.070 --> 04:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
16 million so it's doubtful that
 
04:05:10.389 --> 04:05:10.399 align:start position:0%
Hopkinson would be satisfied with just
 
04:05:14.269 --> 04:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
the $16 million budget let alone even go
 
04:05:17.630 --> 04:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
lower than that now for the city of
 
04:05:20.870 --> 04:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester the foundation oper operating
 
04:05:22.309 --> 04:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget would be
 
04:05:22.319 --> 04:05:23.910 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget would be
substantially

04:05:23.910 --> 04:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
substantially
 
04:05:26.950 --> 04:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
higher and and could it be that that the
 
04:05:29.110 --> 04:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester says you know what
 
04:05:30.870 --> 04:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
we're good with the foundation
 
04:05:32.590 --> 04:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
Opportunity Grant and we're not going to
 
04:05:36.269 --> 04:05:36.279 align:start position:0%
put a dime uh towards this well we did
 
04:05:38.149 --> 04:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
have an early a provision in an earlier
 
04:05:40.830 --> 04:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
draft of this that if you don't
 
04:05:44.389 --> 04:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
contribute um your 100% share
 
04:05:47.110 --> 04:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
of your minimum local contribution then
 
04:05:49.189 --> 04:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
your foundation Opportunity Grant gets
 
04:05:52.030 --> 04:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
red pro-rated by that same amount so if
 
04:05:54.710 --> 04:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
Manchester came in at zero then you
 
04:05:56.349 --> 04:05:56.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't get a foundation Opportunity
 
04:06:00.110 --> 04:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:03.830 --> 04:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
um would would yeah then you'd have zero
 
04:06:05.990 --> 04:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
budget yeah
 
04:06:10.309 --> 04:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
um so so would would it make sense to
 
04:06:14.429 --> 04:06:14.439 align:start position:0%
have that stick back in here to so that
 
04:06:16.630 --> 04:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
if if uh if a district says well you
 
04:06:19.870 --> 04:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
know what um I like the found Manchester
 
04:06:21.950 --> 04:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
I like the found Foundation opportunity
 
04:06:24.510 --> 04:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
budget but I really only need 90% of it
 
04:06:26.670 --> 04:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
so I'm only going to put in 90% of the
 
04:06:31.630 --> 04:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:35.630 --> 04:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:38.189 --> 04:06:38.199 align:start position:0%
option well I'm just saying the the
 
04:06:40.670 --> 04:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
other options Mary where is that they
 
04:06:43.990 --> 04:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
put in zero and they get all of the
 
04:06:48.670 --> 04:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
Grant or they
 
04:06:50.670 --> 04:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
um but no I don't think that's I don't
 
04:06:51.710 --> 04:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
think that's going to happen because I
 
04:06:52.790 --> 04:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
think the yeah I don't think it's gonna
 
04:06:54.030 --> 04:06:54.040 align:start position:0%
Happ well well no I don't think they're
 
04:06:56.110 --> 04:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that in the bill where the
 
04:06:59.389 --> 04:06:59.399 align:start position:0%
if the $5 is a measurement then then I'm
 
04:07:02.229 --> 04:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
not going to if they decide to say well
 
04:07:04.790 --> 04:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
I would like more money so my local
 
04:07:07.389 --> 04:07:07.399 align:start position:0%
minimum is zero so give me more money
 
04:07:09.189 --> 04:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
that's I don't no no no no no that's not
 
04:07:11.030 --> 04:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying that's what I'm saying
 
04:07:13.710 --> 04:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
if if if Manchester was satisfied with
 
04:07:16.189 --> 04:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
the grant yeah as as being with the
 
04:07:18.030 --> 04:07:18.040 align:start position:0%
assumption that they're their budget
 
04:07:19.030 --> 04:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
yeah with the Assumption they're putting
 
04:07:21.790 --> 04:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
a contribution in yeah it the the the
 
04:07:25.429 --> 04:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
grants calculated based on based on
 
04:07:28.309 --> 04:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
their their local minimum
 
04:07:30.550 --> 04:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
contribution if they decide not to put
 
04:07:31.710 --> 04:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
the local minimum and this is a good
 
04:07:33.750 --> 04:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
thing to test if they don't want to put
 
04:07:35.590 --> 04:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
the if they don't put the local minimum
 
04:07:37.630 --> 04:07:37.640 align:start position:0%
contribution in there should they get
 
04:07:39.149 --> 04:07:39.159 align:start position:0%
the grant at
 
04:07:43.030 --> 04:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
all and I think that's a that's a policy
 
04:07:45.590 --> 04:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's so that would uh that's a policy
 
04:07:46.910 --> 04:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
decision of course and that would not
 
04:07:48.229 --> 04:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
create any
 
04:07:50.990 --> 04:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
um mechanical issues or technical issues
 
04:07:52.189 --> 04:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
whether you went one way or the other
 
04:07:54.870 --> 04:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
with that um the other potential again
 
04:07:55.950 --> 04:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
this is we know how this is going to
 
04:07:57.910 --> 04:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
work for 90% of school districts or we
 
04:07:59.910 --> 04:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
have an idea we can hypothesize how it
 
04:08:01.710 --> 04:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
work for most school districts would
 
04:08:03.149 --> 04:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
there ever what would
 
04:08:05.109 --> 04:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
um I guess now we're getting to the
 
04:08:05.990 --> 04:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
mechanic I think we just kind of
 
04:08:07.670 --> 04:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
discussed it what what mechanically
 
04:08:11.189 --> 04:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
happen if your um State Grant was 17
 
04:08:14.910 --> 04:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
million and you only wanted to have a
 
04:08:19.510 --> 04:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
total budget of 15 million that's where
 
04:08:22.149 --> 04:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
I don't if that's another again unlikely
 
04:08:24.070 --> 04:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
to happen well I mean there there's a
 
04:08:26.109 --> 04:08:26.119 align:start position:0%
couple ways you could do that if if the
 
04:08:28.389 --> 04:08:28.399 align:start position:0%
grant was 17 million and you only want a
 
04:08:32.149 --> 04:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
budget of 15 million then then ra then
 
04:08:34.070 --> 04:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
rather than putting 3 million in as the
 
04:08:36.269 --> 04:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
local contribution and having a budget
 
04:08:41.149 --> 04:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
of 20 million then maybe you
 
04:08:43.429 --> 04:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
put maybe you have a local contribution
 
04:08:46.070 --> 04:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
tion of 2 million and your your Grant
 
04:08:48.630 --> 04:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
gets reduced by or 2 and A5 million your
 
04:08:50.550 --> 04:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
Grant gets reduced by a similar amount
 
04:08:52.870 --> 04:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
and you get to 15 million I mean that
 
04:08:55.349 --> 04:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
could be calculated by the local school
 
04:08:59.790 --> 04:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
district um but but that would require a
 
04:08:59.800 --> 04:09:00.590 align:start position:0%
district um but but that would require a
a

04:09:00.590 --> 04:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:09:04.269 --> 04:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
pration um provision in here and that's
 
04:09:08.149 --> 04:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
a policy discussion policy consideration
 
04:09:11.790 --> 04:09:11.800 align:start position:0%
that that that we would have to have you
 
04:09:14.750 --> 04:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
know is that is that good for kids is
 
04:09:17.349 --> 04:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
that good for I mean what you know what
 
04:09:19.750 --> 04:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
do we want to do and I like I said my
 
04:09:21.790 --> 04:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
original the original draft I put
 
04:09:24.550 --> 04:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
together on this prior to even before
 
04:09:27.349 --> 04:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
filing because like we pulled it out of
 
04:09:31.950 --> 04:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
1680 had that Pro rating um U provision
 
04:09:33.710 --> 04:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
in there
 
04:09:36.630 --> 04:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
so I could certainly put it back in the
 
04:09:37.950 --> 04:09:37.960 align:start position:0%
way it would play out actually I think
 
04:09:39.269 --> 04:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
the way it would play out is say your
 
04:09:41.030 --> 04:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
state Grant was 17 million you only
 
04:09:44.109 --> 04:09:44.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to budget 15 million um you would
 
04:09:46.550 --> 04:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
have you
 
04:09:49.349 --> 04:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
would uh you would want to just build up
 
04:09:51.109 --> 04:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
a trust fund or something you would not
 
04:09:53.269 --> 04:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
I mean ideally you just wouldn't cut
 
04:09:53.279 --> 04:09:54.229 align:start position:0%
I mean ideally you just wouldn't cut
your

04:09:54.229 --> 04:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:09:56.070 --> 04:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
budget you would spend the foundation
 
04:09:58.269 --> 04:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget essentially I think
 
04:09:59.469 --> 04:09:59.479 align:start position:0%
that's how it
 
04:10:02.030 --> 04:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
would use kind of like I mean I think
 
04:10:03.429 --> 04:10:03.439 align:start position:0%
you probably would but the question is
 
04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
should you get it at all if you don't
 
04:10:07.109 --> 04:10:07.119 align:start position:0%
put anything you don't try to if you
 
04:10:11.149 --> 04:10:11.159 align:start position:0%
don't if if you if
 
04:10:13.990 --> 04:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
you yeah if you ignore that very first
 
04:10:17.309 --> 04:10:17.319 align:start position:0%
part um was this like a maintenance of
 
04:10:19.950 --> 04:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
effort yeah yeah I think that's the way
 
04:10:21.750 --> 04:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
to think of it I I I actually think
 
04:10:23.550 --> 04:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
we're getting uh I actually don't think
 
04:10:25.950 --> 04:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
this is mechanically a thing that's
 
04:10:28.229 --> 04:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
gonna happen so so what what do you want
 
04:10:31.030 --> 04:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
to do oh no I was just going down I I
 
04:10:32.030 --> 04:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
don't think there's a I don't think
 
04:10:33.309 --> 04:10:33.319 align:start position:0%
there's a technical issue here because I
 
04:10:35.710 --> 04:10:35.720 align:start position:0%
think you would you would just build a
 
04:10:37.030 --> 04:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
school that has that provides a
 
04:10:39.349 --> 04:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget so but I
 
04:10:40.750 --> 04:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
just went down that R sorry went down
 
04:10:42.429 --> 04:10:42.439 align:start position:0%
that rabbit hole I I don't know if
 
04:10:42.439 --> 04:10:47.590 align:start position:0%
that rabbit hole I I don't know if
there's

04:10:47.590 --> 04:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:52.349 --> 04:10:52.359 align:start position:0%
G names yeah I think this is um related
 
04:10:55.349 --> 04:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
um I believe Massachusetts has a
 
04:10:58.950 --> 04:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
provision that enables a school district
 
04:11:03.109 --> 04:11:03.119 align:start position:0%
to come forward and engage in a dialogue
 
04:11:04.389 --> 04:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:11:09.750 --> 04:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
state if it believes it it um
 
04:11:12.469 --> 04:11:12.479 align:start position:0%
can get the outcomes we're talking of
 
04:11:12.479 --> 04:11:15.750 align:start position:0%
can get the outcomes we're talking of
outcomes

04:11:15.750 --> 04:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:19.590 --> 04:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
and spend a lower amount than the
 
04:11:22.910 --> 04:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
foundation budget has identified as
 
04:11:25.710 --> 04:11:25.720 align:start position:0%
needed so there's a process that they
 
04:11:28.550 --> 04:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
have in Massachusetts to
 
04:11:31.710 --> 04:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
reduce below what the formula says the
 
04:11:36.389 --> 04:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
outcome the budget should be and um and
 
04:11:38.550 --> 04:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
then there's agreement on that and life
 
04:11:40.109 --> 04:11:40.119 align:start position:0%
goes forward and everybody's happy
 
04:11:43.950 --> 04:11:43.960 align:start position:0%
because you know uh good outcomes and uh
 
04:11:43.960 --> 04:11:45.349 align:start position:0%
because you know uh good outcomes and uh
spending

04:11:45.349 --> 04:11:45.359 align:start position:0%
spending
 
04:11:48.269 --> 04:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
less so that maybe we need to take a
 
04:11:49.870 --> 04:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
look at that
 
04:11:55.149 --> 04:11:55.159 align:start position:0%
M okay sure so if we were to do that
 
04:11:57.070 --> 04:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
would we have to do some kind of a
 
04:11:59.950 --> 04:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
demonstration first that demonstrates
 
04:12:02.790 --> 04:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
that your children are achieving to that
 
04:12:05.990 --> 04:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
level with this amount of money so that
 
04:12:08.750 --> 04:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
you've got evidence yeah I think that's
 
04:12:11.070 --> 04:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
part of the Massachusetts process that's
 
04:12:16.349 --> 04:12:16.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:18.870 --> 04:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
do do you know do they have that in
 
04:12:18.880 --> 04:12:21.389 align:start position:0%
do do you know do they have that in
Statue

04:12:21.389 --> 04:12:21.399 align:start position:0%
Statue
 
04:12:23.910 --> 04:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
okay but I think getting back to the
 
04:12:26.790 --> 04:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
other point who was mentioned um there's
 
04:12:28.349 --> 04:12:28.359 align:start position:0%
no problem to raise more than the
 
04:12:31.830 --> 04:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
minimum either that's
 
04:12:35.510 --> 04:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:38.429 --> 04:12:38.439 align:start position:0%
important now while we're talking about
 
04:12:41.590 --> 04:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
that since you brought that up Glen
 
04:12:43.870 --> 04:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
um there
 
04:12:46.429 --> 04:12:46.439 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know if Massachusetts has
 
04:12:53.109 --> 04:12:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:53.119 --> 04:12:55.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:12:55.630 --> 04:12:55.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:01.189 --> 04:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:04.830 --> 04:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
sorry the psea fed's kicking
 
04:13:08.710 --> 04:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
in watch out that stuff gives you a
 
04:13:11.309 --> 04:13:11.319 align:start position:0%
what's that that stuff gives you a it's
 
04:13:14.109 --> 04:13:14.119 align:start position:0%
bad it's bad yeah the the other the
 
04:13:17.630 --> 04:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
other thing I wanted to discuss was uh
 
04:13:20.429 --> 04:13:20.439 align:start position:0%
some of the sped data uh chairman lad
 
04:13:21.950 --> 04:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
that you were interested in looking at
 
04:13:24.269 --> 04:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
and we discussed it earlier the weights
 
04:13:27.429 --> 04:13:27.439 align:start position:0%
um so actually um I have some data on
 
04:13:29.309 --> 04:13:29.319 align:start position:0%
high cost bed
 
04:13:32.429 --> 04:13:32.439 align:start position:0%
students the student the invoices they
 
04:13:35.109 --> 04:13:35.119 align:start position:0%
submitted the state to get sped Aid
 
04:13:37.830 --> 04:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
which means their sped cost are higher
 
04:13:40.389 --> 04:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
than uh this is from 2021 their sped
 
04:13:43.389 --> 04:13:43.399 align:start position:0%
costs were higher than 59,000 y and that
 
04:13:44.990 --> 04:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
student the invoices they sent to the
 
04:13:48.030 --> 04:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
state and their disability so that is
 
04:13:51.429 --> 04:13:51.439 align:start position:0%
the uh data I have relative to high cost
 
04:13:54.309 --> 04:13:54.319 align:start position:0%
bed students related to disabilities um
 
04:13:56.750 --> 04:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
I think you all of you were discussing
 
04:13:58.870 --> 04:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
earlier can I get more granular than
 
04:13:59.950 --> 04:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
that with the
 
04:14:03.469 --> 04:14:03.479 align:start position:0%
doe2 no I have sped cost by District
 
04:14:05.550 --> 04:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
broken up by Elementary Middle High
 
04:14:08.950 --> 04:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
School I have some um functions or
 
04:14:14.510 --> 04:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
objects object codes within sped data um
 
04:14:17.429 --> 04:14:17.439 align:start position:0%
um but I can't get too granular with
 
04:14:19.670 --> 04:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
do25 SP what we were trying to do we
 
04:14:22.229 --> 04:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
were looking at in that report that you
 
04:14:25.109 --> 04:14:25.119 align:start position:0%
know the commission report we were
 
04:14:28.429 --> 04:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
looking at awaited uh calculation based
 
04:14:28.439 --> 04:14:30.389 align:start position:0%
looking at awaited uh calculation based
upon

04:14:30.389 --> 04:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
upon
 
04:14:34.269 --> 04:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
4.29 yep what we're what we're
 
04:14:36.590 --> 04:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting is what we worked on last
 
04:14:38.910 --> 04:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
year in that legislation that we passed
 
04:14:41.229 --> 04:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
out of the house education committee
 
04:14:44.630 --> 04:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
here where there'd be category ories uh
 
04:14:46.710 --> 04:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
and we suggested three
 
04:14:50.030 --> 04:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
categories and breaking those uh high
 
04:14:50.040 --> 04:14:51.389 align:start position:0%
categories and breaking those uh high
cost

04:14:51.389 --> 04:14:51.399 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:14:54.830 --> 04:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
IEPs into a a different weighted
 
04:14:57.469 --> 04:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
category than one where a student is
 
04:14:59.990 --> 04:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
spending less than so many hours per
 
04:15:03.550 --> 04:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
week or less than 80% of their time
 
04:15:06.429 --> 04:15:06.439 align:start position:0%
within and I thought and represent
 
04:15:08.309 --> 04:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
cascaden correct me if I'm wrong but I
 
04:15:13.070 --> 04:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
thought under under idea Part B there's
 
04:15:16.349 --> 04:15:16.359 align:start position:0%
requirement to submit this information
 
04:15:19.469 --> 04:15:19.479 align:start position:0%
to State
 
04:15:23.109 --> 04:15:23.119 align:start position:0%
sped so don't you have this data we have
 
04:15:25.469 --> 04:15:25.479 align:start position:0%
sped I mean you've seen the data we have
 
04:15:28.309 --> 04:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
sped data on disability type I I I
 
04:15:29.550 --> 04:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
recognize and I've gotten that and
 
04:15:31.830 --> 04:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
you've had that for years the number in
 
04:15:33.790 --> 04:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
each IEP
 
04:15:37.030 --> 04:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
category um but you're saying
 
04:15:40.070 --> 04:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
expenditures Ida
 
04:15:43.630 --> 04:15:43.640 align:start position:0%
expenditures no that's the the full-time
 
04:15:46.389 --> 04:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
that you have within the the the each
 
04:15:46.399 --> 04:15:47.590 align:start position:0%
that you have within the the the each
category

04:15:47.590 --> 04:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
category
 
04:15:51.630 --> 04:15:51.640 align:start position:0%
area um it doesn't talk about costs at
 
04:15:54.910 --> 04:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
all so what we're looking for is there
 
04:15:57.750 --> 04:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
are there any costs an average cost for
 
04:15:59.710 --> 04:15:59.720 align:start position:0%
example like for a kid the kids that are
 
04:16:03.590 --> 04:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
in that category a category B and
 
04:16:06.630 --> 04:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
category C which is the residential
 
04:16:09.070 --> 04:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
placements which I think you told me
 
04:16:10.950 --> 04:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
there are close what to 700 kids there
 
04:16:14.229 --> 04:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
in that category yep so we're just
 
04:16:16.389 --> 04:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
trying to get the data so we recognize
 
04:16:19.830 --> 04:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
that many states many states are are are
 
04:16:21.950 --> 04:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
waiting this out by
 
04:16:24.550 --> 04:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
categories um we'd like we' like to
 
04:16:27.510 --> 04:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
contemplate doing the same thing so how
 
04:16:29.229 --> 04:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
do we get that data you actually yeah so
 
04:16:30.229 --> 04:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
you brought up a point I didn't think
 
04:16:32.630 --> 04:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
about so the doe2 is really rolled up
 
04:16:35.389 --> 04:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
not a lot of granularity there um the
 
04:16:38.870 --> 04:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
sped aid program we have a a lot of data
 
04:16:41.590 --> 04:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
on high cost fed students I didn't even
 
04:16:45.030 --> 04:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
think about at the idea within this is
 
04:16:46.630 --> 04:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
not my program we'd have to bring in
 
04:16:48.870 --> 04:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
Becky for that um but if that's
 
04:16:50.510 --> 04:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
something basically it sounds like what
 
04:16:52.389 --> 04:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
you're looking for
 
04:16:56.070 --> 04:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
is each sped student served in the not
 
04:16:57.830 --> 04:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
not every school district every well
 
04:16:59.269 --> 04:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
most school districts have sped cost not
 
04:17:02.389 --> 04:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
every of them access their Ida or or or
 
04:17:05.189 --> 04:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
they have different Ida programs um but
 
04:17:08.189 --> 04:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
if we just took the sort of raw Ida data
 
04:17:10.469 --> 04:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
we might be able to answer that question
 
04:17:13.550 --> 04:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
average cost per disability type
 
04:17:16.269 --> 04:17:16.279 align:start position:0%
if if that data is entered into the
 
04:17:17.550 --> 04:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
special ed
 
04:17:21.189 --> 04:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
database not every District participate
 
04:17:23.790 --> 04:17:23.800 align:start position:0%
in use of that database yeah it's not
 
04:17:27.189 --> 04:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
it's not perfect and also I there SP I'm
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
sure there's there's I know there's a
 
04:17:29.710 --> 04:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
bunch of SP expenditure is not covered
 
04:17:31.469 --> 04:17:31.479 align:start position:0%
by Ida so I don't even know how
 
04:17:32.990 --> 04:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive it would be it would be
 
04:17:35.429 --> 04:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
qualified um just like the high cost fed
 
04:17:36.590 --> 04:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
student data is qualified it only
 
04:17:38.590 --> 04:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
includes 700 students instead of the
 
04:17:40.830 --> 04:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
30,000 that we
 
04:17:45.349 --> 04:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:45.359 --> 04:17:47.469 align:start position:0%
 
system

04:17:47.469 --> 04:17:47.479 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh dis so by cost or I'm not aware of
 
04:17:58.990 --> 04:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
now on this fact sheet from the feds
 
04:18:02.389 --> 04:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
M it says children with IEPs age five
 
04:18:05.510 --> 04:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
who are enrolled in kindergarten uh and
 
04:18:08.670 --> 04:18:08.680 align:start position:0%
age six through age 21 served and then
 
04:18:10.550 --> 04:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
has these indicator these
 
04:18:14.550 --> 04:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
areas uh indicator 58 inside riger class
 
04:18:17.309 --> 04:18:17.319 align:start position:0%
80% or more of the
 
04:18:21.590 --> 04:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
day indicator 5B inside riger class less
 
04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
than 40% of the day in indicator C in
 
04:18:27.790 --> 04:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
separate schools residential facilities
 
04:18:30.590 --> 04:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
or homebound Hospital type
 
04:18:33.550 --> 04:18:33.560 align:start position:0%
programming uh so that's the stuff we're
 
04:18:35.429 --> 04:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
trying to get a hold
 
04:18:35.439 --> 04:18:37.510 align:start position:0%
trying to get a hold
of

04:18:37.510 --> 04:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:18:40.710 --> 04:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
so yeah as far as getting
 
04:18:44.510 --> 04:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
really good data and making we it's not
 
04:18:46.630 --> 04:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
going to just not going to happen good
 
04:18:49.469 --> 04:18:49.479 align:start position:0%
data relative to speding cost um but if
 
04:18:51.790 --> 04:18:51.800 align:start position:0%
you're looking for a ballpark figure or
 
04:18:55.030 --> 04:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
a model or assumpt a really heavily
 
04:18:59.030 --> 04:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
assumed prediction um we could try
 
04:19:01.309 --> 04:19:01.319 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
um basically I think what you were
 
04:19:07.189 --> 04:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
discussing two years ago and also uh
 
04:19:10.670 --> 04:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday that 4.2 weight is somehow
 
04:19:13.870 --> 04:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
dividing that up and saying putting sped
 
04:19:17.349 --> 04:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
students into categories and so getting
 
04:19:20.030 --> 04:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
to the totality of that 4.28 but if
 
04:19:21.630 --> 04:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
there's a student with a lowc cost
 
04:19:23.550 --> 04:19:23.560 align:start position:0%
disability in one District they're fully
 
04:19:25.229 --> 04:19:25.239 align:start position:0%
they're compensated at a lesser rate
 
04:19:28.510 --> 04:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
than if a student has a high cost so
 
04:19:31.149 --> 04:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we have a lot of different
 
04:19:32.710 --> 04:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
ways to attempt to get that data we have
 
04:19:34.229 --> 04:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
about you know till February 15th to
 
04:19:36.469 --> 04:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
figure it out
 
04:19:38.750 --> 04:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
um I just don't know what path you think
 
04:19:41.389 --> 04:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
we should pursue represent cascaden I
 
04:19:43.590 --> 04:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
just wondered um
 
04:19:45.630 --> 04:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
sped directors put in a lot of this
 
04:19:48.309 --> 04:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
detailed data in the Nessa system and
 
04:19:50.229 --> 04:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if it's worth having Jane
 
04:19:54.269 --> 04:19:54.279 align:start position:0%
berson come up um if she knows in
 
04:19:57.389 --> 04:19:57.399 align:start position:0%
advance what we're looking for and Becky
 
04:20:00.309 --> 04:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
and Becky for Deb yeah can I ask a
 
04:20:04.469 --> 04:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
question about the doe2 yes in the doe2
 
04:20:06.950 --> 04:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
is there a line that just says special
 
04:20:11.510 --> 04:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
ed costs so um uh we have um it's
 
04:20:14.429 --> 04:20:14.439 align:start position:0%
program 1200 which includes like special
 
04:20:18.309 --> 04:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
programs um that's uh pretty reli that's
 
04:20:21.950 --> 04:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
well that's more reliable than the sped
 
04:20:23.510 --> 04:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
breakdown data then we have a sped
 
04:20:25.030 --> 04:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
breakdown data that breaks down sped
 
04:20:27.670 --> 04:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
instruction sped support sped legal sped
 
04:20:30.189 --> 04:20:30.199 align:start position:0%
Administration so we do have data so we
 
04:20:33.109 --> 04:20:33.119 align:start position:0%
we there's an approximate aggregate cost
 
04:20:35.189 --> 04:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
I think it's almost a billion dollars
 
04:20:38.469 --> 04:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
yep like 700 District 700 so would it be
 
04:20:42.109 --> 04:20:42.119 align:start position:0%
feasible if we using those lines from
 
04:20:46.990 --> 04:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
the do 25 if we were to determine that
 
04:20:49.189 --> 04:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
um the state of New Hampshire is going
 
04:20:54.349 --> 04:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
to buy uh cover 50% or 75% of all sped
 
04:20:57.070 --> 04:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
costs for school
 
04:21:00.189 --> 04:21:00.199 align:start position:0%
district um to me that would be kind of
 
04:21:03.910 --> 04:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
a clean easy way I've noticed that a lot
 
04:21:06.269 --> 04:21:06.279 align:start position:0%
of school districts a lot of states are
 
04:21:09.149 --> 04:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
doing those kinds of things um instead
 
04:21:12.950 --> 04:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
of trying to um do District by District
 
04:21:16.389 --> 04:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
if we could just take that amount by
 
04:21:19.670 --> 04:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
district and do a
 
04:21:24.830 --> 04:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
percentage so we have um we have the
 
04:21:26.830 --> 04:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
total sped spend as reported by the
 
04:21:26.840 --> 04:21:28.349 align:start position:0%
total sped spend as reported by the
districts

04:21:28.349 --> 04:21:28.359 align:start position:0%
districts
 
04:21:30.830 --> 04:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
y um so we can do whatever you want with
 
04:21:34.309 --> 04:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
that data um what
 
04:21:37.309 --> 04:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
um it's possible if we legislate it and
 
04:21:39.550 --> 04:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
fund it you could you could you could
 
04:21:41.469 --> 04:21:41.479 align:start position:0%
write that bill with the data we have
 
04:21:43.510 --> 04:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:21:47.070 --> 04:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
but then you're not getting any um
 
04:21:49.750 --> 04:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
differentiated cost per student based on
 
04:21:52.590 --> 04:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
disability what what yeah what the yeah
 
04:21:55.590 --> 04:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
what you know we we uh looked at this
 
04:21:59.750 --> 04:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
and initially I set it up by the 13 IEP
 
04:22:01.349 --> 04:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
or disability
 
04:22:04.070 --> 04:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
areas but then recognizing after talking
 
04:22:07.269 --> 04:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
to directors in the field any one of
 
04:22:07.279 --> 04:22:08.229 align:start position:0%
to directors in the field any one of
those

04:22:08.229 --> 04:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:22:11.309 --> 04:22:11.319 align:start position:0%
categories could involve a lot more time
 
04:22:14.790 --> 04:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
spent I and delivering that service a
 
04:22:16.389 --> 04:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
speech pathologist could be working with
 
04:22:21.149 --> 04:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
a young person every day for you know an
 
04:22:24.750 --> 04:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
hour a day maybe or it could be only uh
 
04:22:27.229 --> 04:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
a a younger child in a group of five
 
04:22:29.950 --> 04:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
learning how to say the letter r in
 
04:22:32.070 --> 04:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
kindergarten which is not kindergarten
 
04:22:33.630 --> 04:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
but maybe first grade or so and you have
 
04:22:36.990 --> 04:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
five in the group for two a half hours a
 
04:22:40.109 --> 04:22:40.119 align:start position:0%
week but but the issue I see here with
 
04:22:43.510 --> 04:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
this funding all special ed
 
04:22:45.309 --> 04:22:45.319 align:start position:0%
$27,000 a
 
04:22:48.510 --> 04:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
kid that's opening up this thing to
 
04:22:50.990 --> 04:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
abuse uh you know man as a
 
04:22:52.389 --> 04:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
superintendent of schools I could say
 
04:22:54.830 --> 04:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
wow I know how I can latch into somebody
 
04:22:57.990 --> 04:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
we're just going to put more IEPs down
 
04:23:01.349 --> 04:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
or we're going to monitor more kids so
 
04:23:04.309 --> 04:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
and and so I think there's I'd like to
 
04:23:07.389 --> 04:23:07.399 align:start position:0%
see us if we can if we can now doing the
 
04:23:09.710 --> 04:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
cat Aid part or the special Aid we know
 
04:23:11.790 --> 04:23:11.800 align:start position:0%
that we got that information that's a
 
04:23:11.800 --> 04:23:13.070 align:start position:0%
that we got that information that's a
given

04:23:13.070 --> 04:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
given
 
04:23:15.670 --> 04:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
but on in terms of the other two
 
04:23:17.670 --> 04:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
categories or whatever categories we're
 
04:23:20.109 --> 04:23:20.119 align:start position:0%
have I think we need to work with Becky
 
04:23:22.149 --> 04:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
fet and we need to look with the
 
04:23:24.870 --> 04:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
directors and Jan berser on and and try
 
04:23:27.389 --> 04:23:27.399 align:start position:0%
to nail this thing down I think it can
 
04:23:32.070 --> 04:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
be done uh when I initially did this I
 
04:23:34.950 --> 04:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
did it by IEP I found out that's not
 
04:23:36.830 --> 04:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to make it it's got to
 
04:23:40.590 --> 04:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
be done by time spent with the adult but
 
04:23:42.429 --> 04:23:42.439 align:start position:0%
Rick you have to remember too the kids
 
04:23:45.229 --> 04:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
kids have more than one disability get a
 
04:23:47.950 --> 04:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
primary disability so and but some are
 
04:23:51.030 --> 04:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
getting have multiple disabilities the
 
04:23:53.510 --> 04:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
other can I just raise one more issue we
 
04:23:57.189 --> 04:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
have uh Federal Law requires school
 
04:24:00.349 --> 04:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
districts to serve kiddos three through
 
04:24:03.950 --> 04:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
five now do we look at that at all in
 
04:24:07.389 --> 04:24:07.399 align:start position:0%
terms of we don't there preschool
 
04:24:10.109 --> 04:24:10.119 align:start position:0%
special ed money but that doesn't cover
 
04:24:11.870 --> 04:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
all the costs that a school district
 
04:24:11.880 --> 04:24:12.870 align:start position:0%
all the costs that a school district
incurs

04:24:12.870 --> 04:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
incurs
 
04:24:15.149 --> 04:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
most school districts run an integrated
 
04:24:18.790 --> 04:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
preschool um how do we do we offer any
 
04:24:27.550 --> 04:24:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:30.590 --> 04:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
question I was waiting for Mark to say
 
04:24:32.269 --> 04:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
whether he's dealing with that how how
 
04:24:34.670 --> 04:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
are you is that money now currently
 
04:24:37.750 --> 04:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
coming from HHS for grades three three
 
04:24:40.269 --> 04:24:40.279 align:start position:0%
through five there's a prek Ida Grant I
 
04:24:41.349 --> 04:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
don't have the numbers off top of my
 
04:24:43.750 --> 04:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
head our cost our 780 million and I
 
04:24:44.950 --> 04:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
would have to break it down by I don't
 
04:24:46.830 --> 04:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
have a prek breakdown but I have an
 
04:24:50.510 --> 04:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
elementary uh breakdown um but as we all
 
04:24:52.870 --> 04:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
know um Federal money and state money
 
04:24:54.469 --> 04:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
does not even come close to covering all
 
04:24:57.870 --> 04:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
sped costs so I mean that's that's well
 
04:25:01.550 --> 04:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
lastly though we know the IEP
 
04:25:03.910 --> 04:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
stipulates the number of contacts and
 
04:25:05.630 --> 04:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
the length of the contacts within the
 
04:25:08.269 --> 04:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
IEP that information is out it may be
 
04:25:10.469 --> 04:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
out there on those I APS and may be held
 
04:25:12.670 --> 04:25:12.680 align:start position:0%
within the districts
 
04:25:14.790 --> 04:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
however I I think we should be able to
 
04:25:17.309 --> 04:25:17.319 align:start position:0%
grab it and get a hold of it
 
04:25:20.149 --> 04:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
somehow the amount of service provided
 
04:25:22.870 --> 04:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
the amount of time service provided
 
04:25:26.070 --> 04:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
exactly it could be so much for the the
 
04:25:28.349 --> 04:25:28.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal therapist is in there the
 
04:25:29.950 --> 04:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
occupational therapists is in there with
 
04:25:32.070 --> 04:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
the child the the uh learning
 
04:25:34.229 --> 04:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
disabilities they're all there add them
 
04:25:35.830 --> 04:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
all up that's the amount and that's in
 
04:25:37.790 --> 04:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
the IP the amount of service
 
04:25:37.800 --> 04:25:40.070 align:start position:0%
the IP the amount of service
provided

04:25:40.070 --> 04:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
provided
 
04:25:42.670 --> 04:25:42.680 align:start position:0%
and it it's it it's it's going to be
 
04:25:44.830 --> 04:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
something new but it's something that I
 
04:25:48.630 --> 04:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
think is relevant for us to know too so
 
04:25:50.990 --> 04:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
the only thing I would say is um talking
 
04:25:53.670 --> 04:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
about novel aspects of the bill and this
 
04:25:55.109 --> 04:25:55.119 align:start position:0%
concept is novel in a sense we've we've
 
04:25:56.670 --> 04:25:56.680 align:start position:0%
kind of been studying for a little bit
 
04:25:58.870 --> 04:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
um but we've haven't done it dug too
 
04:26:00.630 --> 04:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
deep uh you've been studying it for
 
04:26:03.590 --> 04:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
years I would ask uh I recommend that
 
04:26:05.830 --> 04:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
you bring in us this our SP Bureau in
 
04:26:07.750 --> 04:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
right away because they're going to tell
 
04:26:09.990 --> 04:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
you where the where the dead ends are um
 
04:26:12.269 --> 04:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
we talked about that just earlier but
 
04:26:15.550 --> 04:26:15.560 align:start position:0%
you know I'm concerned back in 2010 when
 
04:26:17.710 --> 04:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
I first gotten this joint here back in
 
04:26:21.309 --> 04:26:21.319 align:start position:0%
2008 our Statewide population was what
 
04:26:25.349 --> 04:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh 210,000 kids
 
04:26:28.469 --> 04:26:28.479 align:start position:0%
maybe okay and then and now where are we
 
04:26:31.710 --> 04:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
down in terms of residents 165 164
 
04:26:34.510 --> 04:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere in that neighborhood 155 admr
 
04:26:36.070 --> 04:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
number of kids that were in special back
 
04:26:38.070 --> 04:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
when I came in
 
04:26:41.550 --> 04:26:41.560 align:start position:0%
30,000 the number today 30,000 that's
 
04:26:44.309 --> 04:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
right so proportionately that ratio is
 
04:26:45.990 --> 04:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
going you know we're having more kids in
 
04:26:47.630 --> 04:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
this program this is a program which
 
04:26:50.349 --> 04:26:50.359 align:start position:0%
seems to be growing in our state or
 
04:26:52.469 --> 04:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
we're identifying better than we have in
 
04:26:55.630 --> 04:26:55.640 align:start position:0%
the past which I think we are and we're
 
04:26:58.070 --> 04:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
getting earlier into this game I I think
 
04:27:00.269 --> 04:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
we need to get this information to me
 
04:27:02.550 --> 04:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
this is a critical factor for any
 
04:27:04.349 --> 04:27:04.359 align:start position:0%
formula we have whether it's outcome
 
04:27:06.429 --> 04:27:06.439 align:start position:0%
based or if it's input based we need to
 
04:27:09.070 --> 04:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
have this in our
 
04:27:11.429 --> 04:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
formula the only other things uh just as
 
04:27:13.309 --> 04:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
far as scheduling in the the work you
 
04:27:15.229 --> 04:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
want to try to um accomplish in the next
 
04:27:18.030 --> 04:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
couple weeks yeah getting the SP buau in
 
04:27:21.510 --> 04:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
to see what data is available and then
 
04:27:23.630 --> 04:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're interested in
 
04:27:25.830 --> 04:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
1586 seeing what we can do with that
 
04:27:29.109 --> 04:27:29.119 align:start position:0%
data um you'd want to start to come up
 
04:27:30.510 --> 04:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
with the methodology right away so then
 
04:27:31.870 --> 04:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
we can get the data pull so then we
 
04:27:33.070 --> 04:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
could pull it into the put it into the
 
04:27:35.550 --> 04:27:35.560 align:start position:0%
formula is Rebecca in the grand State
 
04:27:38.389 --> 04:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
Building yep good I'll be there tomorrow
 
04:27:40.189 --> 04:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
and and I have a meeting over there
 
04:27:42.429 --> 04:27:42.439 align:start position:0%
dealing with another topic but uh if I
 
04:27:43.830 --> 04:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
could arrange the time to meet with
 
04:27:46.070 --> 04:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
Rebecca and try and get this thing going
 
04:27:48.710 --> 04:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
a little bit um it would certainly be
 
04:27:51.910 --> 04:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
appreciated and and relative to 1586 um
 
04:27:53.670 --> 04:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
if you want to talk about accountability
 
04:27:56.870 --> 04:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
bring in Dr Green um that's Nate bring
 
04:28:00.070 --> 04:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
in K bring in the whole crew but so
 
04:28:02.349 --> 04:28:02.359 align:start position:0%
that's that's the only I can I can work
 
04:28:03.870 --> 04:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
with representative luno and and and
 
04:28:05.870 --> 04:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
tune up that spreadsheet um to have that
 
04:28:08.389 --> 04:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
for you but um great just there's a lot
 
04:28:10.149 --> 04:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
of other work there you're going going
 
04:28:12.630 --> 04:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
down so yeah
 
04:28:15.750 --> 04:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
okay do we have any other issues with
 
04:28:19.910 --> 04:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
Dr or with doe on this right
 
04:28:22.750 --> 04:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
now what we plan on doing right after
 
04:28:24.630 --> 04:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
and right now is what we wanted to do is
 
04:28:26.469 --> 04:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
that we were going to where are we going
 
04:28:29.469 --> 04:28:29.479 align:start position:0%
now um leaving today what kind of
 
04:28:32.510 --> 04:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
research are we looking to acquire and
 
04:28:34.830 --> 04:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
move towards and and because we have an
 
04:28:36.229 --> 04:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity here we have a few days
 
04:28:39.269 --> 04:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
where we can have a research who has now
 
04:28:42.590 --> 04:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
disappeared uh do some work for us or
 
04:28:45.830 --> 04:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
or or ask doe to help us search out or
 
04:28:48.550 --> 04:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
in fact if if we need anything from Dr
 
04:28:52.590 --> 04:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
um so from the committee um anything yes
 
04:28:55.670 --> 04:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
do we need to I know um uh Andrew
 
04:29:00.309 --> 04:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
valinsky had spoken about the um Title
 
04:29:04.830 --> 04:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
One proog Esa which covers um a lot of
 
04:29:08.309 --> 04:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
kids across the state and the um schools
 
04:29:10.109 --> 04:29:10.119 align:start position:0%
in need of improvement that the names
 
04:29:12.630 --> 04:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
have changed since do we need to have
 
04:29:15.469 --> 04:29:15.479 align:start position:0%
somebody update us on those kinds of
 
04:29:17.550 --> 04:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
things in terms of the work that they're
 
04:29:20.389 --> 04:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
doing and how they identify schools um
 
04:29:22.510 --> 04:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
is that something we need to know about
 
04:29:23.710 --> 04:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
CSI schools that's part of the
 
04:29:25.389 --> 04:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
accountability program the federally
 
04:29:29.349 --> 04:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
mandated or regulated accountability
 
04:29:32.790 --> 04:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
program so that would be um uh Dr Green
 
04:29:35.149 --> 04:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
and his
 
04:29:38.710 --> 04:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
employees so would that play into
 
04:29:42.070 --> 04:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
1586 I'm not sure well I think in the
 
04:29:45.830 --> 04:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
accountability on the accountability end
 
04:29:48.830 --> 04:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
would um you know we there's there two
 
04:29:56.510 --> 04:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:56.520 --> 04:29:58.870 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:29:58.870 --> 04:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:30:02.750 --> 04:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
CSS and what happens as a result of that
 
04:30:04.950 --> 04:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
what kind of support do they get or not
 
04:30:10.189 --> 04:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:13.149 --> 04:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
know it's Title One
 
04:30:18.630 --> 04:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
money yeah okay um so we can ask for
 
04:30:21.990 --> 04:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
that information um in regard to the
 
04:30:26.070 --> 04:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
other bills on on Swap on in regard to
 
04:30:31.229 --> 04:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
uh uh the base cost and do we need uh
 
04:30:33.149 --> 04:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
more information on anybody come in or
 
04:30:34.830 --> 04:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
anything additional for the special ed
 
04:30:39.630 --> 04:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:43.510 --> 04:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
bills um chairman yeah I have a question
 
04:30:47.830 --> 04:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
I originally saw um the sweat belt by
 
04:30:51.269 --> 04:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
itself because it addressed the court
 
04:30:51.279 --> 04:30:52.870 align:start position:0%
itself because it addressed the court
summary

04:30:52.870 --> 04:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
summary
 
04:30:55.149 --> 04:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
judgment in
 
04:30:57.109 --> 04:30:57.119 align:start position:0%
1686 or
 
04:30:59.309 --> 04:30:59.319 align:start position:0%
1586 I can't remember which one which
 
04:31:01.429 --> 04:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
one have we've been talking about
 
04:31:04.630 --> 04:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
1586 all right a dress is
 
04:31:08.950 --> 04:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
swept so do we break out sweat and
 
04:31:11.070 --> 04:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
continue to move all the components we
 
04:31:15.990 --> 04:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
want in that 16 in that sweat Bill and
 
04:31:19.830 --> 04:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
take it out of this one so that we have
 
04:31:23.229 --> 04:31:23.239 align:start position:0%
a bill for swep and a bill for the
 
04:31:26.630 --> 04:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity grants the funding mechanism
 
04:31:32.429 --> 04:31:32.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:35.229 --> 04:31:35.239 align:start position:0%
together so
 
04:31:38.229 --> 04:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
there's it depends on how your funding
 
04:31:41.229 --> 04:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
formula is if we're if we're if we were
 
04:31:44.189 --> 04:31:44.199 align:start position:0%
to move forward forward with no funding
 
04:31:47.109 --> 04:31:47.119 align:start position:0%
formula changes and just swept reform
 
04:31:50.109 --> 04:31:50.119 align:start position:0%
than um than I think the provisions in
 
04:31:56.990 --> 04:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
um in 16 1686 1586 no 1586
 
04:32:02.710 --> 04:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
1686 um are um are correct uh uh I think
 
04:32:04.990 --> 04:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
we may want to
 
04:32:08.830 --> 04:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
consider possibly amending that to
 
04:32:12.070 --> 04:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
bect collected locally like like it's
 
04:32:15.550 --> 04:32:15.560 align:start position:0%
done now and send it all in yeah and
 
04:32:18.070 --> 04:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
then all the districts would get their
 
04:32:20.750 --> 04:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
adequacy Grant as a direct Grant from
 
04:32:22.950 --> 04:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
the state as opposed to collect some of
 
04:32:28.070 --> 04:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
it save some of it send the rest um up
 
04:32:31.630 --> 04:32:31.640 align:start position:0%
um that's one thing I suggest yeah I
 
04:32:33.750 --> 04:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
would say we need a discussion on that I
 
04:32:37.389 --> 04:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
think the uh the options are clear we
 
04:32:37.399 --> 04:32:39.429 align:start position:0%
think the uh the options are clear we
can

04:32:39.429 --> 04:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:32:45.149 --> 04:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
um take the uh dear 1686
 
04:32:47.950 --> 04:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
Bill and go forward with it as it is
 
04:32:51.030 --> 04:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
there's one option that's keeping uh
 
04:32:54.590 --> 04:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
sending only excess swept to the state
 
04:32:58.910 --> 04:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
and and coping with the uh relatively
 
04:33:02.870 --> 04:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
minor problems of uh of the negative tax
 
04:33:06.551 --> 04:33:06.561 align:start position:0%
rate or um there are some other issues
 
04:33:09.949 --> 04:33:09.959 align:start position:0%
excess sweat cost changing I I forget
 
04:33:12.310 --> 04:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
what they are but in any event uh um we
 
04:33:15.510 --> 04:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
can we can do it that way or we can do
 
04:33:20.189 --> 04:33:20.199 align:start position:0%
it the way it is in six
 
04:33:23.189 --> 04:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
1586 which takes all the money and sends
 
04:33:26.029 --> 04:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
it in except for a
 
04:33:30.910 --> 04:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
3% um amount to for process respect the
 
04:33:32.830 --> 04:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
fact that it cost municipalities some
 
04:33:36.949 --> 04:33:36.959 align:start position:0%
money to process this stuff um and um
 
04:33:39.349 --> 04:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
that also includes the uh free and
 
04:33:42.230 --> 04:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch uh
 
04:33:45.029 --> 04:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price homeowner rebate
 
04:33:47.109 --> 04:33:47.119 align:start position:0%
program low and moderate low and
 
04:33:49.429 --> 04:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
moderate I low and moderate same thing
 
04:33:52.189 --> 04:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
no it's not
 
04:33:55.670 --> 04:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah right sorry we can we can do it
 
04:33:57.670 --> 04:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
that way which is a more comprehensive
 
04:34:00.429 --> 04:34:00.439 align:start position:0%
approach more of a reform and that's the
 
04:34:02.310 --> 04:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
way it was originally proposed that's of
 
04:34:05.150 --> 04:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
course what I favor um I think there's
 
04:34:07.949 --> 04:34:07.959 align:start position:0%
some Merit to taking it out of uh the
 
04:34:10.990 --> 04:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
big Bill the foundation Bill and dealing
 
04:34:13.789 --> 04:34:13.799 align:start position:0%
with it separate Seely because who knows
 
04:34:15.349 --> 04:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen in the future and
 
04:34:18.189 --> 04:34:18.199 align:start position:0%
one may go all the way and one may not
 
04:34:22.750 --> 04:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
um and uh Rand uh the Rand case will
 
04:34:24.910 --> 04:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
probably be be resolved at least that
 
04:34:27.510 --> 04:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
part of the Rand Case by going ahead
 
04:34:31.629 --> 04:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
with with that particular bill so I I
 
04:34:33.029 --> 04:34:33.039 align:start position:0%
I'm recommending that we have a
 
04:34:34.830 --> 04:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
discussion on which way to go on these
 
04:34:37.230 --> 04:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
two we can talk about the pros and cons
 
04:34:39.910 --> 04:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
more completely I I I agree with you
 
04:34:41.789 --> 04:34:41.799 align:start position:0%
represent Ames I think we're going to
 
04:34:44.029 --> 04:34:44.039 align:start position:0%
need to have a separate time set aside
 
04:34:46.189 --> 04:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
for swept there are those that want to
 
04:34:48.551 --> 04:34:48.561 align:start position:0%
leave swept the way it is right
 
04:34:51.709 --> 04:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
now there are those that you would like
 
04:34:54.070 --> 04:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
to see swep handled the way that bill I
 
04:34:56.830 --> 04:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
handed out to you this morning where
 
04:34:58.269 --> 04:34:58.279 align:start position:0%
they can keep the access but they're
 
04:35:01.390 --> 04:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
required to use the excess monies for
 
04:35:03.670 --> 04:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
certain educational needs those are all
 
04:35:05.789 --> 04:35:05.799 align:start position:0%
things which could happen you know bills
 
04:35:06.670 --> 04:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
can be
 
04:35:10.070 --> 04:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
amended so so I think we uh we need to
 
04:35:14.029 --> 04:35:14.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:16.629 --> 04:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you well we're on the swept
 
04:35:19.390 --> 04:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
um because the amendment addresses the
 
04:35:21.109 --> 04:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
swept amount of
 
04:35:24.949 --> 04:35:24.959 align:start position:0%
334 million while I have Dr and doe here
 
04:35:26.670 --> 04:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
is there anybody
 
04:35:29.709 --> 04:35:29.719 align:start position:0%
who will we be able to talk about how
 
04:35:32.150 --> 04:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
that number was set and why it stays
 
04:35:34.709 --> 04:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
that amount in when we talk about the
 
04:35:36.510 --> 04:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
amendment or is this the time right now
 
04:35:38.510 --> 04:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
to talk about
 
04:35:42.789 --> 04:35:42.799 align:start position:0%
it have you seen this amendment
 
04:35:44.750 --> 04:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
so is the question how we got our swept
 
04:35:46.750 --> 04:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
number yeah that's one of them so it
 
04:35:50.869 --> 04:35:50.879 align:start position:0%
used to be a rate it used to be a rate
 
04:35:53.590 --> 04:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh then it became a flat dollar so the
 
04:35:56.029 --> 04:35:56.039 align:start position:0%
way swept works it's 363 million over
 
04:35:59.109 --> 04:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
whatever our non-utility tax Bas is so
 
04:36:01.789 --> 04:36:01.799 align:start position:0%
now it's a fixed dollar amount it used
 
04:36:09.750 --> 04:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:15.629 --> 04:36:15.639 align:start position:0%
$660 $66 6 C 60 cents per thousand in
 
04:36:19.629 --> 04:36:19.639 align:start position:0%
1999 and the legislature would lower
 
04:36:22.230 --> 04:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
that rate I believe almost every year
 
04:36:27.510 --> 04:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
for a number of years and then in
 
04:36:32.070 --> 04:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
2005 the legislature set it as a fixed
 
04:36:36.789 --> 04:36:36.799 align:start position:0%
dollar amount $363 million at least uh
 
04:36:39.709 --> 04:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
and it has been that since
 
04:36:42.310 --> 04:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
2005 we can only pip pothesized that
 
04:36:44.789 --> 04:36:44.799 align:start position:0%
that 363 number was similar to what they
 
04:36:47.470 --> 04:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
were currently doing or it was a Target
 
04:36:49.629 --> 04:36:49.639 align:start position:0%
they liked so by way I don't think we
 
04:36:51.750 --> 04:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
can tell or unless someone who's ever
 
04:36:55.029 --> 04:36:55.039 align:start position:0%
whoever was there uh 15 years ago or so
 
04:36:57.269 --> 04:36:57.279 align:start position:0%
by setting that rate that's in that
 
04:36:59.310 --> 04:36:59.320 align:start position:0%
soall I saw that for the first time this
 
04:37:01.150 --> 04:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
morning so I haven't had really time to
 
04:37:02.990 --> 04:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
think about it but by putting at that
 
04:37:06.869 --> 04:37:06.879 align:start position:0%
proposed rate lesser than the
 
04:37:11.029 --> 04:37:11.039 align:start position:0%
3063 would that eliminate excess that it
 
04:37:13.390 --> 04:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't eliminate it but it's it's
 
04:37:15.709 --> 04:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
$29 million which is the amount of
 
04:37:17.789 --> 04:37:17.799 align:start position:0%
excess swept less than what's being
 
04:37:20.750 --> 04:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
raised right now so but it wouldn't
 
04:37:22.670 --> 04:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
eliminate it wouldn't eliminate future
 
04:37:24.709 --> 04:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
ex okay so I switch to say yeah yeah
 
04:37:26.789 --> 04:37:26.799 align:start position:0%
yeah we have
 
04:37:31.269 --> 04:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
to um because it's in statute that we
 
04:37:33.830 --> 04:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
have to raise a certain amount of
 
04:37:39.070 --> 04:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
money isn't it true that the excess swep
 
04:37:42.310 --> 04:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
towns keep their money and other towns
 
04:37:45.070 --> 04:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
have to make up the difference to get to
 
04:37:47.789 --> 04:37:47.799 align:start position:0%
that legislated
 
04:37:47.799 --> 04:37:49.830 align:start position:0%
that legislated
amount

04:37:49.830 --> 04:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
amount
 
04:37:54.230 --> 04:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
no Bruce how do we how do we chew it up
 
04:37:56.109 --> 04:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
here's how it works uh sometime toward
 
04:37:58.590 --> 04:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
the end of each May the equalization
 
04:38:00.949 --> 04:38:00.959 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Department of Revenue finishes
 
04:38:03.590 --> 04:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
equalizing the property values of every
 
04:38:05.949 --> 04:38:05.959 align:start position:0%
municipality at that point they hand off
 
04:38:08.990 --> 04:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
that list to the municipal Bureau and
 
04:38:11.029 --> 04:38:11.039 align:start position:0%
then we just follow the dictates of the
 
04:38:13.910 --> 04:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
existing law uh with the legislature
 
04:38:16.150 --> 04:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
allows us to you to round to the nearest
 
04:38:18.429 --> 04:38:18.439 align:start position:0%
Half Penny which is why you see on that
 
04:38:20.750 --> 04:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
summary sheet sometimes the State
 
04:38:25.590 --> 04:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
education uh tax rate is uh $1
 
04:38:27.551 --> 04:38:27.561 align:start position:0%
45.5 if you
 
04:38:31.590 --> 04:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
will and then um having determined that
 
04:38:35.070 --> 04:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
that one rate will when applied against
 
04:38:37.510 --> 04:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
the equalized values create at least
 
04:38:41.510 --> 04:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
$363 million we then use the equalized
 
04:38:43.510 --> 04:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
property values of all 259
 
04:38:45.830 --> 04:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities and and basically create
 
04:38:49.109 --> 04:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
a common sizing or a percentage basis
 
04:38:50.670 --> 04:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
and then go back and take those
 
04:38:54.629 --> 04:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
percentages against the 363 thus giving
 
04:38:56.910 --> 04:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
uh one municipality whatever that dollar
 
04:39:01.470 --> 04:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
is that amount is then taxed locally
 
04:39:03.750 --> 04:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
using the locally assessed values of
 
04:39:06.789 --> 04:39:06.799 align:start position:0%
that property tax year thus giving rise
 
04:39:09.750 --> 04:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
to the annual question why isn't the
 
04:39:12.349 --> 04:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
swept rate in one community identical to
 
04:39:15.189 --> 04:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
the other because they won't be thank
 
04:39:18.590 --> 04:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome I've always wondered
 
04:39:18.600 --> 04:39:20.390 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome I've always wondered
that

04:39:20.390 --> 04:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:39:24.029 --> 04:39:24.039 align:start position:0%
okay so are there any other topics which
 
04:39:26.429 --> 04:39:26.439 align:start position:0%
we need to get information for when we
 
04:39:26.439 --> 04:39:28.390 align:start position:0%
we need to get information for when we
come

04:39:28.390 --> 04:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
come
 
04:39:28.400 --> 04:39:30.230 align:start position:0%
come
back

04:39:30.230 --> 04:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
back
 
04:39:32.310 --> 04:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
yes if
 
04:39:36.429 --> 04:39:36.439 align:start position:0%
1586 is moving forward at some point
 
04:39:38.788 --> 04:39:38.798 align:start position:0%
we're going to hit a total button and
 
04:39:40.628 --> 04:39:40.638 align:start position:0%
say Here's how much this is going to
 
04:39:40.638 --> 04:39:42.430 align:start position:0%
say Here's how much this is going to
cost

04:39:42.430 --> 04:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:39:43.990 --> 04:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
where's it coming
 
04:39:48.070 --> 04:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
from can we do it seems to me swept is
 
04:39:50.590 --> 04:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
the place it's going to come
 
04:39:54.708 --> 04:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
from I I can cover that uh
 
04:39:57.230 --> 04:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
so the scenarios I described to kind of
 
04:40:00.470 --> 04:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
just Target numbers um when you receive
 
04:40:04.150 --> 04:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
a town by town for that bill um I will
 
04:40:06.750 --> 04:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
show you what you're getting under
 
04:40:08.948 --> 04:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
current law and what you're getting
 
04:40:11.750 --> 04:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
under the proposed Bill and and so when
 
04:40:13.510 --> 04:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
I was talking about total spend I was
 
04:40:16.030 --> 04:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
talking about Statewide aggregate total
 
04:40:19.390 --> 04:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
so part of the way the mechanics of 1586
 
04:40:22.430 --> 04:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
works and some districts will um so
 
04:40:25.750 --> 04:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
everyone will be sending 97% of their
 
04:40:29.868 --> 04:40:29.878 align:start position:0%
swept to the state so um some
 
04:40:32.430 --> 04:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
communities with ex High excess swept
 
04:40:35.310 --> 04:40:35.320 align:start position:0%
will be sending a lot a lot of money to
 
04:40:38.150 --> 04:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
the state um then the way it works out
 
04:40:40.310 --> 04:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
with their Foundation opportunity budget
 
04:40:42.430 --> 04:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
if you have a large property tax base
 
04:40:45.070 --> 04:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
that $5 or $3 whatever the rate ends up
 
04:40:48.230 --> 04:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
being in the sort of final uh uh or when
 
04:40:51.350 --> 04:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
you see your spreadsheet um if it's $3
 
04:40:53.628 --> 04:40:53.638 align:start position:0%
that's going to for a community with a
 
04:40:56.110 --> 04:40:56.120 align:start position:0%
large tax base that might raise a lot of
 
04:40:58.628 --> 04:40:58.638 align:start position:0%
money meaning they sufficiently have a
 
04:41:00.708 --> 04:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
minimum contribution to have them meet
 
04:41:03.430 --> 04:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
their uh Foundation opportunity budget
 
04:41:04.990 --> 04:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
which means they would receive no State
 
04:41:06.788 --> 04:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
funding which
 
04:41:09.150 --> 04:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
means they're kind
 
04:41:13.550 --> 04:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
of neutral there but they just sent 97%
 
04:41:16.310 --> 04:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
of their swep to the state so there will
 
04:41:19.270 --> 04:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
be some communities where uh uh they'll
 
04:41:21.110 --> 04:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
be sending money to the state and
 
04:41:23.430 --> 04:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
receiving zero dollar so that's where
 
04:41:26.550 --> 04:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
some Revenue will be coming in um that's
 
04:41:29.430 --> 04:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
the way it's designed so uh uh but when
 
04:41:32.670 --> 04:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
I say net change total say so if I say
 
04:41:36.510 --> 04:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
$200 million net change total that under
 
04:41:37.868 --> 04:41:37.878 align:start position:0%
the the way I talk about that number
 
04:41:39.430 --> 04:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
that would need to find a revenue Source
 
04:41:42.628 --> 04:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
other than swept or or if you modify
 
04:41:46.110 --> 04:41:46.120 align:start position:0%
swept in some way but under the um it
 
04:41:47.270 --> 04:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
gets a little complicated but some of
 
04:41:48.868 --> 04:41:48.878 align:start position:0%
it's coming from essentially property
 
04:41:50.868 --> 04:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
taxes some of the funding is coming from
 
04:41:52.430 --> 04:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
property taxes it'll make more sense
 
04:41:54.788 --> 04:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
when you see a town by town but my my
 
04:41:58.070 --> 04:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
concern when this is finance yes is is
 
04:42:00.270 --> 04:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
we've got a Delta and we're going to
 
04:42:02.150 --> 04:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
have to come up with how we how do we
 
04:42:04.830 --> 04:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
fund the Delta it and and that's a good
 
04:42:07.788 --> 04:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
that's obviously a key part uh so if the
 
04:42:11.788 --> 04:42:11.798 align:start position:0%
net change total isga 8 million then
 
04:42:13.868 --> 04:42:13.878 align:start position:0%
Finance doesn't need to fund the Delta
 
04:42:15.110 --> 04:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
because it's actually saving the state
 
04:42:18.230 --> 04:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
$18 million um if the net change total
 
04:42:21.270 --> 04:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
is 200 million Finance well ways and
 
04:42:22.750 --> 04:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
wans of Finance need to work together
 
04:42:25.708 --> 04:42:25.718 align:start position:0%
and find 200 million
 
04:42:29.628 --> 04:42:29.638 align:start position:0%
so you'll see that in the spreadsheet um
 
04:42:31.868 --> 04:42:31.878 align:start position:0%
but yeah that's that's definitely a key
 
04:42:34.190 --> 04:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
key part of the conversation all right
 
04:42:36.990 --> 04:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
how much we have in rainy day fund the
 
04:42:38.670 --> 04:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
education trust fund is is looking
 
04:42:41.550 --> 04:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
really good um we have the budget in the
 
04:42:44.190 --> 04:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
audience um it's it's it's it's looking
 
04:42:46.110 --> 04:42:46.120 align:start position:0%
good the r fund's looking good but
 
04:42:48.470 --> 04:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
obviously well budget director will tell
 
04:42:49.590 --> 04:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
you how budgeting works you want to
 
04:42:52.590 --> 04:42:52.600 align:start position:0%
budget off revenues not off Surplus but
 
04:42:54.868 --> 04:42:54.878 align:start position:0%
um that's a whole other conversation
 
04:42:57.750 --> 04:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so we'll have swep on the next next
 
04:42:59.750 --> 04:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
meeting agenda as well can we just ask
 
04:43:02.150 --> 04:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
for a balance on the education trust do
 
04:43:06.110 --> 04:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
you have a balance oh so the the cfer
 
04:43:08.390 --> 04:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
just completed the caffer said I think
 
04:43:12.110 --> 04:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
161 million that's what I read 160 uh
 
04:43:13.708 --> 04:43:13.718 align:start position:0%
this is now Finance needs to get briefed
 
04:43:15.628 --> 04:43:15.638 align:start position:0%
on this but um we're over we're going to
 
04:43:18.990 --> 04:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
predict it over budget by 31 million in
 
04:43:22.628 --> 04:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
adequacy um or adequacy EFA
 
04:43:25.868 --> 04:43:25.878 align:start position:0%
Charters so um um but revenues are doing
 
04:43:28.510 --> 04:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
really well and in the Surplus statement
 
04:43:32.150 --> 04:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
all of you adopted um you were
 
04:43:35.590 --> 04:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
predicting the Surplus to grow so the
 
04:43:37.390 --> 04:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
Surplus is predicted to grow based on
 
04:43:39.830 --> 04:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
all the metric I have but um I can't
 
04:43:40.868 --> 04:43:40.878 align:start position:0%
really give you a number until we have
 
04:43:44.230 --> 04:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
the um act for completed um which shows
 
04:43:48.708 --> 04:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:51.470 --> 04:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
23 you have questions add you need some
 
04:43:55.070 --> 04:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
revenues yeah we need you I'm waiting
 
04:43:59.788 --> 04:43:59.798 align:start position:0%
for that total button to get hit so yeah
 
04:44:02.670 --> 04:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
okay well if if uh folks have some
 
04:44:04.670 --> 04:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
things they'd like to put on the agenda
 
04:44:07.350 --> 04:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
please you know send me an email and
 
04:44:09.510 --> 04:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
I'll make sure we talk to Jan and get
 
04:44:11.310 --> 04:44:11.320 align:start position:0%
that on on the docket for the next
 
04:44:14.628 --> 04:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
meeting on on the 19th at 10:00 down
 
04:44:16.190 --> 04:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
around the corner on the second floor
 
04:44:16.200 --> 04:44:17.510 align:start position:0%
around the corner on the second floor
209

04:44:17.510 --> 04:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
209
 
04:44:21.070 --> 04:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
209 so with that thank you very much for
 
04:44:23.830 --> 04:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
coming from the revenue folks and from
 
04:44:25.830 --> 04:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
the education folks appreciate
 
04:44:29.910 --> 04:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
it um Mr chair just a quick you know
 
04:44:32.350 --> 04:44:32.360 align:start position:0%
calendar question so we got six weeks
 
04:44:34.670 --> 04:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
before that February 15 are you thinking
 
04:44:36.430 --> 04:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
that we would spend at least a day a
 
04:44:40.510 --> 04:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
week or more than that or do you and and
 
04:44:43.310 --> 04:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
is the ultimate goal for the educ full
 
04:44:46.190 --> 04:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
education committee to accept something
 
04:44:48.150 --> 04:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
to bring to the floor is that where
 
04:44:50.510 --> 04:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
we're yeah the goal for this is that
 
04:44:52.590 --> 04:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
there be a recommendation come out of
 
04:44:55.150 --> 04:44:55.160 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee to the full committee
 
04:44:57.070 --> 04:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
and and you know the ones which will be
 
04:44:59.750 --> 04:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
voting on the recommendation will be
 
04:45:02.788 --> 04:45:02.798 align:start position:0%
only those that are on education policy
 
04:45:04.868 --> 04:45:04.878 align:start position:0%
that's the way this was set up however
 
04:45:06.670 --> 04:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
however we certainly encourage Ways and
 
04:45:09.230 --> 04:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
Means and finance to give us some good
 
04:45:11.788 --> 04:45:11.798 align:start position:0%
input here uh but we have to have a
 
04:45:14.150 --> 04:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation if it comes out like a 3
 
04:45:16.910 --> 04:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
three vote um it's probably going to
 
04:45:18.708 --> 04:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
come out of uh on the other side of the
 
04:45:20.750 --> 04:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
coin 2 1010 and then it's going to be
 
04:45:22.190 --> 04:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
you know another one of those debates in
 
04:45:24.590 --> 04:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
house FL we'll be back at square one
 
04:45:26.550 --> 04:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so what we got to do is really have
 
04:45:28.430 --> 04:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
to work hard and find out are there some
 
04:45:31.110 --> 04:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
things that we can do to you know uh
 
04:45:34.750 --> 04:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
move forward with
 
04:45:34.760 --> 04:45:39.150 align:start position:0%
move forward with
something

04:45:39.150 --> 04:45:39.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:43.948 --> 04:45:43.958 align:start position:0%
than no no no all all this all this is
