00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh but under current law to be able to
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
put this
 
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
this splint on somebody you need to be a
 
00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
licensed ems provider
 
00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
and many of my members are not licensed
 
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
ems providers some are
 
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh but many many are not and
 
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
this law will make it legal for them to
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
put this on
 
00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 align:start position:0%
uh they are all anybody that would
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
would do that would be trained
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
majority of our we we do about 30
 
00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
missions a year
 
00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
we can be three four five miles away
 
00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.070 align:start position:0%
we can be three four five miles away
from

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
the road and
 
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
it takes about 20 people to carry
 
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
somebody out that distance so the sooner
 
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
we can get that
 
00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 align:start position:0%
on the better fish and game conservation
 
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
officers are
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
are exempt from this
 
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
the license requirement
 
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
and this many times we are first on the
 
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.070 align:start position:0%
and this many times we are first on the
scene

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
scene
 
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.270 align:start position:0%
scene
typically

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
typically
 
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
you know at least 75 80 percent of the
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
rescuers are are volunteers uh from a
 
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
search and rescue team and this will
 
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
just correct
 
00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
i i think uh maybe an oversight that
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
will allow search and rescue members win
 
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh working on a on a mission activated
 
00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 align:start position:0%
by fish and game uh to provide
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
minimal uh
 
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
but would allow allow us to do that
 
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
without being in conflict with the ems
 
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.510 align:start position:0%
without being in conflict with the ems
law

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
chief any questions for the chief
 
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much chief
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
next up is colonel jordan
 
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
chief enforcement officer for fish and
 
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:30.150 align:start position:0%
chief enforcement officer for fish and
game

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:30.160 --> 00:08:38.709 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
that yeah that would be better should i
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh i apologize for that so this is uh
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
this has been a an issue in the past for
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
us so this law would just clean that up
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
and it would make it much easier for
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
them to do their job
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
i will tell you without the help of
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
these volunteer groups i think i've said
 
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
this many times here we wouldn't be
 
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
doing search and rescue and the pemi
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
team is is one of our number one teams
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
that helps us so
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
those carryouts would require every
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
officer i have in the state on duty to
 
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
cover so they would be nobody available
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
to do anything else so i want to any
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
chance we get to help these volunteer
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
groups uh is it's in our best interest
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
the state's best interest to do that
 
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
that's all i have thanks chief questions
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
for the chief
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative howard
 
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you for
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question is there a limit to
 
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
what medical
 
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
service they can provide
 
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
there is i think the the law states now
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
the current law starts talking about
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
invasive medical procedures so if you
 
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
were if you were conducting um you know
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
most of our emergency services are
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
that are done on a trail in wilderness
 
00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:54.389 align:start position:0%
that are done on a trail in wilderness
are

00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
splinting bandaging
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
those kinds of types of injuries and
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
you'd be okay to do that if we were to
 
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.150 align:start position:0%
you'd be okay to do that if we were to
start

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
start
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
providing medical treatment meds or
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
doing any kind of invasive surgery type
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
operations you couldn't do that and we
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do that on a trail anyway okay
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you yep
 
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the colonel
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
colonel so we're talking about um
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
so non-philanthropy i'm not going to say
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
non-certified some person might be
 
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
certified in first aid or other
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
provisions but non-licensed
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
people who would potentially providing
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
first aid type of services bandages that
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
kind of thing splints and and and some
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
license there would be some that are
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
licensed to do that but yes that would
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
be allowing the law requires them to be
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
licensed to do this in their townships
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
and and it doesn't expand to when folks
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
come down to into franconia if they
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
don't have a license for that so this
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
would allow them to do that
 
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
and does this i'm sorry follow-up so
 
00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
this and this would extend to
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
just also non-fire department that you
 
00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
might have a relationship with that are
 
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
that a search and rescue team so putting
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
my hat on as the civil air patrol
 
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
squadron commander right should they
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
have search and rescue teams that help
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
for downed aircraft and other reasons
 
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:09.519 align:start position:0%
that are also at the call of fish and
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
games so if they
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
if they were to go out and help you in a
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
search and they found it found the
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
subject and they could apply basic first
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
aid measures yes and without worrying
 
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
about liability yeah so that yeah so
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
just to clear up a little confused the
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
chief wears many hats behind me here
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
because he's a he's a
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
very dedicated public servant but most
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
of his pemmy team are not fire
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
departments they're they're
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
they're a variety of people a lot of
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
medical people uh some that are
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
non-medical um so yes that would be
 
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.069 align:start position:0%
non-medical um so yes that would be
correct

00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
harvey so um
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
at times do you use just members of the
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
public to help in searches and so forth
 
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
i do but we limit that
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh i call these my i refer to these
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
folks as my professional volunteers
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
that's really who i rely on i would not
 
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.949 align:start position:0%
that's really who i rely on i would not
ask

00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
ask
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
unless it was a dire emergency i would
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
not ask a common citizen to to perform
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
any kind of medical procedure i would
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
want one of these folks on board so
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
follow up please
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
so this would not include the those just
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
general members of the public that that
 
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
you have to use on a extremely i would
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
say no i would say that this would only
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
this would only apply to those search
 
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
and rescue team members okay thank you
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you sir
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
so anybody else would like to testify on
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
quick a quick straw poll um kind of
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
getting a sense of where we want to go
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
on the executive on this um
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
is there any but let me put it this way
 
00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
who would be in favor of ought to pass
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
as written and presented

one second because we don't have a clerk
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
i'm playing chairman clerk
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on
 
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
senate bill 260.
 
00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh just to make you aware we've had this
 
00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
bill before us i believe the colonel is
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
testified before in this bill
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
bill like it
 
00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:44.629 align:start position:0%
bill like it
and

00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
the problem wasn't the committee we
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
passed it like 20 i believe it was 21 to
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
nothing but when they got the finance
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
that's where we got into trouble and
 
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
that's where we shot down
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
so i just want to make you aware of that
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
well the good news this doesn't have an
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
fn on the end of it so i don't think
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%

first hearing do we need to be back for
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%

okay

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:23.749 align:start position:0%
 
what

00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:23.759 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
yeah just do uh
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
something real if you if you don't do it
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
i'll do it don't worry about it it's not
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:34.310 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
smith made the motion second motion
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
the bills from interim studies
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
well that's that's what i thought we
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
don't have to come back anymore okay
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
um i'll give you a heads up on on
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
you know what i'm thinking this is going
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
to go is uh
 
00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
i'm guessing on the search mark that
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
we're just going to not recommend
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
literally just put the rules in place
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
last month right
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
and i would agree with both of those um
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
search and rescue i just think we need
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
to talk about that not such a rescue
 
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.789 align:start position:0%
to talk about that not such a rescue
yeah

00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i think we'll be done i think the
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
you know colonel jordan's already agreed
 
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919 align:start position:0%
to work with anybody else in the future
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
that might want to clean up the existing
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
language which doesn't actually have
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the bill itself just
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
to do with that 207 language to a six
 
00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:40.310 align:start position:0%
to do with that 207 language to a six
language

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
he's free to do that on his own any
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
15 minutes each bill and we're done i
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
think we've all heard the public
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
just just so
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
presently smith 15 to zero
 
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
so we're going to call a work session of
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
the fish and game committee into order
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
we have two bills that we held over
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
for interim study
 
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
one bill is uh house bill 1091 relative
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
the search warrant for individuals
 
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
engaged in fish and game activities and
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
the second one was
 
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 1201 fn which was relative
 
01:01:55.829 --> 01:01:55.839 align:start position:0%
the bear damage
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna um
 
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
take up we'll take up first um
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 1091
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
and just to quick summarize at least my
 
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
version of the summary of what what we
 
01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
talked about on this bill and what we
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
heard in testimony was this was the
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
difference between the i was it 207 or
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
206 colonel jordan i was
 
01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
206. the 206 conservation officer
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
language and the full-blown peace
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
police powers language under 207 fish
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
and game officers can have a standard of
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable suspicion in order to do
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
certain searches whereas under the 594
 
01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:33.039 align:start position:0%
language sits full blown police officer
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
is its probable cause standard
 
01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:37.839 align:start position:0%
for searches
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
the testimony we heard was that there
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
have been three cases brought to the
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
supreme court all of which have been
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
found in favor of the reasonable
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
suspicion standard at this point
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
that being said colonel jordan did i'll
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
paraphrase what he said if he can get
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
his hands around the neck of the person
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
who wrote the 206 statute he'd be happy
 
01:02:56.079 --> 01:02:56.870 align:start position:0%
who wrote the 206 statute he'd be happy
to

01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
throttle them
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
and so he's willing to work with any
 
01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:01.039 align:start position:0%
member that might want to go forward
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
with language around that 207 to clean
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
up that the 206 statute to clean that up
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
but this bill isn't wasn't it um
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
remember we we deal with
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
what's actually the written words on the
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
page and not the concepts of things and
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
so the written words on this page were
 
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
not in such a way that we wanted to pass
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
it um i just in respect to colonel
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
jordan and that comment about working
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
with somebody on the 206 language i
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
wanted the interim study which i thought
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
was the appropriate motion so my
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
inclination on this bill again because
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
we deal with the words written on the
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
page and not the concepts is that
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
this should not be recommended for
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
future legislation but i'll open it up
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
for further discussion and if anybody
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
wants to ask colonel jordan questions or
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to testify in the
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
audience so why that might be a bad idea
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
happy to listen to it but is there any
 
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
further comment from the committee
 
01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
um on house bill 1091
 
01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
relative search warrants
 
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
representative harvey
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
um i i would be happy to take your
 
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation because um colonel jordan
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
is really the the expert and
 
01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
although there may be problems it does
 
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
seem like it's a problem that
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
if we try to very quickly in the next
 
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
you know 15 30 minutes to fix we could
 
01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
come up with something that's worse and
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
i think his offer to work with somebody
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
and come up with a better bill is a good
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
offer so i would be very much in favor
 
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
of your
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation of um not
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear our only committee
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations are either recommend it
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
for future legislation or not recommend
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
it for future legislation not to redraft
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
language or consider amendments or
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
anything else it's about the language
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's in the bill and whether we think
 
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
this bill should move forward for future
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
legislation for someone else to take a
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
look at it again
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
um so i just want to be clear on that
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be drafting any
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
language strictly whether or not the
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
current law the current bill is written
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
we recommend for future or not so just
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure we're clear on what the
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
motions are thank you
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
oregon go ahead
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
i believe this might have been heard
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
today one of the days i was substituting
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
and i was struck by the fact that um
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
second amendment group came out and
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
forced to testify against it but we
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
didn't get any input against it from the
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
actual sportsman communities it wasn't
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
anybody who was
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
actually engaged in
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
hunting or trapping or fishing that was
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to it which was sort of uh
 
01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
interesting some
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
um it was
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
probably another sign in my mind that uh
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
that it's best that it's like best not
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
to try to like best to wait till next
 
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
year to try to do anything with this
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
idea of that
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
okay colonel jordan did you want to add
 
01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
thank you any further comments from
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
representative close thank you mr
 
01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.950 align:start position:0%
representative close thank you mr
chairman

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
being a police officer and making many
 
01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:10.549 align:start position:0%
being a police officer and making many
arrests

01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
arrests
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
i've got a lot of search warrants i got
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
two of the biggest ones ever the state
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
ever had on probable cause
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
what we have here is
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
some of the old type
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
game ones that used to do certain things
 
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh going to bob houses and you know you
 
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
hear all kinds of stories about this and
 
01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.430 align:start position:0%
hear all kinds of stories about this and
that

01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
and it's not that way today today we
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
have a ceo that's well-educated
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh the ceos are well run they have
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
super very good supervisors i've seen a
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
lot of them i've dealt with a lot of
 
01:06:44.319 --> 01:06:45.910 align:start position:0%
lot of them i've dealt with a lot of
them

01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
i fish a lot i hunt a lot i'm everywhere
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
over the state
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
and i've been checked more than probably
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
30 40 times by ceos and everyone has
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
been polite everyone has been courteous
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
i have a bob house of cattle landing
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
they always knock on the door before
 
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
they come in
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
i've never had a problem with ceo
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
they've asked to come in
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
and what you want to do is be careful
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
because a lot of the
 
01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.309 align:start position:0%
because a lot of the
people

01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
especially the police officer i want to
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
get into your trunk
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
i'll be real nice and polite to you you
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
know would you let me look in there you
 
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
know then all of a sudden i find a pound
 
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
of marijuana in there then all things
 
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
have changed
 
01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
but when you
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
go and
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
start looking for search warrants you're
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
opening up a whole bucket of worms
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
if i have to get a search warrant i'll
 
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
guarantee you one thing you're going to
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
jail if i find something i'm going to
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
impound your car i'm going to take your
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
gun i'm going to take your fishing rod
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to take your boat
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
if i have to do all the typing and make
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
out all the reports with a warrant i'm
 
01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
gonna give it to you i'm gonna give you
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
your money's worth
 
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of times i stop here we go you get
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
a small bag of pot or something like
 
01:07:55.349 --> 01:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
that we log it we give you a chewing
 
01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
you're out you're gone our summons and
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
you're gone but if i have to dare to
 
01:07:59.599 --> 01:08:00.630 align:start position:0%
you're gone but if i have to dare to
warrant

01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you you're going to jail and
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
i'm taking everything with you
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
so i think when we have something like
 
01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
this bill in front of us we want to be
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
very very careful how we handle this
 
01:08:13.029 --> 01:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
because we're opening a bucket of worms
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
for the cos and for everybody else and i
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
just say
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
things have been going rather good at
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
fish and game right now and i don't
 
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
think we should be upsetting the whole
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
bandwagon over a couple stories about
 
01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
this one and that one and everything
 
01:08:26.239 --> 01:08:27.030 align:start position:0%
this one and that one and everything
else

01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
and i just think we've got to use a
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
little common sense here not get excited
 
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chairman
 
01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
so is that saying you you agree with the
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
not recommended for future legislation
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you
 
01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion with among the
 
01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.149 align:start position:0%
further discussion with among the
committee

01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
again i i do think some of this comes
 
01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
down i call it boogeyman legislation
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
right we're afraid of something we're
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
not sure what we're afraid of right and
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of what this bill is is
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
that everyone has a story but no one
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
when you get down to the bases no one
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
can find the facts of the story in the
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
back end so it's not really there um so
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
i i don't like boogeyman legislation
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere might be afraid of but no one
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
ever no one's ever seen it and so that's
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
why i'll support uh
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
not recommended for future legislation
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
seeing no other testimony i recognize
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative smith for a motion
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'll make a motion
 
01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
on hb 1091 to not recommend for future
 
01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:22.309 align:start position:0%
on hb 1091 to not recommend for future
legislation

01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
one second i'm going to give
 
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's been moved far on a house bill 1091
 
01:09:37.829 --> 01:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
uh the committee report direct to
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
reference it's not recommended for
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
i will
 
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i have to do i have to
 
01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
do a actual roll call vote can we do a
 
01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
straw poll and because it's an interim
 
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
study report not a well it's going to go
 
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
great you just want me to do work
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
um all right so
 
01:09:59.350 --> 01:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
seeing no further discussion will again
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%

01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
next we'll have the work session on
 
01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
house bill 1201
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
relative to damage by bears
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
um again i'll summarize what i heard in
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
testimony was if we remember this bill
 
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
was just recently modified
 
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2
 
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
the trailer bill
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
in that in that modification one of the
 
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
conditions they set
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
was that in order for
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
members to get
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
future payments for bear damage to
 
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
property by bears
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
the fish and game would potentially
 
01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
offer mitigation strategies to the
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
person who applied for the money the
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
first time and if they don't do those
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
mitigation strategies they could not get
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
a second year disbursement if they
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
didn't take care of the mitigation all
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
that being said i will say i think it
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
was last month colonel jordan i think
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
the rules finally went into place for
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
this so we don't even have what the
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
mitigation strategies would look like
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
what would potentially happen um so we
 
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
have absolutely zero data on on the on
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
on the changes we've already made
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
so i'm inclined to say not recommended
 
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
for future legislation again only
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
because we don't have any data to change
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
something that we just changed not a
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
year ago
 
01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
and so that is my general summary of
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
what i heard and and my impression of
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
what i heard i'll open it up for colonel
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
jordan you want to add anything to that
 
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
so still still waiting to be still
 
01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
drafted but not presented to jail call
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
yet i'm assuming is that where we're at
 
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
maybe i'll see him this friday
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
um any other discussion on house bill
 
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
1201 fn relative damage by bears
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative wolf
 
01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
did you say that the
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
law that went into effect as part of the
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
trailer bill limits you to recovery
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
two times
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
i i didn't no the changes i understand
 
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
it that was put into house bill 2 said
 
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
added a mitigation component saying that
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
instead of just saying every year you
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
could just apply and you just can apply
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
and that was the only condition if you
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
apply efficient game will assess whether
 
01:13:11.189 --> 01:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
or not there are any mitigation
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
strategies that could be imposed that
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
would make it so it doesn't happen a
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
second time and if they recommend
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
mitigation strategies to a claimant
 
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
on this fund and the claimant chooses
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
not to implement the mitigation
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
strategies they probably won't get a
 
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
second payment because they didn't do it
 
01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
fishing game asked them
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's two strikes and if you don't
 
01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:31.669 align:start position:0%
it's two strikes and if you don't
mitigate

01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
mitigate
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
you're out correct that's basically
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding of the way the
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
rule the rule the
 
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
the new change was and the rules are
 
01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
being worked on rules are currently
 
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
seeing no further discussion i recognize
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%

seen thank you
 
01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:14.229 align:start position:0%
seen thank you
i

01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
one other thing i just want to bring
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
over from the senate i attended a couple
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
of the hearings they passed the senate
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
passed unanimously one of our app the
 
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
ammo bill that cleaned up the language
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
around ammunition
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
the cam game cam bill is going to be
 
01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
amended and i'll send an email out to
 
01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
everybody once i get it back right now
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
it looks like fish and game is not in
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
favor of the i mean the senate's not in
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
favor of the 10-hour rule we put in or
 
01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
the written recommendation they seem to
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
be okay with the labeling requirement
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
and senator bradley offered an amendment
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
that says if you put in a tree stand
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to take the tree stand out
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
by december 31st which i'm not generally
 
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
um so we will have probably an email and
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
just about concurrence whether we'll
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
concur or not without with that change
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
that they do if if they move the bill
 
01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
forward they may just kill it too so
 
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
um but other than that i think
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
they they passed the hike safe card um i
 
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
remember what the other one was it was a
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
fourth one
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
we sent it the squirrel bill has not
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
come together bill has not gone in front
 
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee yet
 
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
