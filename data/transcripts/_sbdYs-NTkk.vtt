00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
if we do it they'll think it's something
 
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
speaking going on if we do without
 
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
notice i think there's something sneaky
 
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
going on and just the best thing to do
 
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to report that as requested
 
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
i spoke with the chair
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
of science technology and energy and he
 
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
looked at the bill and said
 
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
we don't care about notification
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
requirements uh
 
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
they were when they had it last year
 
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 align:start position:0%

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
weather modification
 
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
and that's why they had issues with it
 
00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
this this time
 
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 align:start position:0%

weather with no advanced notification
 
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%

and the temptation to try to do
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
something about that
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
businesses have received during the
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
state of emergency
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
so that's just a brief overview i'll go
 
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.150 align:start position:0%
so that's just a brief overview i'll go
over

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
the exact changes so in
 
00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
section c1
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
roman roman 1 in the section of
 
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.110 align:start position:0%
roman roman 1 in the section of
contractor

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
it adds language that uh
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
in any manner have entered into a
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
contract to perform a service for so it
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
enters that twice
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
to perform a service for and so this
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh you know an actual service being
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
provided to the state
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
not something for pencils or uh you know
 
00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.069 align:start position:0%
not something for pencils or uh you know
some

00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
some supplies that's a product so
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
you see the difference there um
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
it it changes a few things in rsa 10c
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
colon 2 roman v
 
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
subsection a1 and it just cleans up some
 
00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
of the language we got some feedback
 
00:13:56.399 --> 00:13:56.790 align:start position:0%
of the language we got some feedback
that

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm on page three of the amendment
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
near the bottom
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm in section one there where it
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
starts the head of each agency
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
it strikes the word shall use his or her
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
authority under
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
so if it'll just read the head of each
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
agency shall
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
ensure that the agency aj voice and so
 
00:14:18.959 --> 00:14:19.590 align:start position:0%
ensure that the agency aj voice and so
forth

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
forth
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
so it strikes some of that redundant
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
language there and then on line three
 
00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
it removes the the statement for
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
purposes of the section
 
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
comma training and quotes it takes that
 
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.629 align:start position:0%
comma training and quotes it takes that
out

00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
because that was also viewed as
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
redundant and then finally that same
 
00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:35.030 align:start position:0%
redundant and then finally that same
section

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
the very last line it adds the roman
 
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:38.870 align:start position:0%
the very last line it adds the roman
numeral

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
numeral
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
to so it'll read rsa 10-c colon 1 comma
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
ii which is the list of divisive
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
concepts in the definition section
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
and then the last change that i
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the general provisions on
 
00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
page four
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
it adds a new roman numeral three and
 
00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.069 align:start position:0%
it adds a new roman numeral three and
renumbers

00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
renumbers
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
the previous three to four
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
and i'll just read that for the record
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
it says nothing in this chapter
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
is meant to include as a contract or
 
00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.150 align:start position:0%
is meant to include as a contract or
subcontract

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
subcontract
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
certain government financial assistance
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to the taking
 
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
or receiving of loans tax credits tax
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
incentives tax abatements or gifts
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
deriving from money sent
 
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
from the federal government or agency
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
designed or meant
 
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
to assist during or after a declared
 
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.670 align:start position:0%
to assist during or after a declared
emergency

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
including but including but not limited
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
to health weather
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
riot civil disobedience or acts of
 
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
foreign agents
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
or designed as economic stimulus during
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
economic emergency
 
00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
so there was a uh there was a summer
 
00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519 align:start position:0%
camp for kids
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
that raised this issue um they received
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
care money
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
would this bill affect them and so that
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
that provision was put in
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
to exempt uh situations unusual
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
situations like we've had this last year
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
so that if the state was distributing
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
money designed as stimulus
 
00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
or uh you know to make a business hole
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
for having to shut down because of
 
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.430 align:start position:0%
for having to shut down because of
emergence

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
emergence
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
that they'd be exempted from from this
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
so that that concludes my explanation
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions for
 
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.189 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions for
representative

00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
i have a question madam chair yes
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative amman if you
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
i i don't i'm not
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
seeing the language that you have just
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
read to us
 
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh in the copy that i was sent so i'm
 
00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:25.670 align:start position:0%
uh in the copy that i was sent so i'm
just

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
questioning you as you were reading it
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
you used the word
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
i couldn't tell whether you were saying
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
insure or
 
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
ensure and i just want to make sure that
 
00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.030 align:start position:0%
ensure and i just want to make sure that
uh

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
that we have we don't use the word
 
00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:40.230 align:start position:0%
that we have we don't use the word
insurer

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
insurer
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
which has two meanings in english the
 
00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
more common being
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh not the desired meaning here
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
so does the copy read ensure
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't use either word actually oh
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
yeah so i'm speaking to i'm speaking to
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
the amendment um
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
which is a single page document right
 
00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:02.079 align:start position:0%
the section he was reading is line 17
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
through 22 on the amendment
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't see the word insure or
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
ensure i think i may have used the word
 
00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:10.949 align:start position:0%
ensure i think i may have used the word
ensure

00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
ensure
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
so that was uh is that is that the
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
correct use of the word
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
yes sorry online nine the head of each
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
agency shall
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
ensure that the agency oh that's great
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you both that's that's my issue
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
that's line nine i have i have similar
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
peeves like when people pronounce the
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
word sandwich
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
and they say sandwich that just hurts my
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
ears when i hear that okay
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis returning to the
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
is my understanding accurate that this
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
amendment does two things removes
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
redundancy and just narrows the scope
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
of what this this bill would apply to
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
other questions representative schuett
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um representative
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
eminent it appears that
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
uh you've made a couple of carveouts for
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
groups uh regarding this bill
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
receiving federal funds and so forth
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
does this not indicate to you that there
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
may be
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
further unintended consequences from
 
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
groups that just
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
are not aware of this bill yet
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh no it doesn't and um you know
 
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.549 align:start position:0%
uh no it doesn't and um you know
sometimes

00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
it's a tactic to sow doubt about a bill
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
to get people to
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
you know feel unsure of it that that uh
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
that amendment deals with private it
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
it clarifies that private uh companies

see the seco
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
science center which is a museum

a children's camp
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
be well i'm i'm bringing up the camp
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
analogy because
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
now i'm curious as to yes so you're
 
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.430 align:start position:0%
now i'm curious as to yes so you're
getting

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
you're getting focused on a camp but
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
what what the amendment the amendment
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't deal with camps it deals with
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
any business including restaurants
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
all the businesses that have received uh
 
00:20:25.919 --> 00:20:26.630 align:start position:0%
all the businesses that have received uh
money

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
money

because of the covid situation that's
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
what that
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
that uh that new section to the build
 
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
does is it
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
says even though you receive state money
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
because of a state of emergency
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
that this would not apply to you because
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
you're not doing uh business
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
for the state in your normal course no
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with summer camps it
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
has to do with
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
just about every business in our state
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
reticence in our committee to uh

that it was a rather important
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
anniversary to recognize so i had the
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
amendment drafted
 
00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:12.400 align:start position:0%

adopt this amendment
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
and pass the bill if there's any way
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
that we could
 
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
attempt to expedite the house's action
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
on it uh as we're coming up close to the
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
okay in response to my second i would
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
say that
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%

commemoration and
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
i hope that the town of newmarket will
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
honor him every year because that's the
 
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
most appropriate place for it
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
um i don't know when the house will next
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
meet but
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that we'll we get this
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
out of our committee and over to the
 
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
house so that
 
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
it can be passed at the earliest
 
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.190 align:start position:0%
it can be passed at the earliest
opportunity

represent scitec um
 
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
sure but there's a bigger picture here
 
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:23.990 align:start position:0%
sure but there's a bigger picture here
because

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
we have own owner judge
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
stains also and i
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
really would like to discuss both of
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
these together
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh because i like the idea of naming
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
the uh the building at peas after
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
after this man actually uh
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
i've sort of been concerned that my
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
education has been 15 minutes
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
on this and i'd like to get more
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable with it but i really want to
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
go in this direction
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
i've no i'm not really discussing this
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
amendment i'll stop at this point but
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
there's a bigger picture here is
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
yes i think we can discuss naming the
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
airport terminals
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
under the other bill we will note that
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%

i'm

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:09.740 align:start position:0%
i'm

00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:15.519 align:start position:0%
i'm moving that because we are we have a
 
00:32:15.519 --> 00:32:16.389 align:start position:0%
i'm moving that because we are we have a
very

00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
severely limited amount of time
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
in session due to the difficulties
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
of arrangements and um
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
and so we we have been asked not to pass
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
or not not to move to the floor anything
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
that we think will have a debate if it's
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
not a
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
vitally important bill and i think this
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
qualifies as not vitally important
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
since it was 1828 this is isn't even a
 
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.230 align:start position:0%
since it was 1828 this is isn't even a
specific

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
timing for any any uh anniversary it
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
will be just as valid to declare this
 
00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:53.519 align:start position:0%
starting next year
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
so i suggest to billy routine
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
madam chair i also have a point i'm
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
sorry representative pearson
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing doing a little
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
research the the bill is actually
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
historically inaccurate the first labor
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
strike that was done predominantly
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
by women was done in pawtucket rhode
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
island in may of 1824.
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
oh madam chair i actually
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
think that this has been debated by
 
00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.590 align:start position:0%
think that this has been debated by
historians

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
historians
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
and the majority say
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative schultz how can 1828
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
be before 1824
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
the nature of the uh labor dispute
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
as i understand it it's sort of like
 
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:44.470 align:start position:0%
as i understand it it's sort of like
when

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
when people claim to have invented the
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
cheeseburger in a way
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of places claim to have invented
 
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
the cheeseburger do you know what i mean
 
00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:52.789 align:start position:0%
the cheeseburger do you know what i mean
like

00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
but the historic historians say the
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
first one is the one
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire because of the um
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
it the extent of the uh labor dispute
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
compared to what happened in rhode
 
00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.270 align:start position:0%
compared to what happened in rhode
island

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
island
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
is um wasn't an extensive labor
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
union that gives me even more reason to
 
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
say we should postpone this debate if
 
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.030 align:start position:0%
say we should postpone this debate if
the

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
historians argued representative schuett
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair i'm just kiss um
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
is this an attempt to enable new
 
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh again i think that if we want to
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
i think we need to to look into this a
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
little further and
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
i don't have the time to to work on it
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
all right representative goalie
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you manager uh madam chair
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
you know as well as i know that we get
 
00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
four or five
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
maybe sometimes six bills each year
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
looking to name days
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
for the governor to proclaim on a yearly
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
basis there's currently a
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
list that is growing every year in
 
00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.670 align:start position:0%
list that is growing every year in
statute

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
and i i think sometimes it's a
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
disservice for some of those because
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
if you look at the list most people
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
don't know what those days are or are
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
unaware of them so i'm not sure that
 
00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:24.550 align:start position:0%
unaware of them so i'm not sure that
they

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
actually do what they're
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
intended to do and you know i think it's
 
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
nice that the governor proclaimed maybe
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
once or twice
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
to get something kicked off and then the
 
00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.390 align:start position:0%
to get something kicked off and then the
organization

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
keeps the ball rolling so i will support
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
the retain because uh
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
i think it's just a little going a
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
little too far thank you
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
yes well if if uh you think we should be
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
killing this bill instead i'm okay with
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
that too
 
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%
representative i'll have what
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
actually that that's a good point if i
 
00:36:05.839 --> 00:36:06.950 align:start position:0%
actually that that's a good point if i
uh

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt you have your
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
hand raised i do madam chair
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
um being a representative of dover and
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh i would
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
like to point out to the committee and i
 
00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
in support of uh your motion to
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
retain the bill and especially in light
 
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839 align:start position:0%
somewhat insert uncertainty as to
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
whether rhode island was first and so
 
00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:28.390 align:start position:0%
whether rhode island was first and so
forth

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
forth
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh city of dover has actually already
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
had a celebration
 
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
and there was a video created
 
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
that was quite instructive with regard
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
event it's something that the city of
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
dover clearly
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
thinks is is of significance and we may
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
find in
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
in our treatment of it in the retention
 
00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.109 align:start position:0%
in our treatment of it in the retention
period

00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh that we come to understand and
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
and also firm up the
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
historical accuracy um and perhaps even
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
see the video so
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh i'm in favor of the retention motion
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
thank you remember
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know this is not going to be
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
pleasant but i'm going to say it
 
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
the fact is we gave pollyanna day or
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
whatever that thing is
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
and this is far more significant as far
 
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
as i am concerned the first
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
women's strike even though not
 
00:37:21.359 --> 00:37:22.069 align:start position:0%
women's strike even though not
successful

00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
or uh walk out whatever
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
this is this deserves some kind of real
 
00:37:27.359 --> 00:37:28.550 align:start position:0%
this is this deserves some kind of real
commemoration

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
commemoration
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do pollyanna well i've
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
what he said all right well that's
 
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
fine i like since there's not a strong
 
00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.630 align:start position:0%
fine i like since there's not a strong
um

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
opinion in favor of vote to pass but
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
we'll retain it representative
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
schmidt will do some research in dover
 
00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:49.990 align:start position:0%
schmidt will do some research in dover
and

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
i will happily okay um madam chair i do
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
have a question i'm sorry
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
is my hand not raised i yes it is sorry
 
00:37:58.880 --> 00:37:59.190 align:start position:0%
is my hand not raised i yes it is sorry
i

00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
didn't that's okay that's okay i just
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that my hand is raised
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you i just want to make sure
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
that and i'm sure that you're
 
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
that you're able to manage this but i
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
just want to be sure that if we retain
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
bills we're going to work on them
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm concerned that the number of
 
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
bills that we retain so far
 
00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
so that what are your plans on are we
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
are you going to put subcommittees
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
together to work on these bills what do
 
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
you have plans on
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
i've set up subcommittees already and
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
in most cases we'll i'll assign the
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
bills after crossover because i don't
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
think we'll be retaining any senate
 
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:34.950 align:start position:0%
think we'll be retaining any senate
bills

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
once we get the get through crossover
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
we'll set it up
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
and i think that the
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
subcommittees ought to meet relatively
 
00:38:45.599 --> 00:38:45.990 align:start position:0%
subcommittees ought to meet relatively
soon

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
soon
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
like in april or may to make a plan for
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
the bills
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
okay and this one i think the
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is going to say
 
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:55.839 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt give us a report
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
in october and uh we'll vote on it then
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
um others will take more work by more
 
00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.950 align:start position:0%
um others will take more work by more
people

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
yes i'm especially concerned about the
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
daycare bill the daycare
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
so exactly that one will take some
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
serious work

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:47.589 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
and this one is time critical so it's
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
ought to pass progress on scitec
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative roy
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
he would just speak to your motion
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
briefly and that is that
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's hard to think of more significant
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
events in our
 
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional republic or amendments
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
that were made this is a
 
00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
significant i'm not a big fan of days
 
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
and memorials but this is a one-time
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
thing it is i can't it's a very it's
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
hard to think of something that trumps
 
00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.030 align:start position:0%
hard to think of something that trumps
this

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh maybe i don't use that verb that's uh
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
better than this
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh so i i think the i think the
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
memorial day is fitting
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
firsthand ferrari uh i would just uh
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
adopt representative sites okay so
 
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to comment
 
00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:50.630 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to comment
[Music]

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
um yes representative yes thank you
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
um i'll just state that
 
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
i believe that representative scitec um
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
schmidt and i probably all
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
started voting well before this age was
 
00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.069 align:start position:0%
started voting well before this age was
lowered

00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
lowered
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
so i think it's an important thing to
 
00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:13.829 align:start position:0%
so i think it's an important thing to
recognize

00:44:13.829 --> 00:44:13.839 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
that this enabled a lot more of our
 
00:44:16.319 --> 00:44:17.270 align:start position:0%
that this enabled a lot more of our
citizenry

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
citizenry
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
to chime in on issues of national
 
00:44:21.119 --> 00:44:22.870 align:start position:0%
to chime in on issues of national
importance

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
importance
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
at the risk of exposing my age i turned
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
18 that summer
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
and voted in the local elections in 1971
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
i can't remember anything before high
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
school so it doesn't matter
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
i graduated in high school that year so
 
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
let's uh talk about
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
that if i may yeah i just want to add
 
00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.630 align:start position:0%
that if i may yeah i just want to add
that

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
it's important today as it was then um
 
00:44:51.359 --> 00:44:51.670 align:start position:0%
it's important today as it was then um
but

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
at that particular time i think they had
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of importance
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
um because we had young people serving
 
00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
in in vietnam
 
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
who were old enough to serve but not old
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
enough to vote
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
and we as a society decided to correct
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
that and
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
pour drink or drink indeed yes actually
 
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
the trekking age was wasn't lowered
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
until uh
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
the next year yeah that was all thank
 
00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:15.030 align:start position:0%
the next year yeah that was all thank
you

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else have a comment
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative allegro
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
i remember this debate at the time and
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
even though i was a very young man
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
i never understood the logic of being
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
able to send people off
 
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
to war without giving him the
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh vote on those sending them and to
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
have a beer when they got home
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
however i do have to say that if we had
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
a memorial or a day for every single
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
wrong that we corrected in our 200 plus
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
year history
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh we would be even more inundated than
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
we are now so i'm
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not in favor of this but i i'm in
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
it is a one-time event oh
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
and i would also say that my first duty
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
station was west germany
 
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
i was 18 and uh the drinking age did not
 
00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:13.839 align:start position:0%

yes representative o'brien yes
 
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
the chair yes 18 to nothing all right
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
does anyone object to consent
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair um and it'll be on the
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
i may i um are we going to vote on the
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
yet on the consent it was the only one
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
person i just think
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
in light of only one person any one
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
person can take something off consent
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
so one person is all that's needed to
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
keep it from going on consent in the
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
first place
 
00:47:55.349 --> 00:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
what was the final ask my colleague to
 
00:47:55.359 --> 00:47:56.150 align:start position:0%
what was the final ask my colleague to
reconsider

00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
reconsider
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
since uh our days in the house
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
are very long and i don't really think a
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
floor debate on this is necessary
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
i would say that with a that with an 18
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
to nothing committee recommendation
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
the chances of a floor debate are
 
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:13.829 align:start position:0%
the chances of a floor debate are
minimal

00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
minimal
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
well i'd like to point out that the lead
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill is the democratic
 
00:48:18.079 --> 00:48:18.870 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill is the democratic
leader

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
leader
 
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
and this is a wonderful moment of
 
00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:21.910 align:start position:0%
and this is a wonderful moment of
bipartisanship

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
bipartisanship
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
and i know the speaker is seeking those
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
moments as well
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
and i'm so happy to see a bipartisan
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
support for you
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
for 18 to 20 year olds voting
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
it probably won't be a long thing on the
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
house floor but it is
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
isn't it nice to have so no i'm not
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
withdrawing my
 
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%
your that's not a problem representative
 
00:48:44.559 --> 00:48:45.910 align:start position:0%
your that's not a problem representative
fellows

00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
fellows
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
um yes madam chair i i just wanted to
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
point out that
 
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
the date that we're trying to celebrate
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
is may
 
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
13th of this year
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
and that's not very far away if it's on
 
00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:02.079 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar we know
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
the first day that the house meets it
 
00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:06.559 align:start position:0%
will pass and it can go on
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
and if it's not on the consent calendar
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
we might not even get to it in those
 
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
three days
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
or we'll get to it in the last of the
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
three days
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
it's fortunately we're relatively early
 
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
in the alphabetical order so
 
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's likely to come come up on the first
 
00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:24.710 align:start position:0%
it's likely to come come up on the first
day

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
in fact last uh last session we
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
our bills came up before launch for the
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
first part
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
and yes we'll do our best to make sure
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's efficiently handled
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
and madam chair i just want to add i
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
totally respect the remarks you made at
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
the beginning of our exact session
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
about what the consent calendar does
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
etc and i'm mindful of all of that
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
i just want to say i am mindful of that
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
while i made
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
my objection to consent
 
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
that's fine representative
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
first a couple of sentences on the floor
 
00:50:04.079 --> 00:50:05.030 align:start position:0%
first a couple of sentences on the floor
uh

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
this is not going to take any more time
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
than for the speaker to read it
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be a fight but the
 
00:50:11.829 --> 00:50:11.839 align:start position:0%
point that you did not make
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative schultz is this
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
this is in the consent calendar things
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
are often buried
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
it'd be nice that the house actually saw
 
00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.270 align:start position:0%
it'd be nice that the house actually saw
this

00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
for the brief moment that it takes
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative scitec
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
that's what i meant to say
 
00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
all right excellent let's go on before
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
moving on before
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
we we have another uh all right
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair if i may just ask a question
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
of the chair
 
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
i'm curious i'm still not seeing
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
the status of house bill 130
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
which our committee voted on back
 
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
february 18th
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
and i will check and see what happened
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
to it thank you
 
00:50:59.829 --> 00:50:59.839 align:start position:0%
and i will mention representative
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
schuett that i was
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
looking at house bill 2 and there's a
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
section in there that deals with that
 
00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:06.630 align:start position:0%
section in there that deals with that
issue

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
so if you would take a look at house
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
bill 2 and see
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
see if it agrees yes madam chair i did
 
00:51:14.319 --> 00:51:15.109 align:start position:0%
see if it agrees yes madam chair i did
actually

00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
see that someone called it to my
 
00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.309 align:start position:0%
see that someone called it to my
attention

00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
attention
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm not quite sure i believe
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
that um that is something being put
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
forward by
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
administrative services and
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
uh therefore that's why i'm concerned
 
00:51:31.599 --> 00:51:32.630 align:start position:0%
uh therefore that's why i'm concerned
about

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:35.839 align:start position:0%
having this committee's opinion go
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
forward because we voted on it
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
before that he appeared exactly
 
00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
if so if you would you would check house
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
bill 2 to see if it
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
to see how it compares and we will uh
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
i'll mention to uh finance that we've
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
already voted on house
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
on house bill 130 and it it should take
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
precedence thank you we'll see
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
all right next what else have we got
 
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
all right and i'm also going to move to
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.839 --> 00:52:19.430 align:start position:0%
 
day

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:30.839 --> 00:52:34.069 align:start position:0%
 
was

00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
unless representative goalie suggests we
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
should just kill it but i think it would
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
that would involve more debate than a

birthday is
 
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%

which we debated somewhat at our last
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%

thank you okay
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your motion yes and
 
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to go through everything i
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
went through the other day when we
 
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
actually began debate on this i'll just
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
simply say
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
that um government
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
intended to interfere with the personal
 
00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.150 align:start position:0%
intended to interfere with the personal
relationships

00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
relationships
 
00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
uh and friendly activities between
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
neighbors friends
 
00:55:36.069 --> 00:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
and family uh meanwhile
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh the current leader structure which
 
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
this bill would alleviate
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
the current legal structure indicates
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
that it's a like i say misdemeanor for
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
me to cut my wife's hair
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
i think that's way beyond the pale um
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
and activity between consenting adults
 
00:55:52.559 --> 00:55:53.109 align:start position:0%
and activity between consenting adults
or

00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
a consenting adult and a child for whom
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:56:00.789 --> 00:56:00.799 align:start position:0%
um care and custody of
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh again it should not be interfered
 
00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:03.990 align:start position:0%
uh again it should not be interfered
with

00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
by the government so if i choose to put
 
00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:09.030 align:start position:0%
by the government so if i choose to put
my

00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
granddaughter's thumbnails um
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
lastly i hear a lot of evidence about
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
perils of putting chemicals in people's
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
hair chemicals like
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
head and shoulder shampoo and miss
 
00:56:23.359 --> 00:56:25.270 align:start position:0%
head and shoulder shampoo and miss
clairol

00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
clairol
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
i just don't see it as a real peril and
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
i haven't heard any numbers i just keep
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
hearing about the threat
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
but i've never heard a thing where
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
someone could tell me yes
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
840 people were hospitalized with scalp
 
00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:39.109 align:start position:0%
840 people were hospitalized with scalp
burns

00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
burns
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
last year in new hampshire it's because
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
those numbers don't exist
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
so i'll just leave it at that and
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
if need be i can chime in again later i
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
i hope that
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
this will just be supported
 
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
um i would uh second his um comments and
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
i would add one other comment um some
 
00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:03.829 align:start position:0%
i would add one other comment um some
people

00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
have said that you know this no one's
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
being arrested for cutting their child's
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
hair and no one's being prosecuted for
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
dying their girlfriends hair um
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
well that's true then it shouldn't be in
 
00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:17.589 align:start position:0%
well that's true then it shouldn't be in
statute

00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:20.799 align:start position:0%
so let's fix it okay
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
representative uh yes as i think
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
the chair mentioned we talked before um
 
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
having laws which are um
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
in place but are not enforced and
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
leaving it to the discretion of the
 
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
people enforcing it
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
i think is a very bad practice for a
 
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
number of reasons
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm very strongly opposed to it i
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
mean people are supposed to
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
be able to know what the law is and
 
00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
follow the law
 
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
and you know if it's not written down
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
under what circumstances the law implies
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
in what circumstances it doesn't
 
00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
that's not good um it you know maybe it
 
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a big issue in this case but
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
it can lead to
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
discretionary enforcement where uh you
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
know law enforcement or other people
 
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
in authority can choose to apply the law
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
to some individuals and not others for
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
whatever reason
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is is if people know
 
00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
that something's illegal
 
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
and they're regularly breaking the law
 
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
that does not contribute to respect for
 
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
the law either
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
and so for a number of reasons it's uh
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
it's just a very bad practice and i uh
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
all right representative fought now
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
um i i cannot support this bill because
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
even though i agree with the
 
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
representatives that spoke before me
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
that i don't think it should be against
 
00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
the law for
 
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
a mother to cut the child's hair
 
00:58:48.789 --> 00:58:48.799 align:start position:0%
this bill allows me to set up a
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
barber shop in my driveway now and
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
and provide all those services for all
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
of my neighbors
 
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
or and strangers with no regard to any
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
of my skills
 
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
um uh or relationship to these other
 
00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:02.630 align:start position:0%
um uh or relationship to these other
people

00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
so you know for that reason i think uh
 
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's the reason that we have
 
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
laws in place i also hold a
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
an electrician's license uh and a
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
realtor's license but i don't think that
 
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
people without those licenses
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
should be able to set up shop all over
 
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
town simply because they
 
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
are not charging a fee in my business we
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh it's clarified that compensation
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
um is not uh
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
does not make a difference on
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
representation so
 
00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh whether i get paid for my service or
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
not i'm
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
still liable so for that reason i can't
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you from scitec a couple things
 
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
first representative front know the
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
chances of setting up
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
barbershop in your driveway or doing
 
00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:50.549 align:start position:0%
barbershop in your driveway or doing
massive

00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
massive
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
work for free that's a number as close
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
to zero as i can imagine
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
but there's an issue that uh even i'll
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
not surprisingly i'll vote for the bill
 
01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:00.710 align:start position:0%
not surprisingly i'll vote for the bill
but

01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
there's an issue here that deserves some
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
thought and some study
 
01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
and that's if it's a matter of public
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
health and
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
safety the chemicals in the hair
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh scalper there's there's
 
01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
i have to think about that i'm not
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
prepared it's not a crusade i want to go
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
on but it's something that
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
should be thought about because look i
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
can't tell you that i saw
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
or you would not be happy if i said i
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
saw a youtube video this morning and i'm
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
ready to take out your appendix because
 
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
you've consented
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
and after all it's through people i'm
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
not charging uh
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
there's something to be uh i don't know
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
where i'm
 
01:00:43.589 --> 01:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
i know where i want to go but i don't
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
want to study this issue but there
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
are elements here you talk about public
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
health or safety
 
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
and you mean it as a it deserves
 
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
some thought and that's all right
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chairman i i
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
agree with the debate that uh this
 
01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.549 align:start position:0%
agree with the debate that uh this
probably

01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
rarely happens but uh and
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
i can see somebody having the opinion
 
01:01:11.829 --> 01:01:11.839 align:start position:0%
that it is selective for
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
certain people to like enforce a law but
 
01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:15.030 align:start position:0%
certain people to like enforce a law but
there's

01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
also a point that i think we must
 
01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.150 align:start position:0%
also a point that i think we must
consider

01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
in those situations where something
 
01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:21.670 align:start position:0%
in those situations where something
becomes

01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
truly egregious that has occurred
 
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
where can the person fall back on
 
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
and to uh have something that is in law
 
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
that can't apply so therefore i cannot
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
support this
 
01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
bill because i think the current law is
 
01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:41.910 align:start position:0%
bill because i think the current law is
adequate

01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's enforced or not but in
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
those egregious type of situations
 
01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
it will apply a vehicle that can be used
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
by the proper authorities
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
if they deem fit that the situation was
 
01:01:55.599 --> 01:01:56.549 align:start position:0%
if they deem fit that the situation was
egregious

01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
egregious
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
and allow the proper legal authorities
 
01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
to which i have full faith into our
 
01:02:02.799 --> 01:02:03.829 align:start position:0%
to which i have full faith into our
prosecutorial

01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh prosecutorial friends the attorney
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
is to determine which cases are
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
legitimately that can be tried thank you
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
representative schuett thank you madam
 
01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.230 align:start position:0%
representative schuett thank you madam
chair

01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
i i sort of echo what representative
 
01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
o'brien just said uh
 
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
i was actually a little disappointed i
 
01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
knew um
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
this would probably come up again it's
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
been tried a few times
 
01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
and i was a little disappointed that the
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
language came out
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
so similar as to has previously been
 
01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.430 align:start position:0%
so similar as to has previously been
denied

01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
denied
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
i would like to see something
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
that would ease the case of a family
 
01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.870 align:start position:0%
that would ease the case of a family
member

01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
member
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
cutting someone's hair for example but
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
i think there does need to be something
 
01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
in law
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
that would enable someone who does these
 
01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
kinds of things
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
in a nefarious manner to be
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
prosecutable so i will be voting
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
against this so thank you representative
 
01:03:05.039 --> 01:03:06.549 align:start position:0%
against this so thank you representative
fellows

01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
fellows
 
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i think one of
 
01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:10.150 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i think one of
the

01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:12.799 align:start position:0%
reasons i have to vote against this bill
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
is that i think it opens up the
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity for someone to
 
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
parlor in their home and go completely
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
under the radar
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
and they can take
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
fees from the people they provide
 
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
services to
 
01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
and if an inspector can ever find them
 
01:03:36.799 --> 01:03:37.190 align:start position:0%
and if an inspector can ever find them
which

01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
may not be the case if they don't have a
 
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
sign or they don't advertise on the
 
01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.750 align:start position:0%
sign or they don't advertise on the
internet

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
internet
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
then they will just they
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
they will just go under the radar and if
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
the inspector does come by they'll say
 
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
oh well i don't get paid you know i'm
 
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
just doing it for a friend
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
and uh the other thing that i'm
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
is if we do that in this particular
 
01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
statute do we have to do it in other
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
places also
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know for for anything that that
 
01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:06.390 align:start position:0%
you know for for anything that that
people

01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know for putting
 
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
you know ointment on a on a kid's knee
 
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
for using um prescribed medications
 
01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:17.349 align:start position:0%
for using um prescribed medications
under

01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
that a doctor gives you know where do
 
01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
you draw the line for this
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
and if the if the concern is within a
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
family it it ought to stay within a
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
family and not
 
01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
for not do the remuneration
 
01:04:34.109 --> 01:04:34.119 align:start position:0%
edit to this statute thank you
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
representatives um if someone does this
 
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
and causes someone else serious harm
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
there was concern that uh
 
01:04:44.069 --> 01:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
there was no legal recourse i don't
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
think that's true because
 
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
you know in any case if you harm
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
somebody they're open to a civil suit
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
you've committed a tort against them
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
and so if somebody does cause serious
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
harm doing this there is a remedy
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
and uh that could also act as deterrent
 
01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:00.069 align:start position:0%
and uh that could also act as deterrent
from

01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
that that possibility can act as a
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
deterrent from somebody doing something
 
01:05:05.349 --> 01:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
particularly dangerous i mean it won't
 
01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily fix all problems
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
but at least the person harmed would get
 
01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
um i would just in response to some of
 
01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
the things representative phillips said
 
01:05:18.079 --> 01:05:18.390 align:start position:0%
the things representative phillips said
the

01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
um someone could do that now this law
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't change anything someone can open
 
01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
up a secret
 
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh salon right now and so the law
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
is irrelevant to that scenario second of
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
all i
 
01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:34.559 align:start position:0%
think that in a in a society such as
 
01:05:35.589 --> 01:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
ours we you know
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
the the old latin phrase you know
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
to the buyer beware we we really need to
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
people let people have the decision if
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
someone decides you know i'm going to
 
01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:47.839 align:start position:0%
have my girlfriend cut my hair
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
and it comes out horrible well she
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
should have went to a licensed
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
place that had it done that i mean it's
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
the same thing if i
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
have some body work done in my car by
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
someone who's
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
not licensed to train and it comes out
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
looking horrible i should have
 
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
not gone to them i should have paid the
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
extra you know you get what you paid for
 
01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:05.750 align:start position:0%
extra you know you get what you paid for
it

01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
um and in this case it's not even paid
 
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
for it's free so
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
i just think that at some level we have
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
to trust our own citizens to make their
 
01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
own decisions
 
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
okay representative bailey
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
i believe several times fees or payment
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
have been mentioned where
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
i believe it explicitly says that this
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
exempts only those things provided
 
01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you representative
 
01:06:41.839 --> 01:06:44.950 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you representative
goalie

01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i just need to
 
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
um speak to the buyer beware i think
 
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of laws are on the books to
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
protect those that are vulnerable
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
um we know our elderly are specifically
 
01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and to just use the language
 
01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
let the buyer beware i don't think is
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
something we should be uh using as a
 
01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:09.349 align:start position:0%
something we should be uh using as a
guideline

01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
guideline
 
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
um i think we're here to protect those
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
citizens and
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
this is one way of doing that so
 
01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
i'll be voting against this
 
01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:21.990 align:start position:0%
i'll be voting against this
representative

01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i would just
 
01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.069 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i would just
rebut

01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
rebut
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
the comment of representative lakers
 
01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.510 align:start position:0%
the comment of representative lakers
about

01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
pursuing a civil suit if if you have a
 
01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.029 align:start position:0%
pursuing a civil suit if if you have a
problem

01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh number one that that would involve a
 
01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:36.870 align:start position:0%
uh number one that that would involve a
cost

01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
to the victim to pursue that and number
 
01:07:40.799 --> 01:07:41.510 align:start position:0%
to the victim to pursue that and number
two

01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
that's time consuming if someone is for
 
01:07:45.039 --> 01:07:46.150 align:start position:0%
that's time consuming if someone is for
example

01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
coloring people's hair uh involving
 
01:07:49.039 --> 01:07:49.910 align:start position:0%
coloring people's hair uh involving
chemicals

01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
chemicals
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
and the problem involves damage
 
01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
to the health or disfigurement whatever
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
that person basically could continue
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
if law enforcement couldn't step in
 
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
right away because of the law
 
01:08:07.589 --> 01:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
in the length of time that it would take
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
a suit to work its way through the court
 
01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
thank you representative right
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to clarify on the caveat
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
and tour
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
um the where necessary
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
to protect i mean first of all i don't
 
01:08:25.829 --> 01:08:25.839 align:start position:0%
think our seniors are in some great risk
 
01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
of world haircuts
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
but i i think that where it's serious
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
and it
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
it is dangerous uh to the example that
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative fought will give with
 
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
electrical codes that could cause fires
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
and electric
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
shock is different than you know getting
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
a bad haircut or
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
or and even to the and we talk about
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
scalp burns you can go to the store
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
and buy products to dye your own hair at
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
home if we're so worried about that
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps we should ban those
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
and you shouldn't be able to do it
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
yourself either um it's
 
01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
i mean at some point it becomes you know
 
01:08:57.279 --> 01:08:57.669 align:start position:0%
i mean at some point it becomes you know
so

01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's not just we're not
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
throwing people to the wolves and say
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
figure it out for yourselves but on some
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
issues that are
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
so simple as this i do not think that we
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
need to
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
exert such government oversight
 
01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:13.590 align:start position:0%
exert such government oversight
representative

01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you i just want to make a comment
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
the products that are sold in the
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
grocery store
 
01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:18.799 align:start position:0%
are nothing like the products that are
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
used in a
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
professional beauty salon so i think
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
that people need to understand that it's
 
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
not the same thing
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
um haircut you can tell that i don't
 
01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.390 align:start position:0%
um haircut you can tell that i don't
really

01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
right and so basically making decisions
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
on things that we're not really
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
fully um aware of
 
01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
and um what i'd like to say is if this
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
if this is something that's important to
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
the people the proponent of this bill
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
and there's something that they can come
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
up with that would make the other
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
the people who are opposed to bill more
 
01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:54.070 align:start position:0%
the people who are opposed to bill more
palliable

01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
palliable
 
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
such as only talking about family or or
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
relatives i would be open to that but as
 
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
the bill stands
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not in favor of it thank you
 
01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh to the comment
 
01:10:12.719 --> 01:10:13.189 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh to the comment
that

01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
hair products yes they are sold in the
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
local market and everything
 
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
but also too keep in mind just because
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
something is available to the public
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
does not necessarily mean it meets the
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
standards that are being discussed here
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh case in point
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
many variety stores or other type of
 
01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
shops do sell
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
marijuana type of pipes and devices
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
and uh cigarette papers that i don't
 
01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
think i use for cigarettes
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
and as far as i know federal law and
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
state law still hasn't recognized the
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
sale of marijuana yet they
 
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
some of these by-products are available
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
to the public but i just want to
 
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
clarify that point uh it is a people's
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
choice on what to do
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr madam chair so uh
 
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
again i'll come back to the point that
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
i've made in the past
 
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
that nobody's being prosecuted for
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
cutting their kids hair
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
and it's always about cutting kids hair
 
01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
but there are it's a whole panoply of
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
services that can be provided
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
for nothing for free uh under
 
01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
this proposed uh law and
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh this is not a problem that's that
 
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
it is causing any uh any kind of problem
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's an it's a solution in search of a
 
01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.310 align:start position:0%
it's an it's a solution in search of a
problem

01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
um and members of long-serving members
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
of time
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
long time serving members of this
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
community um
 
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
will recall the instance that we had of
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
the the gentleman that came in uh
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
he and his wife had been in a mall
 
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
where somebody uh was offering free
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
teeth whitening
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that's relevant
 
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
01:12:12.149 --> 01:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
but the point is it was offered for free
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
it was offered for free and the
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
assumption was
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
because it was the person appeared was
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
wearing a white coat
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
they thought well they knew what they
 
01:12:23.669 --> 01:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
were doing they were wearing a white
 
01:12:23.679 --> 01:12:24.550 align:start position:0%
were doing they were wearing a white
coat

01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
coat
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
a woman got severely burned her lips
 
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
and her gums are severely burned so
 
01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
people who are messing around with
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
chemicals and providing
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
home services of this nature it's not
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
just hair cutting
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
would be you know allowed to continue
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh doing what they're doing
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
including free haircuts for the elderly
 
01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
we heard that
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
testimony in committee
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
and so we've rejected this in the past
 
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
as a problem
 
01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
and you hear that we're going to be
 
01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:05.910 align:start position:0%
and you hear that we're going to be
voting

01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
voting
 
01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
um against this this time as well
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fellows
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes madam chair i was wondering if
 
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
you can
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
confirm does cosmetology come
 
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
include things like facial peels
 
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
that's aesthetics well
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
but which is also covered by this
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
amendment they're in that same chapter
 
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to say that i've used
 
01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.229 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to say that i've used
over-the-counter

01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
over-the-counter
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
products neutrogena on my face
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
that was supposed to be a moisturizer
 
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:42.470 align:start position:0%
that was supposed to be a moisturizer
and

01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
it caused me to end up with something
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
that looked like a pretty bad
 
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
sunburn and if people are
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
more strong stronger
 
01:13:59.830 --> 01:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
products to do chemical peels i think
 
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
that there's definitely some danger to
 
01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.590 align:start position:0%
that there's definitely some danger to
the

01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:05.669 --> 01:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
public with this because the
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists and
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
as anesthetists are get using
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
procedures that go far beyond just
 
01:14:14.159 --> 01:14:14.950 align:start position:0%
procedures that go far beyond just
haircuts

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
haircuts
 
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
i i agree a haircut is not a big deal
 
01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
but i think some of the other
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
things that they do can be dangerous
 
01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you wrapping up science i just
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
want to declare
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
war on the elderly here representative
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
goal you brought that up i have
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
excellent credentials in that department
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
and i don't i'll take care of myself
 
01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
thanks i thank you representative
 
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
scientific representative strokes
 
01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um first of all
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
there's a whole genre of youtube videos
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
that i fell
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
down the rabbit hole and once all about
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
people doing their own hair
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
and it's pretty funny but some horrible
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
results so if you're ever bored google
 
01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:56.950 align:start position:0%
results so if you're ever bored google
it

01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
on youtube um and you may have heard of
 
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
the gorilla glue incident that was kind
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
of recent
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
but more importantly it is true
 
01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
that and i will say this is
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
a area of uh society that maybe the
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
majority of guys aren't
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
as knowledgeable as we ladies but um
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
you can get mrsa from a pedicure
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
if you have unsterilized hair equipment
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
um you could even pass lice potentially
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
you could uh get a facial that was
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
really trendy a couple years ago
 
01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh that people were doing themselves
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
that was giving uh other people
 
01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.950 align:start position:0%
that was giving uh other people
hepatitis

01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
hepatitis
 
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
so there are a number of health laws
 
01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:44.470 align:start position:0%
so there are a number of health laws
that

01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:46.640 align:start position:0%
that i talked to my beautician and
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
esthetician about
 
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
um and certainly not all of them make
 
01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
the news
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
but uh there is a lot to the license
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
that these uh service providers service
 
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
providers you know what i mean
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
these are beauty um workers
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
do who that are serious
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
and need uh instruction
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
serious chemistry serious health uh
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
understanding and if you've seen the
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
haircuts i've given my husband during
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
covid you would want people to
 
01:16:24.630 --> 01:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
have the license and so for that reason
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
yes uh the reason that we talk about
 
01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:33.990 align:start position:0%
yes uh the reason that we talk about
haircuts

01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
haircuts
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
and clipping a child's fingernails is
 
01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:37.990 align:start position:0%
and clipping a child's fingernails is
because

01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
as much as we would like to separate the
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
issues they
 
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
are lumped in under the same statutes
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
and so i'm not suggesting that someone
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
perform podiatry on somebody right you
 
01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:54.640 align:start position:0%
need a license to be a physician
 
01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
but i am suggesting that lumping
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
somebody in who files their
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
grandmother's toenails down
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
is not the same as putting dangerous
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
chemicals i have to say
 
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
i agree wholeheartedly with
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative fellows who
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
said where does it stop that's
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
exactly the point we've reached now
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
where does it stop
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
and where will it go if i want to lend
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
my friend 50 bucks
 
01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
never my family member a neighbor if i
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
want to lend a neighbor 50 bucks
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
should that put me in violation of
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
banking rules
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
or should i be subject to banking rules
 
01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
what about licensing
 
01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
for food preparation if i want to cook a
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
meal for a stranger never mind a family
 
01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:36.550 align:start position:0%
meal for a stranger never mind a family
member

01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
member
 
01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
or a relative or a friend for a stranger
 
01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
should i be subject to licensing rules
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
what about
 
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
administering medication how many times
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
i know i've done it countless times
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
have you helped a person who wasn't
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
capable of taking their own daily
 
01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:56.070 align:start position:0%
capable of taking their own daily
medication

01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
medication
 
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
to take their medication on a daily
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
basis that's far more dangerous
 
01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
than the chemicals we're talking about
 
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
and again the difference between
 
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
the chemicals available at a hairdresser
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
salon versus in your house
 
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
yeah that also includes the difference
 
01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
between head and shoulders and paul
 
01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:14.310 align:start position:0%
between head and shoulders and paul
mitchell

01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
mitchell
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
right paul mitchell you're getting a
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
hairdresser so yes
 
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
there are occasions i doubt although i
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
haven't been
 
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh none have been reported to me
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
or presented here at this hearing or the
 
01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
other day
 
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
there may be occasions when somebody
 
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
gets uh nits
 
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
or a scalp rash or something like that
 
01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:36.709 align:start position:0%
or a scalp rash or something like that
but

01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
we're still dealing with consenting
 
01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.310 align:start position:0%
we're still dealing with consenting
adults

01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
adults
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
and if i want my friend or a perfect
 
01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.470 align:start position:0%
and if i want my friend or a perfect
stranger

01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
stranger
 
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
to cut my hair the government has no
 
01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:48.630 align:start position:0%
to cut my hair the government has no
place

01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
putting their nose in my personal
 
01:18:51.199 --> 01:18:51.990 align:start position:0%
putting their nose in my personal
private

01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
private
 
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
consenting business and to answer the
 
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
last question
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
where does it stop do we go on to other
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
things i lay down the gauntlet here
 
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative you had a
 
01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.510 align:start position:0%
thank you representative you had a
comment

01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
yes that last i was i was going to say
 
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
something but the person before me
 
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
reinforced it
 
01:19:18.149 --> 01:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
we are if you go back and listen to this
 
01:19:18.159 --> 01:19:19.030 align:start position:0%
we are if you go back and listen to this
testimony

01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
i think you're going to be very
 
01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
surprised at how this has evolved from
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
concerns to safety to government
 
01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:27.669 align:start position:0%
concerns to safety to government
intervention

01:19:27.669 --> 01:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
and that's not what we're here to do we
 
01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
are not here to bring our political
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
agenda or
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
our our personal agenda to this
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me yes yes uh
 
01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
i believe that's approaching an
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
inappropriate comment
 
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
so okay rephrase
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
i'll take it back um we are
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
no longer talking about our constituent
 
01:19:58.950 --> 01:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility or the responsibilities
 
01:19:58.960 --> 01:19:59.350 align:start position:0%
responsibility or the responsibilities
of

01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire and let me
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
say that i've listened
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
after listening to this conversation
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
very few members of this
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
committee understand the difference
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
between professional products
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
and um retail products
 
01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
they understand very little difference
 
01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.590 align:start position:0%
they understand very little difference
between

01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
things that you can do at home and
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
things that you can do in a professional
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
at a professional education please
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
represent allegro is making a point of
 
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
order that you can't tell him what he
 
01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:31.590 align:start position:0%
order that you can't tell him what he
understands

01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
understands
 
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not speaking to him i'm speaking to
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
the community
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
she's speaking of the command yes
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm expressing my opinion very much
 
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
very much like the other members of this
 
01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:45.270 align:start position:0%
very much like the other members of this
committee

01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
and therefore i tell you that
 
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
the purview of this committee we are
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
here brought
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
forth by our constituents to represent
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
them and to do
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
the thing that that we've been doing to
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
protect the people of new hampshire
 
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
and i this conversation does not lend
 
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
credibility to the understanding of this
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
business of this business of cosmetology
 
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm just telling you that i am i
 
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
rarely speak like this i think the
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
people who know me on this committee
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
understand that and i think i have some
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
credibility in this committee
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
as my second term as someone who's very
 
01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.750 align:start position:0%
as my second term as someone who's very
reasonable

01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
and somebody who is willing to listen
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
and talk to people
 
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
and see their side of their of their
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
argument and being collaborative
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
see where we can agree on this
 
01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
if we continue in this direction and i
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
am going to vote against this bill and
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask that we retain it
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
because this is going to be a
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
conversation that we're going to have
 
01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:06.550 align:start position:0%
conversation that we're going to have
continually

01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
continually
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
and i would like to have a mutual
 
01:22:08.719 --> 01:22:09.830 align:start position:0%
and i would like to have a mutual
understanding

01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair which is something that you
 
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
strive for as well
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:20.790 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
goalie

01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i too just
 
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
reiterate some of the things that were
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
said and have been said
 
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
during this exec session that
 
01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
this bill that we've heard numerous
 
01:22:34.159 --> 01:22:34.950 align:start position:0%
this bill that we've heard numerous
times

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
was about individuals giving haircuts to
 
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
their children
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
i think that was the majority of the
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
testimony we used to hear
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
about this bill this bill
 
01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
goes well beyond addressing that issue
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
i have no problem defining a family
 
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
member or something of that nature
 
01:22:59.030 --> 01:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
um if we're gonna do it but this is
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
opening up that whole section of the
 
01:23:01.199 --> 01:23:03.350 align:start position:0%
opening up that whole section of the
statute

01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
to dealing with whether you collect
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
money or not
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
that is the difference of what we're
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
talking about i mean
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
the majority of the testimony was about
 
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
giving haircuts
 
01:23:15.669 --> 01:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
to family members so if we want to
 
01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
address that issue let's address that
 
01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:19.270 align:start position:0%
address that issue let's address that
issue

01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
so i too would be willing to retain it
 
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
so we can actually address the issue
 
01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
that was brought before this committee
 
01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
and we'll still vote against the ought
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.270 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative

yes i just want to uh reiterate the
 
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
point that um and expand on the point
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh schmidt said and that this is a bill
 
01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
in search of a problem it doesn't fix an
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
issue that's happening
 
01:23:47.669 --> 01:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
many of us during cove and i made the
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
joke about my husband's bad hairdos
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
and i am a horrible hair cutter and i'm
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
joked that there's a reason why you need
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
a license for this
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
um but really this would dismantle the
 
01:24:00.239 --> 01:24:01.110 align:start position:0%
um but really this would dismantle the
industry

01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
industry
 
01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
this would dismantle the um
 
01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
licensing of this industry
 
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
go on some of them if they're good at it
 
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
continue to train others and
 
01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
it takes years sometimes for a
 
01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:25.830 align:start position:0%
it takes years sometimes for a
hairdresser

01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
hairdresser
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
or an esthetician to build a client list
 
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
because they have to prove that they're
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
good at it
 
01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
with their continued education with
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
their continued
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
updates from uh their organizations
 
01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
that oversee this profession these
 
01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:44.950 align:start position:0%
that oversee this profession these
professions

01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
professions
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
and uh you know people are still going
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
to be doing
 
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
for as long as we're uh many of us
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
staying at home or self quarantining
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
the covet haircuts none of us have
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
gotten in trouble too many of us have
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
posted the horrible pictures
 
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
on the internet and no one called the
 
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:04.709 align:start position:0%
on the internet and no one called the
police

01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
police
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
on me maybe they should have bad
 
01:25:07.679 --> 01:25:08.550 align:start position:0%
on me maybe they should have bad
haircuts

01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
haircuts
 
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
but seriously the amount of training and
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
the amount
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
of professionalism that this industry
 
01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:16.390 align:start position:0%
of professionalism that this industry
has

01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
in an industry where technically most of
 
01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
the people who do
 
01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
it are contracted to do it so there's
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
essentially in many ways self-employed
 
01:25:26.229 --> 01:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
an issue around businesses
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
that people make a livelihood at and
 
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
this would decimate that
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
this would essentially replace all of
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
that hard work and training
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
and give a lack of confidence to the
 
01:25:44.709 --> 01:25:44.719 align:start position:0%
average granite stater that they're even
 
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
going to someone who knows the basics
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
about which chemicals to mix
 
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
or are your is your equipment
 
01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh that cuts the cuticles on my toes
 
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
gonna give me mrsa
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
which we need to keep this in industry
 
01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:00.390 align:start position:0%
which we need to keep this in industry
intact

01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
intact
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have the sort of barriers and
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
roadblocks that
 
01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
um would actually keep people from doing
 
01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:08.470 align:start position:0%
um would actually keep people from doing
it

01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:10.639 align:start position:0%
for any negative reason it's so that
 
01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%
they have the training and understanding
 
01:26:18.629 --> 01:26:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lackas um just

i mean i i respect all the members of
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
this committee and i appreciate
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
the uh you know collegial
 
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
interaction we've had um but
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
you know i think we are representing our
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
constituents and there are differences
 
01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
of opinion
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
between different people and different
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh areas are different
 
01:26:47.110 --> 01:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
as to the extent to which um government
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
controlling what they're doing to what
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
the extent to which there should be
 
01:26:53.110 --> 01:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
occupational licensing
 
01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
and i don't think it's inappropriate for
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
people to
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh reflect the views of some of their
 
01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:00.390 align:start position:0%
uh reflect the views of some of their
constituents

01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:00.400 align:start position:0%

i've learned a lot i remembered a little
bit

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
bit
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
history of always interested me
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh gave me a chance to delve into human
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
migration i have to be a migrant myself
 
01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
recent times but i learned that the
 
01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:43.030 align:start position:0%
recent times but i learned that the
people

01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
well the humanity originated in africa
 
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
spread out throughout the world and
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
about 14 000 years ago
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
the human population tribes from
 
01:31:57.430 --> 01:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
asia went through eurasia went through
 
01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:58.790 align:start position:0%
asia went through eurasia went through
siberia

01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
siberia
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
bering straits and arrived in america
 
01:32:03.510 --> 01:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
and then obviously it took multiple
 
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
generations for them to travel
 
01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:05.990 align:start position:0%
generations for them to travel
throughout

01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
throughout
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
north america south america they spread
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
out everywhere
 
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
and it took them that long and
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
up until probably a thousand years ago
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
nobody else showed up
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
on this continent and then 500 years ago
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
columbus and then well i'm one of the
 
01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:26.719 align:start position:0%
most recent migrants about 30 years ago
 
01:32:31.030 --> 01:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
so so all these travel stories and
 
01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:31.750 align:start position:0%
so so all these travel stories and
history

01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
history
 
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
fascinated me and i believe that the
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
people who got
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
here first definitely deserve a day the
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
indigenous people they've arrived here
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
again multiple generations they traveled
 
01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
and back in 1994
 
01:32:54.390 --> 01:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
the u.n recognized
 
01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
these well people the migrants the
 
01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
travelers the great travelers that
 
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
got in here and established that august
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
9th should be known as the
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
indigenous people's day and this is why
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
i'm making the motion
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
with this amendment and i believe
 
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
this is what we should do here in the
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
committee thank you
 
01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
thank you representative allegra um i
 
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
says everything that needs to be said
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
and in addition
 
01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh i think it's uh provides a little bit
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
of satisfaction
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
for everyone that might be on uh
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
opposing sides of the uh this debate
 
01:33:32.709 --> 01:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
so that's why a second and support the
 
01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
amendment representative schultz
 
01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
i actually appreciate all the things
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
especially representative yakubovic said
 
01:33:40.719 --> 01:33:41.270 align:start position:0%
especially representative yakubovic said
i

01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
i would love to hear more about your
 
01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:44.310 align:start position:0%
i would love to hear more about your
immigrant

01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
immigrant
 
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
history here in america i think that the
 
01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
u.n doing
 
01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
on indigenous peoples uh
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
holiday or commemoration whatever
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
it is officially called is though a
 
01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:58.229 align:start position:0%
it is officially called is though a
uniquely

01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
uniquely
 
01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
different thing than what
 
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of this bill are trying to
 
01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:05.590 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of this bill are trying to
address

01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
um you know there are still multiple
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
places around the world where
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
there is no representation at the united
 
01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:14.229 align:start position:0%
there is no representation at the united
nations

01:34:14.229 --> 01:34:14.239 align:start position:0%
nations
 
01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
from a variety of matter of fact there's
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
a group called the
 
01:34:20.790 --> 01:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
unrepresented people's organization and
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
i knew some folks that were involved
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
in it um from the kurdish community
 
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
and from uh the palestinian community
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
i think that though that is just not the
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
that the bill authors uh want to
 
01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
address and as well intentioned as the
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
amendment is
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
i would like to suggest that we vote on
 
01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:44.629 align:start position:0%
i would like to suggest that we vote on
the

01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
actual bill itself we've had this bill
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
a number of times now uh especially the
 
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
main sponsor
 
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan has expressed
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
his desire for this not to be amended
 
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
and because it is connected to a
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
specifically american movement
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
and a new hampshire movement that
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
specifically wants to
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
ditch columbus day whether you agree
 
01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
with it or not
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
it is a movement to ditch columbus day
 
01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
for an indigenous people's day
 
01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:17.679 align:start position:0%
specifically for
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire um and the people who were
 
01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:22.229 align:start position:0%
new hampshire um and the people who were
here

01:35:22.229 --> 01:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
as representative yakubovic so
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
eloquently put it
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
you know sure the land the land bridge
 
01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
originally asian
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
eurasian people but uh
 
01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
they were not discovered by columbus who
 
01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
never stepped foot on american soil
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
um nor puerto rican soil etc and
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
the bill authors definitely want
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
the vote and the bill to address this
 
01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:49.270 align:start position:0%
the vote and the bill to address this
specific

01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
issue not because i had suggested
 
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
amendments in the past
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
but the moment that the lead sponsor
 
01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
said no
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
um i don't like your amendment um i
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
withdrew it
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
and i think that it would be a
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
disservice to the intent of this bill
 
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
to not just vote on the intent of the
 
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
bill as it exists
 
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
as written um despite the good
 
01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:15.189 align:start position:0%
as written um despite the good
intentions

01:36:15.189 --> 01:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
intentions
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's all i'm gonna do it's very
 
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
nice of you to say so but
 
01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's not his bill anymore it's our bill
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
and i recommend it
 
01:36:31.990 --> 01:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
and i and i am sure i am not alone
 
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
in having presented a bill that was
 
01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
significantly changed by the committee
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
or the house or the senate
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's one of the risks of of putting
 
01:36:44.709 --> 01:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
forth the bill
 
01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
can be changed uh representative goalie
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
and then thank you madam chair and
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for that bit of advice because
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
i was going to also make that statement
 
01:36:58.950 --> 01:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
that the bill is in our hands now
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
as a committee um but i also want to
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
speak to the amendment
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
um as you know this has come before us
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
numerous times now um and
 
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
was put to a subcommittee to try and
 
01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
come back with
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
a day that they chose um and
 
01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate that there is a world
 
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
recognition world later world
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
recognition of this
 
01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
on august 9th um and
 
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure why uh they are against
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
um having this day uh known as
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
indigenous people's day
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
i i understand if there is an issue with
 
01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
the columbus day recognition then
 
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
change the name of columbus day
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
um and not just to indigenous peoples
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
day when you already
 
01:37:51.590 --> 01:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
are recognized on august 9th
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
so i think with this amendment we are
 
01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
recognizing that day
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
we have a statute a number of days that
 
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
are national days that we recognize as
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
state days
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
such as national teachers day we have
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
that in state statute to recognize that
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
along with national
 
01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
teachers day and i think this goes along
 
01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
with that same precedent that we have
 
01:38:11.199 --> 01:38:12.070 align:start position:0%
with that same precedent that we have
set

01:38:12.070 --> 01:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
set
 
01:38:14.830 --> 01:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
so i will support this thank you
 
01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:16.310 align:start position:0%
so i will support this thank you
representative

01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
there is a national teacher's day or
 
01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
i've never heard of it i've been in the
 
01:38:22.709 --> 01:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
game for about 25 years
 
01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
you are paying attention national
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%

next
 
01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
what i want to say is what i'd like to
 
01:38:33.910 --> 01:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
say is
 
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
i may if i can talk a little bit about
 
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
in general i heard last year when this
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
was discussed
 
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
one representative said that we don't
 
01:38:47.109 --> 01:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
want to be
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
too far out ahead of our populace
 
01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
in the sense that we need to do some
 
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
education about columbus
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
i thought that was a very wise thing i
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
don't know how we go about that by the
 
01:38:58.560 --> 01:38:58.870 align:start position:0%
don't know how we go about that by the
way

01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
but that was pretty it was i thought
 
01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
that pretty
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
interesting good comment i would be in
 
01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:07.669 align:start position:0%
interesting good comment i would be in
favor

01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
favor
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
having been educated now i'm a committee
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
of one here
 
01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
about columbus i just assume get rid of
 
01:39:15.109 --> 01:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
the name
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
entirely i'm not sure i i don't want
 
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
either of them by the way i just assume
 
01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
not have any mention of columbus or
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
indigenous peoples day
 
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
personally because but that takes me
 
01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
down the rabbit hole of debating
 
01:39:32.790 --> 01:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
indigenous peoples i can probably
 
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
support the amendment but i'd like to
 
01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:35.679 align:start position:0%
see it go farther
 
01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
and remove the name of columbus
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
from that day uh i'm not ready to take
 
01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
up the
 
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
the uh man the ramparts for it but
 
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's how i feel
 
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh and that's that okay we're not
 
01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:49.830 align:start position:0%
uh and that's that okay we're not
schmidt

01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
schmidt
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um so i i would
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
like to begin by saying
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
this is a new hampshire bill it's a new
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire issue
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh we have uh indigenous people in this
 
01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:04.870 align:start position:0%
uh we have uh indigenous people in this
state

01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:40:07.669 --> 01:40:07.679 align:start position:0%
who are descendants of of people who
 
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
have been here
 
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
for 13 or 14 000 years by the scientific
 
01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:14.149 align:start position:0%
for 13 or 14 000 years by the scientific
reckonings

01:40:14.149 --> 01:40:14.159 align:start position:0%
reckonings
 
01:40:17.590 --> 01:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
um and they were never driven out like
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
some tribes were
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
in this southern part of the the east
 
01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:23.030 align:start position:0%
in this southern part of the the east
coast

01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
coast
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
the so-called trail of tears the story
 
01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
comes to mind
 
01:40:29.669 --> 01:40:29.679 align:start position:0%
um but the abunaki and the other
 
01:40:29.679 --> 01:40:30.390 align:start position:0%
um but the abunaki and the other
indigenous

01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
indigenous
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
people of this area and their
 
01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
descendants are still here
 
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
they weren't driven out they've never
 
01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
gone there they were here then
 
01:40:41.109 --> 01:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
they're still here and for those people
 
01:40:45.109 --> 01:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
columbus day is a an annual slap in the
 
01:40:45.119 --> 01:40:46.470 align:start position:0%
columbus day is a an annual slap in the
face

01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
face
 
01:40:49.590 --> 01:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
and it's a slap in the face uh
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
really in many respects of italians as
 
01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:53.109 align:start position:0%
really in many respects of italians as
well

01:40:53.109 --> 01:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
colum christopher columbus is not an
 
01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:56.870 align:start position:0%
colum christopher columbus is not an
exemplar

01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
exemplar
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
of italian culture he is not somebody
 
01:41:01.590 --> 01:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
who should be celebrated
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
if there was a lack of understanding at
 
01:41:04.709 --> 01:41:04.719 align:start position:0%
one point
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
of his true history
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
could you continue to speak about the
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
amendment rather than about columbus day
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
well uh the amendment doesn't go
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
in the direction we need to go it it
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's a step in the right direction
 
01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
but the indigenous people
 
01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh who are here they are capable of
 
01:41:27.679 --> 01:41:28.709 align:start position:0%
uh who are here they are capable of
celebrating

01:41:28.709 --> 01:41:28.719 align:start position:0%
celebrating
 
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
their own existence uh on their own they
 
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
don't need our help
 
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's columbus day which is an annual
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
slap in the face so i will not be
 
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
supporting the amendment
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't go where where we
 
01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
need to go which is to get
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
rid of christopher columbus celebration
 
01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
italian culture italian culture is
 
01:41:51.199 --> 01:41:53.270 align:start position:0%
italian culture italian culture is
wonderful

01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
that's where we that that's where we
 
01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
needed to
 
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
also come down a celebration of italian
 
01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
culture is not accomplished by
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i'm
 
01:42:17.109 --> 01:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
all for having recognition of indigenous
 
01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
people's day
 
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
but i don't um think it belongs
 
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
with the holidays i looked in the
 
01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:24.629 align:start position:0%
with the holidays i looked in the
statutes

01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
to see if i could find some kind of
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
definition that shows me the distinction
 
01:42:28.639 --> 01:42:29.590 align:start position:0%
definition that shows me the distinction
between

01:42:29.590 --> 01:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
making something a holiday and putting
 
01:42:33.669 --> 01:42:33.679 align:start position:0%
it in the proclamation
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
list so i i think that
 
01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
um i'd be happy to see indigenous people
 
01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
say in a proclamation
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to see christopher columbus
 
01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:44.390 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to see christopher columbus
day

01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:42:47.669 --> 01:42:47.679 align:start position:0%
be taken out of the holidays i'd be
 
01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:48.639 align:start position:0%
happy to see
 
01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
an italian recognition
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
day in the with the proclamations
 
01:42:58.229 --> 01:42:58.239 align:start position:0%
but adding um this to
 
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
the holidays i think makes me
 
01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
concerned that in the future all of
 
01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:04.550 align:start position:0%
concerned that in the future all of
these

01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
proclamation bills that that we received
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
will start showing up is um
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a valid concern
 
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
always a second writer just like this
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
you have a quick question you know
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
being new to edna if what is the
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
technical difference or the implications
 
01:43:32.709 --> 01:43:32.719 align:start position:0%
of something being a holiday versus a
 
01:43:32.719 --> 01:43:36.709 align:start position:0%
of something being a holiday versus a
proclamation

01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:40.950 --> 01:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
a holiday is frequent is is frequently
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
a day off from work which is an issue in
 
01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
of cost columbus day happens to be a
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
federal holiday but so
 
01:43:52.149 --> 01:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
i'm what i'm wondering is with this this
 
01:43:53.350 --> 01:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
bill has a holiday
 
01:43:55.109 --> 01:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
but it's not on the same day as columbus
 
01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
day it's a new day so i mean would this
 
01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
actually cause it to be a day off of
 
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
work or would that have to be
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
explicit that would have to be explicit
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
we had it explicitly one one year i
 
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
remember that
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:16.719 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair uh i think at
 
01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
this particular time
 
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
enough has been said in our past thank
 
01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:21.679 align:start position:0%
you so much for recognizing me
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you represent scitec i just want
 
01:44:25.590 --> 01:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
the record
 
01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
or to the history to note this is about
 
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
as close as i've ever gotten
 
01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:36.550 --> 01:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
let's just say yes representative roy
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
if we were debating uh not the amendment
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
the bill i i would um
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
actually support a world or a human
 
01:44:45.669 --> 01:44:45.679 align:start position:0%
exploration day in the place of columbus
 
01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
because in my mind
 
01:44:48.390 --> 01:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
that's what that was about um
 
01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
exploration and
 
01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
the need for us to go beyond the next
 
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
horizon so
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
to me it's not really about a man or a
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
day it's about
 
01:44:58.550 --> 01:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
the whole thing we should be celebrating
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
is exploration
 
01:45:01.590 --> 01:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
um but since we're talking about the
 
01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
all right everyone else
 
01:45:10.870 --> 01:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you the motion is to adopt
 
01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:12.270 align:start position:0%

and roy do you wish to speak to your

i congratulate all right
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
i i would like to comment that i think
 
01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative roy's
 
01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
point is very well taken because
 
01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
regardless of what we might think of
 
01:47:18.239 --> 01:47:19.510 align:start position:0%
regardless of what we might think of
columbus

01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
columbus
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
as a person he did accomplish
 
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
connecting the hemispheres and that
 
01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
changed the world forever
 
01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
and i think that is something that we
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
should be noting anyone else have a
 
01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:35.590 align:start position:0%
should be noting anyone else have a
comment

01:47:35.590 --> 01:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
question represent a site i'd still like
 
01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
to see columbus ditched
 
01:47:43.510 --> 01:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
but i'm not quick
 
01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
one step at a time one step at a time
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
represent allegro
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
we never thought of this as an italian
 
01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
celebration you might notice by the
 
01:47:51.750 --> 01:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
battle at the end of my name that i
 
01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:53.669 align:start position:0%
battle at the end of my name that i
qualify

01:47:53.669 --> 01:47:53.679 align:start position:0%
qualify
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
and we were never taught in school that
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
columbus uh
 
01:47:59.270 --> 01:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
was a great man we were taught that he
 
01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
was a great explorer
 
01:48:04.709 --> 01:48:04.719 align:start position:0%
and uh fact remains two facts remain one
 
01:48:05.590 --> 01:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh his exploration changed the course of
 
01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
human history
 
01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
and b whether or not he was brutal he
 
01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
only reflected
 
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
humankind in general because there was
 
01:48:17.590 --> 01:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
savagery and slavery and
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
brutality uh performed by nations and
 
01:48:22.470 --> 01:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
tribes on every continent
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
on the planet so i don't celebrate
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
christopher columbus
 
01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
for being a great man in fact i don't
 
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
celebrate it at all i just acknowledge
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
that day is designated to recognize
 
01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
a great explorer and that's what
 
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
christopher columbus was
 
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
the other thing of course is that
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
columbus day in new hampshire
 
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
is the official end of the summer
 
01:48:47.510 --> 01:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
tourist season
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
and that's when the granite state
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
ambassadors switch from khaki pants to
 
01:48:55.430 --> 01:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:57.350 --> 01:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
tech real quick representative allegro
 
01:48:58.470 --> 01:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
he was even
 
01:49:01.590 --> 01:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
beyond the man of the times i mean
 
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
we had civilization actually was
 
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
occurring and he was just
 
01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
beyond man that's not necessary i i
 
01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:09.750 align:start position:0%
beyond man that's not necessary i i
think

01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
that there are multiple historical
 
01:49:11.679 --> 01:49:12.790 align:start position:0%
that there are multiple historical
accounts

01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
and that one has become very popular and
 
01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
in vogue lately
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's greatly mistaken right
 
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay all right representative
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair thank you i i just
 
01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:28.639 align:start position:0%
wanted to say if
 
01:49:31.030 --> 01:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative scitec wants to produce
 
01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
that bill next session
 
01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
i will co-sponsor it with him all right
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
representative schultz okay
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
there's all this discussion about
 
01:49:42.149 --> 01:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
columbus but at this point
 
01:49:44.229 --> 01:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
is there any reference to columbus at
 
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
all but given how the amendment is
 
01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's only that he columbus day remains
 
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
unchanged in the statutes that is being
 
01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:55.270 align:start position:0%
unchanged in the statutes that is being
amended

01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
amended
 
01:49:57.350 --> 01:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
because it's confusing that that
 
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
actually is a part of the wording
 
01:50:02.790 --> 01:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
um part of a what it didn't change the
 
01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:03.189 align:start position:0%
um part of a what it didn't change the
title

01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
title

i moved um house bill 544 ought to pass
 
01:53:52.830 --> 01:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:52.840 --> 01:54:06.870 align:start position:0%
 
amendments

01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you okay we are ready to discuss
 
01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:11.350 align:start position:0%
thank you okay we are ready to discuss
this

01:54:11.350 --> 01:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
so when i first saw this
 
01:54:21.669 --> 01:54:21.679 align:start position:0%
i didn't really understand what it was
 
01:54:21.679 --> 01:54:23.350 align:start position:0%
i didn't really understand what it was
about

01:54:23.350 --> 01:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
and i had to do some research and what i
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
did i was
 
01:54:28.709 --> 01:54:28.719 align:start position:0%
i was really disturbed to find out what
 
01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
was being taught
 
01:54:34.870 --> 01:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
some children and workplaces
 
01:54:38.310 --> 01:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
that this concept of this critical race
 
01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:39.669 align:start position:0%
that this concept of this critical race
theory

01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
theory
 
01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
that um that we're making some people
 
01:54:43.589 --> 01:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
apologize to
 
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
other people based on the color of their
 
01:54:47.589 --> 01:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
skin and i found that
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
i found that deeply disturbing helping
 
01:54:54.070 --> 01:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
um and i've heard some people
 
01:54:56.310 --> 01:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
push back emails and you know this is
 
01:54:57.589 --> 01:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
about free speech
 
01:54:59.910 --> 01:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
the funny thing about free speech is
 
01:55:01.109 --> 01:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
while you're free to say
 
01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
what you want you're also free to walk
 
01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
away and not listen to it
 
01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
and this big targets people who aren't
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
free to walk away and not listen to it
 
01:55:12.629 --> 01:55:12.639 align:start position:0%
this is compelled compelled listening
 
01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
now is should critical race theory
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
be able to be discussed absolutely um
 
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
but you should also have the right to
 
01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:20.229 align:start position:0%
but you should also have the right to
not

01:55:20.229 --> 01:55:20.239 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:55:23.669 --> 01:55:23.679 align:start position:0%
have to listen to it or or walk away
 
01:55:24.149 --> 01:55:24.159 align:start position:0%
from it
 
01:55:26.070 --> 01:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
and what we have is we have people that
 
01:55:27.990 --> 01:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
are in schools or in
 
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
places that are threatened terminated if
 
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
01:55:36.390 --> 01:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
listen um it is in fact a theory
 
01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
um it's not something that's proven
 
01:55:42.070 --> 01:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
um and i just i found the whole concept
 
01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
to be disturbing
 
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
um in the least that people being made
 
01:55:48.550 --> 01:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
to do or that children are being able to
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
stand up in front of a class and
 
01:55:52.709 --> 01:55:52.719 align:start position:0%
apologize for their whiteness
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
um i i just it's antithetical to
 
01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
everything that i've ever been taught
 
01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:57.189 align:start position:0%
everything that i've ever been taught
about

01:55:57.189 --> 01:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:56:01.030 --> 01:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
treating people equally um but again
 
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
i respect the right to have that thought
 
01:56:05.109 --> 01:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
and if people want to think
 
01:56:08.310 --> 01:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
tell each other it and even teach it so
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
long as
 
01:56:10.709 --> 01:56:10.719 align:start position:0%
it's not mandatory that people have to
 
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
listen to it so based on that i think
 
01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
that it's appropriate that we passed
 
01:56:14.950 --> 01:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:56:18.790 --> 01:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
and been mandatory teaching this
 
01:56:22.070 --> 01:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
concept thank you okay
 
01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:25.430 align:start position:0%
concept thank you okay
representation

01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:28.149 --> 01:56:28.159 align:start position:0%
thank you just a question of the chair i
 
01:56:28.159 --> 01:56:29.910 align:start position:0%
thank you just a question of the chair i
suppose

01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
suppose
 
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
i'm curious and i apologize if i
 
01:56:38.229 --> 01:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
did did we get an update
 
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
on the sign-ins that have occurred
 
01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
since we started acting on this bill
 
01:56:47.669 --> 01:56:47.679 align:start position:0%
if it was in the email i missed it the
 
01:56:47.679 --> 01:56:49.910 align:start position:0%
if it was in the email i missed it the
sign-ins

01:56:55.589 --> 01:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
of the day of the hearing the additional
 
01:56:58.070 --> 01:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
emails we have all received are up to us
 
01:57:01.270 --> 01:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
to interpret and count all right so the
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
account that i had on that days
 
01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
is what was on the sign in that's that
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
was people that signed in specifically
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
other people have chosen to send us
 
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
their their thoughts
 
01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
right thank you and i at my count is
 
01:57:19.030 --> 01:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:57:29.589 --> 01:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair well
 
01:57:35.510 --> 01:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
one looks at the language of the bill
 
01:57:36.790 --> 01:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
and as i said to
 
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
the the prime sponsor representative
 
01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:40.390 align:start position:0%
the the prime sponsor representative
amman

01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
amman
 
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
the statements that are made in the bill
 
01:57:46.390 --> 01:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
are indisputable that no one is better
 
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
or worse
 
01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
than anyone else because of his or her
 
01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:50.550 align:start position:0%
than anyone else because of his or her
age

01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
age
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
sex race religious belief or whatever
 
01:57:58.870 --> 01:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
but the problem is not the the language
 
01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
the problem is that the bill itself is
 
01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
fundamentally uh not workable
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
uh and antithetical to uh
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
the structure that we currently have in
 
01:58:19.510 --> 01:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire in that
 
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
school instruction public school
 
01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:23.270 align:start position:0%
school instruction public school
instruction

01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
is in the hands of the
 
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
school districts and the school boards
 
01:58:33.030 --> 01:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
of those districts throughout the state
 
01:58:33.750 --> 01:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:58:37.030 --> 01:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
local control issue so
 
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
what is being taught in the state of new
 
01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire or not being taught in the
 
01:58:41.669 --> 01:58:41.679 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
is a local control issue and
 
01:58:49.270 --> 01:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
in point of fact the the alleged thrust
 
01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
is very broad it's overly broad and
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
unworkable because
 
01:58:59.669 --> 01:58:59.679 align:start position:0%
it not only uh would
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
prohibit the teaching of critical race
 
01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:03.350 align:start position:0%
prohibit the teaching of critical race
theory

01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
theory
 
01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh although it doesn't name critical
 
01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
race theory but
 
01:59:09.189 --> 01:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
all the proponents or virtually all the
 
01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
proponents of the bill
 
01:59:13.350 --> 01:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
have focused on critical race theory
 
01:59:15.030 --> 01:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
which may or may not be an
 
01:59:18.149 --> 01:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
odious uh and a
 
01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
hostile racist concept
 
01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not willing to devote a lot of my
 
01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:24.310 align:start position:0%
i'm not willing to devote a lot of my
time

01:59:24.310 --> 01:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
into determining what it is the bottom
 
01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
line is
 
01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
that the bill goes too far because it
 
01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:33.350 align:start position:0%
that the bill goes too far because it
would

01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:59:37.189 --> 01:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
in the in the testimony of the aclu
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
it is unconstitutional and if you look
 
01:59:41.910 --> 01:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
into it you see that
 
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
the executive order on which it is
 
01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:45.189 align:start position:0%
the executive order on which it is
almost

01:59:45.189 --> 01:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
almost
 
01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:48.610 align:start position:0%
word for word pattern was struck down
 
01:59:48.610 --> 01:59:49.910 align:start position:0%
word for word pattern was struck down
[Music]

01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:59:52.709 --> 01:59:52.719 align:start position:0%
just a few months after former president
 
01:59:52.719 --> 01:59:53.750 align:start position:0%
just a few months after former president
trump

01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
trump
 
01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
issued the executive order so the bill
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
if it were passed
 
02:00:00.870 --> 02:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
it would almost certainly be immediately
 
02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:01.910 align:start position:0%
it would almost certainly be immediately
enjoined

02:00:01.910 --> 02:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
enjoined
 
02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
and likely struck down as being too
 
02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:05.030 align:start position:0%
and likely struck down as being too
vague

02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
vague
 
02:00:08.870 --> 02:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
overly broad and so forth and so on so
 
02:00:12.149 --> 02:00:12.159 align:start position:0%
the problem is that no one
 
02:00:14.229 --> 02:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
denies or very few people would deny
 
02:00:15.750 --> 02:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
that we still have
 
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
problems with discrimination in this
 
02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:18.790 align:start position:0%
problems with discrimination in this
state

02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:00:21.189 --> 02:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
as well as in the nation we still have
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
problems with
 
02:00:25.990 --> 02:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
racism ageism sexism and so forth
 
02:00:29.430 --> 02:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
um so the fact that the bill
 
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
i know prohibits uh
 
02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
discussion of those issues but the
 
02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
problem is it goes too far
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
and would not uh
 
02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
be acceptable under our constitution
 
02:00:46.709 --> 02:00:46.719 align:start position:0%
in my opinion and the testimony that we
 
02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
heard and we heard
 
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
that from the from the new hampshire uh
 
02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
school as a
 
02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
school administrators association in
 
02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.510 align:start position:0%
school administrators association in
opposition

02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh i've already talked about the fact
 
02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
that it's a local issue
 
02:01:07.109 --> 02:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
but above and beyond that and more
 
02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
importantly is
 
02:01:11.270 --> 02:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
critical race theory and i've checked
 
02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
into this critical race theory
 
02:01:15.189 --> 02:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
is not being taught in the state of new
 
02:01:15.199 --> 02:01:16.790 align:start position:0%
is not being taught in the state of new
hampshire

02:01:16.790 --> 02:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:01:20.070 --> 02:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
certainly is not being taught at the
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
at the elementary school level and the
 
02:01:23.830 --> 02:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
courses that are taught
 
02:01:27.669 --> 02:01:27.679 align:start position:0%
are very often not only well-intentioned
 
02:01:29.589 --> 02:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
but well-designed courses
 
02:01:32.709 --> 02:01:32.719 align:start position:0%
to deal with the issues of slavery
 
02:01:36.149 --> 02:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
racism sexism ageism and so forth
 
02:01:39.030 --> 02:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
and they likely would also come into
 
02:01:40.870 --> 02:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
conflict with this statute
 
02:01:44.310 --> 02:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
if it were adopted and enacted so the
 
02:01:47.189 --> 02:01:47.199 align:start position:0%
the bill is simply not a good idea it's
 
02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
too broad
 
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
it engages issues that it doesn't intend
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
to engage
 
02:01:55.750 --> 02:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh and what we should do especially
 
02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:56.470 align:start position:0%
uh and what we should do especially
since

02:01:56.470 --> 02:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
since
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh critical race theory is not really uh
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
widespread in new hampshire if it's if
 
02:02:04.149 --> 02:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
it's being used
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
at all what we should be doing with this
 
02:02:09.189 --> 02:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
bill is retaining it
 
02:02:12.709 --> 02:02:12.719 align:start position:0%
and looking at the issue because unlike
 
02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
the pandemic which started in
 
02:02:19.109 --> 02:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
apparently in china and there
 
02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
then very swiftly got to our shores both
 
02:02:23.830 --> 02:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
east and west coast
 
02:02:27.189 --> 02:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
and have spread everywhere
 
02:02:29.669 --> 02:02:29.679 align:start position:0%
this is not something that's like a
 
02:02:29.679 --> 02:02:30.870 align:start position:0%
this is not something that's like a
pandemic

02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:02:33.189 --> 02:02:33.199 align:start position:0%
this is something which is clearly a
 
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
matter of choice
 
02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
and whatever state one may
 
02:02:43.030 --> 02:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
encounter crt critical race theory
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
it's not an issue in new hampshire nor
 
02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
is it inevitable
 
02:02:48.709 --> 02:02:48.719 align:start position:0%
and in point of fact our schools are
 
02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
dealing with the real issues
 
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
the issues of racism and sexism and so
 
02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:55.189 align:start position:0%
the issues of racism and sexism and so
forth

02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
forth
 
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
um and critical race theory is not
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
being promulgated being taught or
 
02:03:04.390 --> 02:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
being is you know spread around the
 
02:03:05.589 --> 02:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
02:03:08.709 --> 02:03:08.719 align:start position:0%
there's no urgency about getting this in
 
02:03:10.390 --> 02:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
to stop this evil
 
02:03:14.310 --> 02:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
practice from from from contaminating
 
02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
our state
 
02:03:18.790 --> 02:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
it's not here and there's no
 
02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
likelihood given my discussions with
 
02:03:21.990 --> 02:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
school authorities
 
02:03:24.390 --> 02:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
that it will that it will be adopted in
 
02:03:25.830 --> 02:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
our local schools
 
02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
whatsoever because it is very
 
02:03:31.830 --> 02:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
controversial at the very least and
 
02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:33.750 align:start position:0%
controversial at the very least and
counterproductive

02:03:33.750 --> 02:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
counterproductive
 
02:03:37.189 --> 02:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
based on the research i've done so
 
02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
we are again in search of
 
02:03:44.229 --> 02:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
of a unless of a problem with this
 
02:03:44.239 --> 02:03:45.669 align:start position:0%
of a unless of a problem with this
solution

02:03:45.669 --> 02:03:45.679 align:start position:0%
solution
 
02:03:47.589 --> 02:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
which is not workable and it's almost
 
02:03:49.030 --> 02:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
certain to be enjoined
 
02:03:50.950 --> 02:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
if it ever gets through the senate and
 
02:03:52.709 --> 02:03:52.719 align:start position:0%
or gets signed by the governor
 
02:03:55.669 --> 02:03:55.679 align:start position:0%
which i strongly doubt thank you
 
02:03:57.030 --> 02:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
just for the record indicate that the
 
02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
the bill does not
 
02:04:03.990 --> 02:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
prohibit discussion of race racism or
 
02:04:05.589 --> 02:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
anything of the sort that
 
02:04:07.510 --> 02:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
prohibits the things outlined in
 
02:04:08.950 --> 02:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
critical race theory
 
02:04:11.910 --> 02:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
um representative allegro yeah i would
 
02:04:14.470 --> 02:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
like to point out that
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
the title of this bill is divisive
 
02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:19.189 align:start position:0%
the title of this bill is divisive
concepts

02:04:19.189 --> 02:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
concepts
 
02:04:21.030 --> 02:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
in fact the term critical race theory is
 
02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
not even mentioned in it so
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
arguing that critical race theory is not
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
02:04:29.189 --> 02:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
um really is not germane so what is
 
02:04:30.310 --> 02:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
germain to this bill
 
02:04:33.270 --> 02:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
is racism uh which i and i hope
 
02:04:34.229 --> 02:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
everybody here
 
02:04:37.270 --> 02:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:39.990 --> 02:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
i've looked online to pick up the oxford
 
02:04:42.069 --> 02:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
american webster definition
 
02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
of racism words and definitions do still
 
02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:46.390 align:start position:0%
of racism words and definitions do still
have

02:04:46.390 --> 02:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
meaning and weight it says prejudice and
 
02:04:50.550 --> 02:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
of shortening is prejudice
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
discrimination or antagonism against
 
02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
a person or people on the basis of their
 
02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
membership in a particular
 
02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
official or a group well that is exactly
 
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
what and i don't use critical risk areas
 
02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
but i mean all of its uh allied
 
02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:08.149 align:start position:0%
but i mean all of its uh allied
hypotheses

02:05:08.149 --> 02:05:08.159 align:start position:0%
hypotheses
 
02:05:11.350 --> 02:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what they teach they
 
02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
to use street jargon it keeps
 
02:05:19.109 --> 02:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
misbehavior of all of humankind
 
02:05:25.990 --> 02:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
on the backs of one race uh
 
02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
one group and that's uh
 
02:05:31.109 --> 02:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
principally white men of european
 
02:05:31.119 --> 02:05:33.589 align:start position:0%
principally white men of european
descent

02:05:33.589 --> 02:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
descent
 
02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
by definition that is racism
 
02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
i hope that uh the whole committee will
 
02:05:42.149 --> 02:05:42.159 align:start position:0%
join me in a hoarding racism
 
02:05:45.510 --> 02:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
and by the way um this is not
 
02:05:49.109 --> 02:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
a an issue of uh uh first
 
02:05:53.030 --> 02:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
segment uh restriction of free violation
 
02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh we live in our dead eyes now
 
02:06:00.229 --> 02:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
with restrictions on our first amendment
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
in all sorts of venues
 
02:06:06.390 --> 02:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
for instance and in all of our behaviors
 
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
we are not allowed
 
02:06:11.350 --> 02:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
to express racism in equal opportunity
 
02:06:14.870 --> 02:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
institutions most required by law
 
02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
or in housing or in curriculum
 
02:06:21.189 --> 02:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that if our school curriculum
 
02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
taught that
 
02:06:26.310 --> 02:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
all african americans are
 
02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
to blame for some particular ill in
 
02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:30.310 align:start position:0%
to blame for some particular ill in
society

02:06:30.310 --> 02:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
society
 
02:06:31.750 --> 02:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
that there would be little to no
 
02:06:33.589 --> 02:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
objection but that's
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
actually the way it is now uh you will
 
02:06:36.790 --> 02:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
have your money
 
02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
sucked out belong to you by the state
 
02:06:39.990 --> 02:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
02:06:42.830 --> 02:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
if you attempted to propose that
 
02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:44.069 align:start position:0%
if you attempted to propose that
hypothesis

02:06:44.069 --> 02:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
hypothesis
 
02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
white black yellow right
 
02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
no one's teaching our children they are
 
02:06:53.669 --> 02:06:53.679 align:start position:0%
as we've heard testimony they are
 
02:06:56.069 --> 02:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
teaching our children
 
02:06:59.270 --> 02:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh that white people are shameful
 
02:07:01.830 --> 02:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
racist bigots and that they're the only
 
02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:02.470 align:start position:0%
racist bigots and that they're the only
one

02:07:02.470 --> 02:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:07:04.229 --> 02:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
and it's just wrong no matter what color
 
02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
you are i
 
02:07:07.830 --> 02:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
i believe in martin luther great
 
02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:09.669 align:start position:0%
i believe in martin luther great
statements

02:07:09.669 --> 02:07:09.679 align:start position:0%
statements
 
02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:16.709 --> 02:07:16.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i i go along with
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt's comments um i
 
02:07:22.470 --> 02:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
won't go on long uh but i just do want
 
02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:22.950 align:start position:0%
won't go on long uh but i just do want
to

02:07:22.950 --> 02:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:07:27.430 --> 02:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:29.910 --> 02:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill that still i think we heard
 
02:07:31.109 --> 02:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
in testimony
 
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
could be or is unconstitutional by
 
02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:34.629 align:start position:0%
could be or is unconstitutional by
requiring

02:07:34.629 --> 02:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
02:07:37.910 --> 02:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh contractors with states telling them
 
02:07:39.430 --> 02:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
what they can and cannot
 
02:07:42.550 --> 02:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
do uh with their employees and with
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
their own private dollars
 
02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
um and i i for that reason i cannot
 
02:07:49.189 --> 02:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
02:07:51.990 --> 02:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
um i i think we had strong testimony on
 
02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:52.709 align:start position:0%
um i i think we had strong testimony on
that

02:07:52.709 --> 02:07:52.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
and with that still in the bill there is
 
02:07:56.390 --> 02:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
02:07:57.990 --> 02:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
and like representative schmidt i think
 
02:08:00.069 --> 02:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
it will be ruled unconstitutional
 
02:08:03.189 --> 02:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh
 
02:08:07.270 --> 02:08:07.280 align:start position:0%

uh hb 544
 
02:08:26.390 --> 02:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
this bill is an attack
 
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
on first amendment rights attack
 
02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:31.270 align:start position:0%
on first amendment rights attack
directly

02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
directly
 
02:08:34.830 --> 02:08:34.840 align:start position:0%

02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:36.950 align:start position:0%
a category of people after all bad
souvenirs

souvenirs
 
02:08:40.550 --> 02:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
right now we need a healing bill
 
02:08:44.069 --> 02:08:44.079 align:start position:0%
not a divided one like this
 
02:08:47.589 --> 02:08:47.599 align:start position:0%
actually new hampshire has a diversity
 
02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
population i am one of them
 
02:08:57.189 --> 02:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:05.189 --> 02:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
who does not have a voice
 
02:09:10.149 --> 02:09:10.159 align:start position:0%

to oppose this racist bill
 
02:09:29.669 --> 02:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
the passage of this bill will detract
 
02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
not contribute we need to go forward
 
02:09:38.229 --> 02:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
not backward i remember
 
02:09:42.149 --> 02:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
two years ago uh
 
02:09:46.550 --> 02:09:46.560 align:start position:0%

02:11:15.189 --> 02:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
we try to divide uh human beings
 
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
but god asked us
 
02:11:21.750 --> 02:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
the creator he asked us to
 
02:11:37.750 --> 02:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
is the worst crime
 
02:11:45.109 --> 02:11:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:47.910 --> 02:11:47.920 align:start position:0%

for some white people i don't say all
 
02:16:02.950 --> 02:16:02.960 align:start position:0%

the republic
 
02:17:17.589 --> 02:17:17.599 align:start position:0%
for which we spend one nation
 
02:17:21.270 --> 02:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
under god indivisible with liberty
 
02:17:24.549 --> 02:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
and justice for all not justice for some
 
02:17:29.910 --> 02:17:29.920 align:start position:0%

thank you representative judy just for
 
02:17:34.230 --> 02:17:34.240 align:start position:0%

02:17:40.790 --> 02:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:44.389 --> 02:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
representative scitec um
 
02:17:46.389 --> 02:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
no one can disagree with anything that
 
02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
representative judy has said
 
02:17:51.110 --> 02:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
i wanted to speak more to the bill and
 
02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:51.830 align:start position:0%
i wanted to speak more to the bill and
uh

02:17:51.830 --> 02:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:53.990 --> 02:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative goalie i understand about
 
02:17:56.469 --> 02:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
the contractors i'm looking at this from
 
02:17:58.309 --> 02:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
the prism of the teacher who wants to be
 
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
appreciated i guess
 
02:18:04.309 --> 02:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
and that's for me this bill is symbolic
 
02:18:07.429 --> 02:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
uh it sends a signal that the classroom
 
02:18:09.349 --> 02:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
is for teaching anything you want to
 
02:18:11.910 --> 02:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
teach but it is the classroom
 
02:18:15.270 --> 02:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
is not for indoctrination um
 
02:18:18.629 --> 02:18:18.639 align:start position:0%
and i don't see this i see this being
 
02:18:21.429 --> 02:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
law if it were a law being invoked any
 
02:18:21.439 --> 02:18:22.070 align:start position:0%
law if it were a law being invoked any
more

02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:18:25.349 --> 02:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
than a father being indicted for cutting
 
02:18:26.950 --> 02:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
his son's hair
 
02:18:29.349 --> 02:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
so that's all i have to say
 
02:18:33.990 --> 02:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:38.469 --> 02:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
okay i actually written my remarks down
 
02:18:41.509 --> 02:18:41.519 align:start position:0%
which i so rarely do
 
02:18:43.509 --> 02:18:43.519 align:start position:0%
and i've also chosen my words very
 
02:18:45.509 --> 02:18:45.519 align:start position:0%
carefully i want to be clear i'm not
 
02:18:48.469 --> 02:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
disparaging anyone personally in what
 
02:18:49.669 --> 02:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
i'm about to say
 
02:18:53.110 --> 02:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
i'm focusing on the content of the bill
 
02:18:56.070 --> 02:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is an awful product of the
 
02:18:57.750 --> 02:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
race-baiting dog whistle
 
02:19:00.629 --> 02:19:00.639 align:start position:0%
politics of the trump era and the fake
 
02:19:03.429 --> 02:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
battle against cancel culture
 
02:19:06.150 --> 02:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
but this isn't just some cut and paste
 
02:19:08.309 --> 02:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
of an executive order
 
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
this actually signals an embrace of
 
02:19:12.150 --> 02:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
trump's bigoted
 
02:19:16.389 --> 02:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:19.349 --> 02:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
i am afraid that is a bit inflammatory
 
02:19:21.110 --> 02:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
and since it is not a copy of the
 
02:19:22.389 --> 02:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
executive order
 
02:19:26.070 --> 02:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
it is a separate bill please
 
02:19:29.509 --> 02:19:29.519 align:start position:0%
tone down your remarks well i want to be
 
02:19:31.190 --> 02:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
able to address
 
02:19:33.669 --> 02:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
the specifics of the bill because i
 
02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
don't think he was attacking don't
 
02:19:41.110 --> 02:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
mention don't mention ex president trump
 
02:19:44.070 --> 02:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
um well that's hard because that's where
 
02:19:46.309 --> 02:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
this movement has come from but let me
 
02:19:50.870 --> 02:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:53.030 --> 02:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
i think that's my only other mention of
 
02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:54.389 align:start position:0%
i think that's my only other mention of
him

02:19:54.389 --> 02:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
him
 
02:19:59.910 --> 02:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
um i will say
 
02:20:02.469 --> 02:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
there has been a rise not specifying
 
02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
when or who
 
02:20:07.270 --> 02:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
of anti-semitism sexism homophobia
 
02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
and white supremacy in the common
 
02:20:10.080 --> 02:20:11.750 align:start position:0%
and white supremacy in the common
discourse

02:20:11.750 --> 02:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
discourse
 
02:20:15.190 --> 02:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
um i suspect most of us know
 
02:20:17.190 --> 02:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
that were this bill to be signed by the
 
02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
governor it will be declared
 
02:20:19.080 --> 02:20:20.710 align:start position:0%
governor it will be declared
unconstitutional

02:20:20.710 --> 02:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
02:20:23.830 --> 02:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
i suspect most of us know this bill will
 
02:20:25.590 --> 02:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
never become law
 
02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
so why do it at all is it really worth
 
02:20:30.469 --> 02:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
it to throw red meat
 
02:20:32.389 --> 02:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
in an albeit large segment of
 
02:20:32.399 --> 02:20:34.150 align:start position:0%
in an albeit large segment of
republicans

02:20:34.150 --> 02:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
republicans
 
02:20:37.030 --> 02:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
to take the side of a small segment of
 
02:20:39.750 --> 02:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
ultra conservative activists
 
02:20:42.070 --> 02:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
over the inherent bias training that is
 
02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:42.790 align:start position:0%
over the inherent bias training that is
so

02:20:42.790 --> 02:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:20:46.230 --> 02:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
mainstream it is laughable to put
 
02:20:49.270 --> 02:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
a fake battle over cancel culture ahead
 
02:20:50.950 --> 02:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
of the urgent need to face
 
02:20:54.469 --> 02:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
racism head on with an honest albeit
 
02:20:56.270 --> 02:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
often awkward
 
02:20:58.790 --> 02:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
society-wide conversation about our
 
02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:00.469 align:start position:0%
society-wide conversation about our
differences

02:21:00.469 --> 02:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
differences
 
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
or is it that good old game of divide
 
02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
and distract
 
02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
today happens to also be the day in a
 
02:21:07.910 --> 02:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
different committee
 
02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
when a very popular minimum wage bill hb
 
02:21:13.590 --> 02:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
517 is being put forward which i also
 
02:21:15.510 --> 02:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
happen to be the lead sponsor
 
02:21:19.270 --> 02:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
does hb 544 distract
 
02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
oh there's trump's name again i was
 
02:21:23.830 --> 02:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
going to say the racist relic of the
 
02:21:26.150 --> 02:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
trump era but i won't say that
 
02:21:29.190 --> 02:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
it gets more inc and airplay than this
 
02:21:32.950 --> 02:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
bill or does the minimum wage bill
 
02:21:35.750 --> 02:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
get less inc than this bill which i
 
02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:36.710 align:start position:0%
get less inc than this bill which i
believe

02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
believe
 
02:21:39.830 --> 02:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage is also
 
02:21:41.910 --> 02:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
supported by most republican
 
02:21:44.550 --> 02:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
rank-and-file voters overwhelmingly
 
02:21:47.670 --> 02:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
one can deny it but we all know racism
 
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
is really in america
 
02:21:51.910 --> 02:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
we all know which of our neighbors or
 
02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:53.680 align:start position:0%

02:21:53.990 --> 02:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
hold
 
02:21:57.349 --> 02:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
blatantly racist views and the blatant
 
02:21:59.349 --> 02:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
example of systemic racism

i am of the opinion that has been
 
02:23:16.389 --> 02:23:16.399 align:start position:0%
expressed by a few of my colleagues that
 
02:23:19.270 --> 02:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
this bill will not pass constitutional
 
02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:20.469 align:start position:0%

02:23:25.190 --> 02:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
that we all witnessed a member of the
 
02:23:27.349 --> 02:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
committee in the room
 
02:23:31.910 --> 02:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
violating the mass distancing policy
 
02:23:33.349 --> 02:23:33.359 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair just a few minutes
 
02:23:43.990 --> 02:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
for my thoughts
 
02:23:47.750 --> 02:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
slavery was abolished 150 years ago
 
02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
but does anyone doubt that racism is
 
02:23:50.560 --> 02:23:51.030 align:start position:0%
but does anyone doubt that racism is
still

02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
still
 
02:23:53.590 --> 02:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
alive and well in this country and this
 
02:23:53.600 --> 02:23:54.710 align:start position:0%
alive and well in this country and this
state

02:23:54.710 --> 02:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
in 2020 we saw many examples of racism
 
02:24:01.270 --> 02:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
ahmad aubry the jogger shot dead when he
 
02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
stopped for a moment to look at the
 
02:24:05.270 --> 02:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
progress of a home under construction
 
02:24:07.750 --> 02:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
i've done that before would those men
 
02:24:09.349 --> 02:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
have shot me
 
02:24:12.230 --> 02:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
a black teenager in a new york hotel
 
02:24:13.990 --> 02:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
attacked by a woman who had lost
 
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
her iphone if i had been standing there
 
02:24:18.230 --> 02:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
with the iphone
 
02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
would she attacked me the newest trend
 
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
in racism seems to be attacking asian
 
02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
americans who are just walking down the
 
02:24:26.080 --> 02:24:27.030 align:start position:0%
americans who are just walking down the
street

02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
street
 
02:24:30.550 --> 02:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
what will be next if passing a law would
 
02:24:33.510 --> 02:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
eliminate racism i would vote for it
 
02:24:37.030 --> 02:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
but no law will cure our problem of
 
02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:38.230 align:start position:0%
but no law will cure our problem of
racism

02:24:38.230 --> 02:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
racism
 
02:24:40.710 --> 02:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
the only way to cure racism and other
 
02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
forms of bias
 
02:24:45.670 --> 02:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
is for everyone to really understand
 
02:24:49.190 --> 02:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
where and how it exists and to know what
 
02:24:53.190 --> 02:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
it feels like to be on the receiving end
 
02:24:55.670 --> 02:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
what we need is more education in
 
02:24:55.680 --> 02:24:56.309 align:start position:0%
what we need is more education in
dialogue

02:24:56.309 --> 02:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
dialogue
 
02:24:59.590 --> 02:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
about racism not less we need to
 
02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:00.469 align:start position:0%
about racism not less we need to
encourage

02:25:00.469 --> 02:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
encourage
 
02:25:03.670 --> 02:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
not stifle teaching about racism
 
02:25:06.630 --> 02:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
at all educational levels it should be
 
02:25:08.309 --> 02:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
woven throughout the curriculum
 
02:25:10.950 --> 02:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
in ways that are age-appropriate and i
 
02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
trust our teachers to do that
 
02:25:16.309 --> 02:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
everyone deserves to feel safe to be
 
02:25:18.070 --> 02:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
treated with dignity
 
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
and to have equal access to a quality
 
02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:21.910 align:start position:0%
and to have equal access to a quality
education

02:25:21.910 --> 02:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:25:25.429 --> 02:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
job opportunities housing loans
 
02:25:28.630 --> 02:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
and business mentorships for this to
 
02:25:30.870 --> 02:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
come about we need to talk about
 
02:25:34.389 --> 02:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
racism i will vote against this bill
 
02:25:37.030 --> 02:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
because it is an unconstitutional
 
02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:37.990 align:start position:0%
because it is an unconstitutional
restriction

02:25:37.990 --> 02:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
restriction
 
02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
on free speech and will inadvertently
 
02:25:45.349 --> 02:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
protect racism rather than condemning it
 
02:25:50.469 --> 02:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just very briefly
 
02:25:54.309 --> 02:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
for me while there
 
02:25:57.510 --> 02:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
may be numerous reasons to uh
 
02:26:01.349 --> 02:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill as a member of the edna
 
02:26:02.950 --> 02:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
committee i will oppose it
 
02:26:05.270 --> 02:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
simply because i have tremendous respect
 
02:26:07.110 --> 02:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
for representative judy
 
02:26:10.550 --> 02:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you
 
02:26:12.309 --> 02:26:12.319 align:start position:0%

02:26:14.950 --> 02:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:17.429 --> 02:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
representative roy i just want to
 
02:26:19.429 --> 02:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
reiterate what i said from the beginning
 
02:26:21.270 --> 02:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
i i would not be voting for this bill if
 
02:26:23.349 --> 02:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
it prohibited the discussion of racism
 
02:26:24.710 --> 02:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
the teaching of the
 
02:26:26.309 --> 02:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
struggles of different races in our
 
02:26:28.230 --> 02:26:28.240 align:start position:0%

the only word that's coming to mind and
 
02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
i do not mean it as a as
 
02:27:03.429 --> 02:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
there's a whitewashing of this
 
02:27:05.110 --> 02:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
discussion upon
 
02:27:08.309 --> 02:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely unintended um
 
02:27:11.270 --> 02:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
that really to me and i believe to many
 
02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:12.070 align:start position:0%
that really to me and i believe to many
folks

02:27:12.070 --> 02:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
folks
 
02:27:15.750 --> 02:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
is the accidental uh step cousin twice
 
02:27:18.389 --> 02:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
removed of holocaust denial
 
02:27:20.790 --> 02:27:20.800 align:start position:0%

does
 
02:27:25.030 --> 02:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
is absolutely censorship um
 
02:27:27.670 --> 02:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
and to approach it in a way that assumes
 
02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:29.190 align:start position:0%
and to approach it in a way that assumes
wrongly

02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
wrongly
 
02:27:32.550 --> 02:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
that somehow white children are being
 
02:27:33.830 --> 02:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
told they're racist
 
02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:36.880 align:start position:0%

02:34:39.830 --> 02:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's because of our education it will
 
02:34:41.429 --> 02:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
die out
 
02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:44.880 align:start position:0%

growing up in the south uh one part of
 
02:35:26.070 --> 02:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
my family is very racist
 
02:35:28.309 --> 02:35:28.319 align:start position:0%
the other part of my family fantastic
 
02:35:30.070 --> 02:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
and i spent more time with them
 
02:35:32.150 --> 02:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
love them i love all my family by the
 
02:35:32.160 --> 02:35:33.110 align:start position:0%
love them i love all my family by the
way

02:35:33.110 --> 02:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:35:37.510 --> 02:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
and my brother adopted two children
 
02:35:40.309 --> 02:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
one from romania because they thought
 
02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
that he would look more like
 
02:35:44.790 --> 02:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
us turns out he's of the roma people and
 
02:35:46.870 --> 02:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
is a person of color
 
02:35:51.510 --> 02:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
and my niece from guatemala a latina
 
02:35:54.790 --> 02:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
so no one talked about it but in the
 
02:35:57.030 --> 02:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
back of my head i'm thinking oh
 
02:36:00.710 --> 02:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
please let the rest of my family
 
02:36:04.070 --> 02:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
embrace my niece and nephew
 
02:36:05.830 --> 02:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
and they're wonderful they've grown up
 
02:36:08.950 --> 02:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
to be wonderful adults
 
02:36:12.469 --> 02:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
and as would happen at a family function
 
02:36:14.630 --> 02:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
without even realizing it one of my
 
02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:15.990 align:start position:0%
without even realizing it one of my
relatives

02:36:15.990 --> 02:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
relatives
 
02:36:18.070 --> 02:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
started spouting off saying a bunch of
 
02:36:19.750 --> 02:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
racist stuff in front of my niece and
 
02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:20.790 align:start position:0%
racist stuff in front of my niece and
nephew

02:36:20.790 --> 02:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
nephew
 
02:36:23.270 --> 02:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
i grabbed that relative pulled him to
 
02:36:24.550 --> 02:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
the hallway
 
02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
and i said have you noticed
 
02:36:31.270 --> 02:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
the skin color of your niece
 
02:36:34.309 --> 02:36:34.319 align:start position:0%

02:36:34.319 --> 02:36:35.270 align:start position:0%
and nephew and it had never occurred to
them

02:36:35.270 --> 02:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:36:38.150 --> 02:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
but i do know from that moment on our
 
02:36:40.630 --> 02:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
conversations around race were radically
 
02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:42.630 align:start position:0%
conversations around race were radically
different

02:36:42.630 --> 02:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
i wish for that for everybody that are
 
02:36:44.880 --> 02:36:46.230 align:start position:0%
i wish for that for everybody that are
racist

02:36:46.230 --> 02:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
racist
 
02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:55.590 --> 02:36:55.600 align:start position:0%

02:37:05.349 --> 02:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
headache for lunch
 
02:37:07.830 --> 02:37:07.840 align:start position:0%

military service because when i joined

the service the first thing i learned is
 
02:37:26.389 --> 02:37:26.399 align:start position:0%
that we were all
 
02:37:30.230 --> 02:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
equally worthless and
 
02:37:32.469 --> 02:37:32.479 align:start position:0%
nobody was better facing their race and
 
02:37:33.910 --> 02:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
i learned to put my hands
 
02:37:35.349 --> 02:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
that my life in the hands of other
 
02:37:37.030 --> 02:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
people of different colors and they
 
02:37:40.389 --> 02:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
me and by the end of it
 
02:37:47.190 --> 02:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
