00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Thank you.

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Thank you.

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Thank you.

12
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Thank you.

13
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Thank you.

14
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Thank you.

15
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Thank you.

16
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Thank you.

17
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Thank you.

18
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Thank you.

19
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Thank you.

20
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.500
you you got 10 minutes to do it thanks very much Thank you.

21
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.500
Thank you.

22
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.500
Thank you.

23
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.500
Thank you.

24
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.500
Thank you.

25
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.500
Thank you.

26
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.500
Thank you.

27
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.500
Thank you.

28
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500
Thank you.

29
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.500
Thank you.

30
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:10.000
So the time being 930 and we have scheduled CACR 13 dealing with legislator compensation.

31
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I have a pin card for two people.

32
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So I would call on the prime sponsor, Representative Deshaies.

33
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.500
I think you need to push that.

34
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.500
There you go.

35
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.500
Oh, there we go.

36
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.500
Thank you.

37
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.000
I think you need to push that.

38
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
There you go.

39
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Oh, there we go.

40
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.500
Okay, the red means go.

41
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.500
That's a little backwards.

42
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.500
We should fix that.

43
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.500
Well, thank you, Mr.

44
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.000
Chairman, and thank you, Committee, for letting me speak to CIA.

45
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.500
Were you going to say something, Mr.

46
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.500
Chair?

47
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.500
Okay.

48
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.000
To To a constitutional CACR13 relating to legislator compensation.

49
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.500
This legislation seeks to reduce legislators pay including the speaker and the Senate president to two cents for our biennium session.

50
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.500
It also reduces our daily pay for special session to one cent.

51
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.500
I'm going to be fairly brief.

52
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.000
There's not too much to this legislation.

53
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The purpose is to just meet the current expectations Granite Staters have for legislative compensation in New Hampshire.

54
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Granite Staters are told we're volunteers and we make no salary, and this constitutional amendment, if approved by the voters, will ensure we are true volunteers.

55
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So why should we move our pay to two cents?

56
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.500
Well, the reason is to ensure, well, why should we keep our pay?

57
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:17.500
Well, the reason why I decide to keep our pay instead of completely eliminating it like 10 to 15 other states have is to ensure there's no complications for legislators who participate in the state's health care plan.

58
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:34.500
I know municipalities in New Hampshire compensate volunteer firefighters or other volunteer positions who undo things for the municipality at $1 a year for the same reasons to ensure that they're still considered employees.

59
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:48.500
I'm not sure how it works constitutionally for our state legislators, but I didn't want to run into that issue as that being a barrier to pass this.

60
00:03:48.500 --> 00:04:07.500
I would encourage the committee to amend CACR 13 to make legislators pay $0 if it means the zero dollar pay doesn't complicate legislators acquiring the benefits that they paid into for the system that they paid into.

61
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.500
If voters approve this constitutional amendment, it will save the state $85,000 a year.

62
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:28.000
I know this is minuscule to the entirety of the state budget, but currently the $85,000 isn't being utilized in the most efficient or effective way possible.

63
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:37.500
The $200 to $200 we're paid every biennium has really no demonstrable ways helps legislators better serve their constituents.

64
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:45.500
The state could better allocate our tax dollars on almost nearly anything else in our budget.

65
00:04:45.500 --> 00:05:00.000
I'd suggest hiring more staff at the Office of Legislative Services myself, but that would be a decision for the Finance Committee to make for our next state budget.

66
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:23.000
I think we should give the voters a voice and allow them to choose if New Hampshire's lawmakers will become, you know, truly volunteer legislators and if law or if they're gonna let us still collect our $200 in taxpayer money for our own personal use.

67
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:33.500
I think this is just enabling voters to have that voice to say, you know, New Hampshire politicians should be volunteers.

68
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.500
They shouldn't be getting the $200.

69
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:47.000
The $200 doesn't serve any utility to overall how we do our services for them or most of our daily lives.

70
00:05:47.000 --> 00:06:00.000
So I think that we should let the voters have the choice to make that decision to lower our pay and make it next to zero.

71
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:10.500
And if possible, the committee could amend it and make it so then we're full volunteers that don't make any compensation.

72
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.500
That's all.

73
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.500
Thank you.

74
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.500
Thank you.

75
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:22.000
Will you accept questions from the committee if there are any?

76
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Yep.

77
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:49.500
Are there any I can but it's mostly just bullet notes but if you wouldn't if you'd like me to yeah I get I can email it to you if you'd like is it easier for the clerk okay I'll submit it then I'll email it to you if you'd like.

78
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.500
It's purely up to you, whatever you want to do.

79
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.500
Is it easier for the clerk?

80
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.500
It's just something to submit, yes.

81
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:09.000
Okay, I'll submit it, then I'll send it to you in an email when I get home.

82
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Thank you.

83
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Thanks.

84
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Any others?

85
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
No?

86
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
We're good?

87
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
One real quick.

88
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
It seems obvious, but I just want to make sure.

89
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.500
So in the CACR, the basically zero compensation would remain a part of the Constitution.

90
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.500
We're not pulling pay out of the Constitution.

91
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:48.000
The Constitution would simply say that at this point we make one cent or two cents or whatever the compensation is.

92
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Correct.

93
00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:02.500
We're just, it's just amending our current because our compensation is based on, it says shall on, I believe it's line three of the bill.

94
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.500
So line three.

95
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.500
Yep.

96
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.500
On line three it says shall.

97
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:48.500
I believe it's line three of the bill so line three yep on line three it says shall and so basically we constitutionally bind you know our our government to pay us that amount and instead of getting rid of compensation because I believe there should be some kind of you know in our Constitution it should be constitutional what our pay is we're just asking the voters to approve a constitutional amendment to make it two cents.

98
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:54.500
It's not going to affect any other kinds of things like mileage.

99
00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:02.500
It's just the biennium compensation that legislators are given to kind of give some historical context.

100
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:12.500
$200 back when the voters last approved the legislative pay increase was equivalent, adjusted for inflation, a little over $5,000.

101
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.000
We haven't adjusted it since.

102
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
A reason for that is because expectations have changed, right?

103
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Times have changed, right?

104
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:33.500
People used to come down here on horses or would walk to legislative sessions, right, from Coas County, Carroll County, Grafton County, right?

105
00:09:33.500 --> 00:10:36.000
So that would actually take possibly weeks, right, that they'd have to give up of farms that they tended to or local businesses now we drive you know getting to session for example is me waking up taking a warm shower you know using plumbing coming down here in a car in an hour and giving my testimony and I'll drive home and get back to work which I'll do online from home right so times have changed we can do this fully volunteer and I think the voters kind of have that expectation at this point so we should have our Constitution reflect that but with their approval okay yep so I think you know some of the things that we Thank you, Mr.

106
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Chair.

107
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Representative Speedy.

108
00:10:40.000 --> 00:11:02.000
So I think, you know, some of the things that we, like, you know, I know that the 200 isn't, you know, I don't use this to live my lavish lifestyle, but there are a few, you know, things that we do pay for.

109
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
They're not a lot.

110
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
I mean, license plates, business cards, probably nameplates.

111
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:16.500
So would you be open to the idea of maybe reducing it to $20 to cover that?

112
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:26.000
Because I know that these are just small fees, but they're some of the things we do pay for.

113
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.500
I hear you, Representative Speedy, and thank you for your question.

114
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.500
I don't think so.

115
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.500
I think many of those things are luxuries.

116
00:11:37.500 --> 00:12:02.500
I think they're not necessary to do our job necessarily and I think people when they run should understand the kind of responsibilities that they assume and if they think that they need a license plate or business cards to do the job then that's something that they should consider.

117
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:20.000
You know I knew when I ran for office I knew there'd be certain costs and certain amount of time that I'd have to give up in my day to be able to do this.

118
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
And it's something I love to do for my constituents.

119
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.500
And I assume everyone in the room feels the same way.

120
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.500
But I think we tell voters we're volunteers.

121
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:42.500
I think the $85,000 we spend on volunteers could be better spent elsewhere in our budget.

122
00:12:42.500 --> 00:13:19.000
And I think letting the voters choose to approve an amendment that would properly reflect the pay that they expect I think is a um I think it's the right thing to do personally but that's going to be the committee's ultimate decision no no follow-up representative thank you thank you for taking my question I'm sorry I came in a little late um and so I didn't hear all of your testimony.

123
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:42.500
I'm assuming that you are aware that representatives need to take the $200 or the $100 a year, and in fact there is a way that you just contact the offices and tell them that you do not want to accept the salary, such as I do.

124
00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.000
Are you aware of that?

125
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:52.500
I am aware, but I don't think there should be any option to even accept.

126
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.500
Follow up?

127
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.500
Follow up.

128
00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:11.500
So the folks that really do rely on this to offset some of their expenses, they understand that they're not getting a salary like the folks out in the community.

129
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:31.000
Have you done any kind of research as to the folks that are currently accepting the salary and whether or not they know that they do not have to accept that salary and give them the process for it?

130
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Thank you for your question, Representative.

131
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:42.500
I have not done any research into that, but I certainly can if you'd like me to.

132
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.500
No, I'm not asking you to.

133
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:57.000
Thank you for your question representative I have not done any research into that but I certainly can if you'd like me to.

134
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
No I'm not asking you to.

135
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Thank you.

136
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Okay.

137
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Done.

138
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
I have one question.

139
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:17.500
Is it your belief that the current $200 for two years is not considered volunteerism by the general public?

140
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.500
That's a tough question.

141
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:23.500
Well, thank you for your question first, Mr.

142
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.500
Chairman, and that's a tough question.

143
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:31.000
I think it would depend on who you ask.

144
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.500
It would definitely be more of an anecdotal thing.

145
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:47.500
It's not something that I've ever, you know, genuinely gone around to my constituent and asked them $100, you know, a year compensation volunteering.

146
00:15:47.500 --> 00:16:13.500
But I'm not sure entirely if $200 is, I think it's, first off, the kind of cost that we've discussed that, you know, some legislators might say that they need, which I still think is optional, but like a license plate, business cards, et cetera, isn't much more than $40 or $50.

147
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:25.500
So if that's the kind of cost we're talking about covering, right, then we're definitely overcompensating our legislators by about four times as much.

148
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:37.000
I still think that legislators before they assume the office or even decide to run for the office should know the assumed cost.

149
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:50.500
I still think that the voters should have the option of whether or not to essentially zero out our pay, and that's for the committee to decide.

150
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.500
Thank you.

151
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.000
Thank you for your testimony.

152
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.500
Thank you for having me.

153
00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.500
Appreciate it.

154
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.500
Chair will call Timothy Horrigan for two minutes.

155
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.500
Thank you very much.

156
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.000
Thank you very much Mr.

157
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Chair.

158
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000
I'll try to keep it around two minutes but I can't guarantee.

159
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
I submitted a...

160
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.500
Maybe I'll take my mask off so I can be heard more clearly.

161
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:37.000
I submitted what appeared to be a similar CACR, which eliminated the provision, and I think it went to another committee and was ITL unanimously.

162
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:50.000
And then it was one of the bills that kind of ended up in limbo, just because of the strange way we did things in 2021.

163
00:17:50.000 --> 00:18:01.500
And actually probably this CSR probably under normal circumstances probably couldn't have been brought forward because it's so similar to the other one.

164
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:49.000
My intent, and I think the intent of the prime sponsor but she can't speak for herself she's elsewhere today was actually we would set our salary in statute like we do for all the other state offices including including actually the county delegation each of us belongs to a county delegation, and there is actually an RSA 24 where we set our salaries for that one, although that's also a fairly token amount, except when I have an executive committee meeting that gets over in 20 minutes, maybe $25 for that is fair compensation.

165
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:56.000
So I think there's no dishonor in paying people for the work, including ourselves.

166
00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:04.000
And so I certainly, I'm certainly, I was not aware that you can refuse a check.

167
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.500
I do know that some members do donate their salary checks to charity.

168
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.500
I've heard of that.

169
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:23.500
And also there's a whole thing with the-2s, where some members say they're not employees, and so don't fill out the W-2.

170
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:27.000
But it gets the history of it.

171
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Representative Deshaies correctly pointed out that when we put this in the Constitution in 1887, we got $100 a year and it's been unchanged ever since.

172
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.500
And then, so that would be probably about $5,000.

173
00:19:44.500 --> 00:20:03.000
That would be about, but actually at the same time, the governor's salary that year, Governor Moody Currier, I only remember that because I was looking at my testimony from last year, he made, I think, $143,000.

174
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
No, he made $2,000.

175
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.500
This year, Chris Sununu made a little over $143,000.

176
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:13.500
If $120,000 would be a little over $7,000.

177
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:19.500
I think that would probably be a more appropriate figure than $100.

178
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:32.500
Of course, anybody who doesn't feel like they want to accept a check are free to turn it down, free to donate to charity or whatever.

179
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:54.000
But I think that's actually probably, if you multiply the amount of time it does to do this job at a minimally competent level times the minimum wage, and of course what the minimum wage is under controversy, that's not out of line.

180
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Adjusted to inflation, it's somewhat less than that.

181
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.500
That would be, I think, about 2,600.

182
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.000
That's also better than 100.

183
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
So I basically feel there's no dishonor in paying people.

184
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:29.000
I think it makes us take it a little bit more seriously, which is not a problem with any of the members on this committee, but there are other members who maybe don't take it as seriously as they should.

185
00:21:29.000 --> 00:22:00.000
And perhaps after they're making something more than a token salary they would make more of an effort I always tell people I'm worth every penny of the hundred dollars a year they pay me so I guess that's what I'm so I think probably the best thing to do this is ITL it's just like you we did year with CACR5.

186
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:09.500
Hopefully we'll be able to actually get it to the floor and vote ITL instead of that silly miscellaneous.

187
00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:25.000
And failing that at some point, I think we do need to look into perhaps raising the salary to something that's more akin to what $100 a year was in 1887.

188
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:45.500
And so certainly something in the mid-four figures would not be inappropriate, and that would probably enable a wider cross-section of society to be able to afford to run for it, because it costs a lot more than $40 to run.

189
00:22:45.500 --> 00:23:31.500
And just one more thing, we were hearkening back to how it was in the good old days like in the 17th in the 18th and 19th centuries and long in the 20th century actually what happened was the full contingent would we'd get together in december for organization day they would come back on new year around new year's day for a few days on january 1st and they would usually stay in hotels or boarding houses in time and And we were also paid mileage, which is a lot more.

190
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:36.500
The mileage was a lot more than it is today.

191
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:45.500
It wasn't until about 1960 that the mileage payments were fixed at the level they are at now.

192
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:51.000
And so they would come for a little while in January.

193
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Then they'd go back.

194
00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:19.500
and then not that everybody was a farmer but when those of us who were those members who were in agriculture finished planting their crops and things calmed down a little in June, they would usually get together for like a month or two, and then if necessary come back in the fall.

195
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:29.500
So they used to have a somewhat different rhythm, so people didn't used to commute back and forth every day.

196
00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:54.000
And actually for a long time, we got free railroad passes, which would be kind of the equivalent in today's terms of giving everyone a free Uber pass, which is, you know, that was like a very, that was probably like a very valuable piece of compensation back then.

197
00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:04.500
So anyway, I think we should be paid something, and, you know, $100 a year is more appropriate than two cents.

198
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:10.000
So I think I'm perfectly comfortable continuing to pay the legislators.

199
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:26.000
And there's probably some value, I think it makes us more sympathetic to the concerns of working people too, if we're at least paid salary even if it's not a huge one.

200
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Thanks.

201
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:41.000
So that's basically the urgent ITL which I would be very surprised if any other result came out of the committee when you vote on it.

202
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
But thank you.

203
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Thank you.

204
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Will you take questions if there are any?

205
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Even though I'm well over my two minutes I'm sure.

206
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Nope, we're all set.

207
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Thank you.

208
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Will you take questions if there are any?

209
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Sure.

210
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Even though I'm well over my two minutes, I'm sure.

211
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Yeah.

212
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Nope, we're all set.

213
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Thank you very much.

214
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
All right, thank you.

215
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
I have no other pink cards.

216
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:28.500
With that, we have a 10-minute respite until 10 o'clock when we will be hearing CACR 23.

217
00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:34.000
be able to shut that off there we go Thank you.

218
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Thank you.

219
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Thank you.

220
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Thank you.

221
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Thank you.

222
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Thank you.

223
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Thank you.

224
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Thank you.

225
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Thank you.

226
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Thank you.

227
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Thank you.

228
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Thank you.

229
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Thank you.

230
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Thank you.

231
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Okay, we're back 10 o'clock by my clock.

232
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:13.500
the hearing on CACR 23, which deals with reference to persons in the New Hampshire Constitution being gender neutral.

233
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:22.000
We have the prime sponsor, Representative LaBranch, scheduled for just two minutes, but welcome to legislative administration.

234
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Glad to be here and thank you, Chairman.

235
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000
I will keep it very brief.

236
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.500
It's a very simple CACR.

237
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:48.000
It simply seeks to make the Constitution gender neutral as in instead of he or she, which is a similar CACR in 1997, which passed both the House and Senate on bipartisan votes.

238
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
It is the same bill except of he or she.

239
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.500
It will say the governor or whatever position is referenced in the Constitution.

240
00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:11.500
The reason that it did not pass fully was when it was put to the voters in 1998, it failed to meet the threshold.

241
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:21.000
It was just 10% shy from passing, with 56% of New Hampshire voters voting in favor of this CACR.

242
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.500
This is, like I said, a very similar CACR.

243
00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:55.000
Instead of making it three words, he or she, it will just say the title of the position that it is talking about so that is pretty much my testimony it's very simple and I'm happy to answer any questions that the committee might have thank you for your brevity we do have one question for you Representative Roulard.

244
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Hi.

245
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.500
Thanks for taking my question.

246
00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:04.500
How many other states have done this to their constitutions?

247
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:25.500
It is, to the best of my knowledge, at least 10 other states have made their constitutions just very technical documents that only state the name of the position and not using any gendered terminology like he or she in their constitutions.

248
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.500
Follow up?

249
00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.500
Follow up.

250
00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:39.500
Does that mean that they went back and edited their constitution or was their constitution worded differently in the beginning?

251
00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:45.000
In some cases, it was just they wrote it that way.

252
00:29:45.000 --> 00:30:25.000
In other states, I know on the West west coast they've gone back and changed it so that it is gender neutral as I seek to do today with a referendum when the CICR passes the House and Senate do you know how many went back and changed the gender how many states on the top of my head I do not know but I could get that to the committee later today thank you further questions thank you mr.

253
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:44.000
chairman thank you for taking my question um I mean I understand the general scope of what you're trying to accomplish here but you're not insinuating that the language that's there now isn't gender neutral in effect, correct?

254
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Oh, no.

255
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:52.500
For a fact, it is gender neutral in the eyes of the law.

256
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:58.500
This is just a very technical change, just to simplify the Constitution.

257
00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.500
Follow up?

258
00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:10.000
So, just for clarity from my perspective, from your perspective, what is the ultimate benefit in doing that then?

259
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:20.000
A lot of this is mostly to update the Constitution with the language of today and the culture of today.

260
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Back when the Constitution was written, women could not vote, and it was he as the gendered term.

261
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:36.000
This seeks to just update it to our modern day society and gender equality.

262
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
I don't see why it should say he or she.

263
00:31:41.000 --> 00:32:03.000
When we're talking about a position such as the governor or the Supreme Court justice or any other term, this is just, I would say, simplifying the Constitution and making it up to date thank you appreciate it representative this media thank you mr.

264
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:29.500
chair I hate using these type of questions but I you know reading this I had no idea that the Constitution wasn't gender neutral reading you know Constitution says you know the governor his and you know which you know we, we've had a pretty strong history of women governors in the state.

265
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:39.500
Would you believe that most people don't know that the constitution actually has, isn't gender neutral and mostly male pronouns?

266
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.000
I would agree with that.

267
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:51.000
And as the previous representative had asked me, in the eyes of the law, it is gender neutral.

268
00:32:51.000 --> 00:33:02.000
This is just a very technical update so that we are very clear about what we are talking about in the Constitution.

269
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:15.000
I understand that it was probably just the language of the time that they used he or she, or I should say he in this context.

270
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:25.000
and this would just make it clear that when they're talking about in the Constitution currently it says he shall.

271
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.500
Instead it would say the governor shall.

272
00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:32.000
So it will be more explicitly clear.

273
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
I have one question if you don't mind.

274
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.500
It's on page six and line 11.

275
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.000
I'm looking at their excellency.

276
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Would that be how the governor is referred?

277
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Their excellency?

278
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:56.000
That would be, I don't believe that will be changing at all, his or her excellency.

279
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:07.500
I believe the the pronoun at the beginning is mostly optional but their excellency is what is used in other countries as well.

280
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:16.000
So you're saying that someone would, it says whose title shall be their excellency rather than his.

281
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Yep.

282
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.500
So they would be called their excellency.

283
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:29.000
To my knowledge, when we had female governors, they were not called his excellency either.

284
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:45.000
This would just clarify that as well because if it says His Excellency currently it doesn't make sense that if we have a female governor we would be saying His Excellency either.

285
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:57.000
I understand but you're crossing out his and presumably hers if we had a female governor and you would replace that with their excellency.

286
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
That is correct.

287
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Anyone else?

288
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
No further questions?

289
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.500
Thank you for your testimony.

290
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:10.500
The chair will call Representative, Representative Murray, representing Hillsborough 22.

291
00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.500
Welcome to legislative administration.

292
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.000
Thank you for having me.

293
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:22.000
So, yes, my position, yes, for the record, my name is Representative Megan Murray.

294
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000
I represent the town of Amherst.

295
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.500
My pronouns are she, her.

296
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:36.000
But when I am, I come in support of the CACR as a co-sponsor to the bill.

297
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:48.500
But I also think that, like the sponsor mentioned, leaving out an entire pronoun here, she, her, is not referenced at all in the Constitution.

298
00:35:48.500 --> 00:36:03.500
I do also think when we were having the discussion about they there, that is a more universal pronoun to be able to use for any person seeking that office.

299
00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:12.000
So I am fully in support of making that change so that there is gender neutral language.

300
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Happy to take any questions if you should have them.

301
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000
That's okay.

302
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.500
Are there any questions for Representative Murray?

303
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.500
Seeing none, thank you.

304
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.500
Thank you very much.

305
00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:34.000
I have only one other PIN card, and that is for the Honorable Dan Itza.

306
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Inimitable Dan Itza.

307
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Thank you, Mr.

308
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Chairman.

309
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:48.500
Members of the committee, for the record, I am Dan Itza, and I am residing in Manchester.

310
00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:54.000
I do rise in opposition to this, mostly for practical reasons.

311
00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:03.000
As was stated by the prime sponsor, the Constitution that is currently written is accepted as gender neutral.

312
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:15.500
The pronoun he is generally understood in these contexts to refer to anyone and it's not kept any females from being elected to any position.

313
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:19.500
So from a practical perspective, it changes nothing.

314
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:33.000
However, it's been held that generally speaking an amendment to the Constitution should not involve one more than one article at a time, to clarify the situation.

315
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:51.000
There has been an issue in past constitutional amendments, constitutional conventions, on the 1960s one, I forget what year in particular, but there were so many amendments coming out of that convention that they staggered them.

316
00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:05.000
They didn't offer them all the first opportunity after the convention, but they put two or three in election cycle for several election cycles because it was overwhelming.

317
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:15.000
Also, I think in a wise move, in about 2006, we required that all amendments be printed on the ballot.

318
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:28.000
That means that were this to go to the people, disregarding anything else that may be on the ballot, the ballot would be 12 pages long.

319
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
For everybody.

320
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000
That's a substantial document.

321
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:46.500
Finally, the last time that this number of amendments were made to the Constitution was in 1792 and actually not as many amendments articles were amended as this proposes.

322
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:53.500
The change to the Constitution was considered so extensive that they re-enrolled the Constitution.

323
00:38:53.500 --> 00:39:01.000
And I think that would be obligated obligatory upon us as well at this point.

324
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.500
So you're taking a much larger step.

325
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:12.000
We would no longer be under the Constitution of 1792, but the Constitution of 2022.

326
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.500
I'd be happy to take any questions.

327
00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.500
Thank you.

328
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.000
Except I don't see any.

329
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Thank you very much, Honorable Itza.

330
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Welcome back.

331
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.500
Chair has one last pink card for Representative Toll.

332
00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:33.000
Welcome, Representative Toll, to the Legislative Administration.

333
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Thank you very much.

334
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Honorable members of the Legislative Administration Committee, my name is Amanda Elizabeth Toll, and I represent the city of Keene at large.

335
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:59.000
I am here today to speak in support of CACR 23, which provides that all references to persons in the New Hampshire Constitution be gender neutral.

336
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:07.500
CACR 23 is a critical component of the movement towards equality for all genders in New Hampshire.

337
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:18.000
Making this change in the Constitution would be particularly beneficial for enhancing the equality of women and the LGBTQ plus community.

338
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:26.500
It is my firm belief that all people should be seen and recognized for who they are.

339
00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:38.500
When our state and national constitution were written, women had an extremely limited role in public life and were excluded from the political process.

340
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:57.000
From the first sentence of the document, which states that all men are born equally free and independent, it reflects the patriarchal values away from which we have been moving as a society since this country's founding.

341
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:12.500
To paraphrase the UNESCO 2019 Priority Gender Equality Guidelines, the underlying principle of gender-inclusive language is that in all communications, all genders are equal and should be treated and respected equally.

342
00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:22.500
In language, this equality takes the form of overall gender balance and elimination of terms that stereotype, exclude, or demean.

343
00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:30.000
Using gender fair and inclusive language helps reduce gender stereotyping and promotes positive social change.

344
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Updating language use has historically been a critical component of social progress and the movement towards inclusivity for all groups.

345
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:59.500
Further, enshrining gender equality in language of the Constitution represents a step towards the prevention of social and legal regression as women and LGBTQ plus persons continue to face repeated attempts to limit their agency, bodily autonomy, and self-expression.

346
00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:05.500
Language signals where groups of people exist on the spectrum of equality.

347
00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:15.000
At this point in history, all genders are included in the political process as both voters and as legislators.

348
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:23.000
The proposed change is one way of affirming that all are welcome in the political process.

349
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.500
This is a step towards enhancing democracy.

350
00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.000
Thank you for your time.

351
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000
I'm going to defer any questions to the prime sponsor.

352
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Thank you so much.

353
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Thank you.

354
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:45.500
seeing no other pink cards, I am going to close the hearing on CACR 23.

355
00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:52.500
And our next CACR 24 will start in just about 30 minutes at 1045.

356
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.500
Thank you.

357
00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.500
Thank you.

358
00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.500
Thank you.

359
00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.500
Thank you.

360
00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.500
Thank you.

361
00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:04.500
Thank you.

362
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.500
Thank you.

363
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.500
Thank you.

364
00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.500
Thank you.

365
00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.500
Thank you.

366
00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.500
Thank you.

367
00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.500
Thank you.

368
00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.500
Thank you.

369
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.500
Thank you.

370
00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.500
Thank you.

371
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.500
Thank you.

372
00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.500
Thank you.

373
00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.500
Thank you.

374
00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.500
Thank you.

375
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.500
Thank you.

376
00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:34.500
Thank you.

377
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.500
Thank you.

378
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.500
Thank you.

379
00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.500
Thank you.

380
00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.500
Thank you.

381
00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.500
Thank you.

382
00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.500
Thank you.

383
00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.500
Thank you.

384
00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.500
Thank you.

385
00:43:50.500 --> 00:44:03.000
So by this clock it's 1045 so we will open the hearing on CACR 24 and call the prime sponsor Representative Sober from Belknap 2.

386
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Welcome.

387
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Thank you very much.

388
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Is this thing on?

389
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Oh, there we go.

390
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Yes.

391
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Now it's on.

392
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Yes, it is.

393
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Thank you, Mr.

394
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Chair and members of the committee.

395
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.500
Thank you for allowing me to make this presentation.

396
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:54.000
When I filed CACR24, my original feeling was that it seemed to be sort of anomalous to the structure of our government in the state for the Attorney General, the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the state, to be appointed by the governor, affirmed in what is essentially a rubber stamp by the executive council.

397
00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:03.500
And we look to them, to the attorney general, he or she, to be the chief law enforcement officer.

398
00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:18.500
And the history in the last 10, 15 years of major financial scandals, for example, the The FRM scandal is one of abject interaction, inaction by the Attorney General's office.

399
00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:27.500
So I thought, okay, let's have it elected just like the General Court elects the Secretary of State.

400
00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:33.500
Let's have the AG elected by the General court the same way.

401
00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:47.500
And of course, in my goofy way of working with OLS, I produced the CACR 24, and some wiser heads prevailed and pointed out to me potential ambiguities.

402
00:45:47.500 --> 00:46:01.500
So I basically cribbed their suggestions, sent it to OLS, asked them to do a committee amendment, a proposed committee amendment, and so you should have a copy.

403
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:08.500
This is 2022-0058H, which basically tinkers with the language, but it's the same thing.

404
00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:24.000
It basically says that the general court, it moves the attorney general out of its one section of the Constitution into the section with the Secretary of State for electoral purposes.

405
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:37.000
If it passes, there are some, by the electorate, there are some RSAs that next time we would have to deal with and do some adjusting.

406
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
No question about that.

407
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:55.500
I also passed, and there's copies of the amendment for everybody, I also passed out a copy, since we all know that if anything appears on the internet, it must be true, right?

408
00:46:55.500 --> 00:47:07.000
So I picked up from Ballotopedia and Wikipedia an analysis of the states in the country that elect or appoint its attorney general.

409
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:14.500
And it turns out that 43 states directly elect their attorney general by the people.

410
00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.500
43 states.

411
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:20.000
Seven, we are one of the seven.

412
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Attorney general is appointed by the governor in only five states, our being one, New Jersey, Alaska, Hawaii, and Wyoming.

413
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:41.000
In Maine, the Attorney General is chosen by the state legislature, while in Tennessee the choice falls to the state Supreme Court.

414
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.500
So 43 states elect directly.

415
00:47:43.500 --> 00:48:00.500
If this committee and members of the committee felt like a further amendment might be appropriate to make the election of the Attorney General done directly by the electorate, I would support it 110%.

416
00:48:00.500 --> 00:49:05.500
I don't know whether there's any taste for that, but I think that whatever the taste is, whether it's to have the general court elected like the Secretary of State is elected or to give it to the people which we seem to want to embody all of our values in the votes of the individuals and the citizens of our state by all means let's do it but the current system doesn't work well and I think it's time for a change and that's all I have to say and I'm happy to take any questions thank you for your testimony are there any questions for the prime sponsor I see one you need to turn on your microphone yeah you have to push the button on your microphone.

417
00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.500
There you go.

418
00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:13.500
Can you tell me why you think the current system doesn't work?

419
00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:42.500
Mainly because of my experience in Belknap II, which was the epicenter of the FRM scandal several years ago, in which many of my constituents lost many millions of dollars, and even with the legislature's attempt at setting up this, that's now in the budget, this recovery fund, it will give them a few pennies on the dollar.

420
00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:58.500
When we look back at the analysis of the three agencies involved in oversight of this regulated industry, the only one that was not asleep at the switch was the securities division.

421
00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:06.000
The banking division was probably the worst, and the second was the attorney general's office.

422
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:18.500
And I can tell you that I had occasion to harangue one of the staff of the Attorney General's office after the dust had settled.

423
00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:26.000
And I said something to the effect, why didn't you guys get on this thing?

424
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:36.000
And the answer was, well, we were new in the office and we really didn't know what was going on.

425
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.500
And the dog ate our homework, basically homework basically.

426
00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:47.500
So you know basically right now the Attorney General's principal role is prosecuting homicides.

427
00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:56.000
County attorneys prosecute anything but homicides and misdemeanors I guess go down to the the police prosecutors.

428
00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:03.500
So they fine, they can do that, but let's reassert some separation of powers here.

429
00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:05.500
Separation of powers.

430
00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:19.500
Let's let the legislature, either the legislature, do the election of the attorney general, or let's turn it back to the people, which is where it really belongs.

431
00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:27.000
So that's, it's basically my experience with the AG's office mishandling of the FRM scandal.

432
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.500
And I'm sure there's others.

433
00:51:29.500 --> 00:52:01.500
And by the way, the only reason I'm not wearing a mask, for those of you who are mask oriented, is that I had COVID last year, and I recovered, fortunately, and my doctor says that I have very high antibodies and natural immunity now so thank you can you hit your button to take that off representative of the speedy thank you mr.

434
00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:13.500
chair would you be open to amending this to to like the other 43 states to making it elected by the general voting population?

435
00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.500
Absolutely.

436
00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:21.000
Not only be open to it, I would strongly support it.

437
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Further questions?

438
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000
I have one.

439
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:38.000
So is it your contention that the FRM situation you described wouldn't have occurred had the Attorney General been hired or elected by the general court?

440
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:45.000
It's my contention that scandals happen, Ponzi schemes and frauds happen all the time.

441
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:57.000
And whether, however, the attorney general, in a regulated industry, if the attorney general has responsibility for some aspect of policing a regulated industry.

442
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:22.000
I don't think they could have prevented it, but they could have severely narrowed the scope because they could have caught it early on because there were apparently, reportedly, at least 70 instances of misdeeds and questionable conduct that were reported to the different agencies and no action was taken.

443
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:38.500
So they wouldn't have eliminated it, but they would have taken it from a wholesale level, which is what it was, down to a very small retail level if they had acted quickly.

444
00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:51.500
My follow-up is, so purely because they were, the Attorney General's office was appointed by the Executive Branch and Counsel, they were less responsive to this?

445
00:53:51.500 --> 00:54:15.500
and your belief is if they were elected by the general court, they would be more responsive to, or maybe that's a bad word to use, but I'm trying to find what part of this process that's being changed is going to solve the issues that you described.

446
00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:58.000
If the Attorney General is elected by the general court or by the people and they have to stand for re-election periodically and they have to stand for re-election on their record, that, I believe, would be a very salutary effect because early on when these events occurred, whether it's FRM or others, and I'm sure there's probably others, that's just the most widely known one, at least they would know that they have to be responsible to someone other than the governor and council.

447
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:14.000
They have to be responsible to the people, if the people directly elect, as they do in 43 states, or to the general court, just like we elect the Secretary of State.

448
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:24.000
And would the person holding the office change from term to term if it was elected by the general court?

449
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:34.000
I mean, look how long Bill Gardner was in office as Secretary of State, running again and again and again.

450
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:39.500
And there was no problem because he ran a tight ship.

451
00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:45.000
If you run a tight ship, you don't have any problems.

452
00:55:45.000 --> 00:56:03.500
But what I'm trying to do is to put, pardon the expression, the fear of God into people who occupy this position of trust so that we, the people, can actually trust them to do their jobs.

453
00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:05.500
Thank you.

454
00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:08.000
One final question from me.

455
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.500
This would also still remain a two-year term, correct?

456
00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:14.500
Yes.

457
00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:16.500
Yes, correct.

458
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:18.500
I'm fine.

459
00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:20.500
Anyone else?

460
00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:23.000
Thank you for your testimony.

461
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000
Thank you for the committee members hearing me.

462
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:35.500
Chair will call the only other pink card that we have honorable Dan it's Thank you, mr.

463
00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:39.500
Chairman members of the committee for the record.

464
00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:55.500
I'm still Dan it's and I still reside in Manchester I Rise in strong support of this amendment, and I think you need to understand how we got to where we are.

465
00:56:55.500 --> 00:57:02.500
This is not a drastic change from the way the state was originally organized.

466
00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:14.500
When from 1784 to 1792 there was legislative involvement in the election of all appointed officers because they were affirmed by the executive council.

467
00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:24.500
The executive council for those eight years was comprised of two senators and three representatives elected by the general court.

468
00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:41.500
So you had legislative oversight of all these appointments and I would really advocate that for the Attorney General, all department heads, and even the judiciary, that there ought to be legislative oversight reinserted.

469
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:53.500
Because right now, the legislature has no direct input on the executive or judicial branches other than the Secretary of State and the Treasurer.

470
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:56.500
How would it have changed FRM?

471
00:57:56.500 --> 00:58:25.500
Because for all the years that we tried to get the Attorney General to react to FRM and to voter fraud and things like that, if it were the General Court who in some way, shape or form were doing the approval of the nomination when the legislature made a law that said do this, they would obey.

472
00:58:25.500 --> 00:59:06.500
And that's the important part of this is reinforcing our authority over the executive branch and and it's important to remember that there is nothing in our constitution that says the three branches are equal and in fact the way the document is constructed it is the legislature that is the origin of all power in the state we make the laws the first job of the executive is to follow them and the job of the judiciary is to adjudicate them.

473
00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:10.000
I'd be happy to take any questions.

474
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.500
Thank you for your testimony.

475
00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:14.500
I see one question.

476
00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:16.500
Representative Roulard.

477
00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:19.500
Thank you for taking my question.

478
00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:31.500
Do you think the Attorney General, if you had your preference, should be elected by popular vote of the people or by the legislature?

479
00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:35.500
I think it should be by the legislature.

480
00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:55.500
The legislature reflects the popular will of the people by whom they've elected, and it is a group of people who are more intimately familiar with what is demanded of the Attorney General and the organs of government in general.

481
00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:57.500
Thank you.

482
00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:59.500
Anyone else?

483
00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:01.500
I have one question.

484
01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.500
Yes, sir.

485
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:13.500
Do you see any downside to this type of approach with the Attorney General being elected from the general court?

486
01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:23.500
As has been constructed, the one downside I see is a competitive election, so to speak, people running for office.

487
01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:36.000
If I had written it, I would have made it a nomination by governor and counsel to be affirmed by the legislature in joint session.

488
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Thank you.

489
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
One final question.

490
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Were you speaking more to the CACR as it exists the amendment, if you have not seen it?

491
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
I don't know.

492
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I have not seen the amendment as it's been described to me.

493
01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.500
I don't think it is that different.

494
01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:20.500
I think if I understand correctly, one of the primary issues of the amendment is that it moves the election of the Attorney General into the same session as the Secretary of State, which is executed in the same manner.

495
01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.500
It does, thank you.

496
01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:27.000
No further questions, thanks very much for coming in.

497
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
No more pink cards.

498
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Here we are again.

499
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.500
That means we have a Thank you.

500
01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.500
Here we are again.

501
01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:40.500
That means we have a half-hour break, folks.

502
01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:44.000
11.30, we will take up CACR 25.

503
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Thank you.

504
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Thank you.

505
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Thank you.

506
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Thank you.

507
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Thank you.

508
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Thank you.

509
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Thank you.

510
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Thank you.

511
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Thank you.

512
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Thank you.

513
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Thank you.

514
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Thank you.

515
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Thank you.

516
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Thank you.

517
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Thank you.

518
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Thank you.

519
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Thank you.

520
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Thank you.

521
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Thank you.

522
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Thank you.

523
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Thank you.

524
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Thank you.

525
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Thank you.

526
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Thank you.

527
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Thank you.

528
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Thank you.

529
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Thank you.

530
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:48.000
So the time being 1130, I will open the hearing on CACR 25 and recognize the prime sponsor, Representative LaBrench.

531
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Welcome again.

532
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I always forget to take off my mask.

533
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
That's fine.

534
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Thank you, Chair, and thank you, members of the Legislative Administration Committee.

535
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.500
You'll be seeing me a lot today.

536
01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:10.000
A lot of my bills are scheduled for today.

537
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
This CACR is a simple one.

538
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
It's one sentence.

539
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:26.500
It says, No person shall serve more than 15 terms in either the Senate or the House of Representatives, respectively, of the state.

540
01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:34.500
The reason that I'm bringing this forward, I'm going to give a lot of context here.

541
01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:40.500
Before I entered the legislature, I was very opposed to term limits.

542
01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:50.500
I believe that it is up to the people to elect their representatives, choose who they want to represent them.

543
01:03:50.500 --> 01:04:13.000
You can be amazing and serve 13 terms, but when I got elected and seeing how many people have been serving more than 15 terms, I know one representative has served since the year of my mother's birth, which is a long time, since 1974.

544
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:36.500
And I believe that the people of New Hampshire deserve a refreshed voice in the legislature And this is what this seeks to do is to prevent a lifetime Membership of the house and Senate of this state I Will take any questions the committee might have.

545
01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:38.500
Thank you.

546
01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.500
I see one question.

547
01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.500
Representative.

548
01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.500
Thank you Mr.

549
01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.500
Chairman.

550
01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:49.000
Thank you for your testimony.

551
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I personally believe there's a lot of value to experience.

552
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.500
Why would you limit it to 15?

553
01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:09.500
I mean someone could have 16 or a little bit more and have more experience to offer, more insight on some of the issues.

554
01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:15.000
People don't necessarily go stagnant because they're here a long time.

555
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.000
I don't understand what's wrong with going on.

556
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.500
Yeah, I'm asking what's wrong with going more than 15 terms.

557
01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:36.000
When we do the math out, 15 terms, two-year terms, that would be about 30 years of experience in the House and Senate.

558
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
I don't believe there's necessarily anything wrong with having experience.

559
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:54.500
I just believe that there should be a refreshed voice in the legislature with more young representatives and more diversity of opinion in the House and Senate.

560
01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.500
Follow up, Mr.

561
01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.500
Chairman?

562
01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.500
Follow up.

563
01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:03.000
Thank you very much, Mr.

564
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.500
Chairman, and thank you very much for your comments.

565
01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:16.000
In many parts of the state, it's very difficult to find people to run for the legislature.

566
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:35.500
And that being the case, if someone lives in a particular area where it's hard to find someone to run, why would you object to someone coming in more than 15 terms if that person's doing a good job?

567
01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:49.500
To that, I would say that it is a structural issue of the New Hampshire House and of the New Hampshire Senate to find candidates for this office.

568
01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:56.500
I believe a lot of that is related to the salary of the office.

569
01:06:56.500 --> 01:07:04.000
There's many people who cannot work full-time and find the time to be a representative.

570
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:15.000
And this is just a small piece in the puzzle of trying to build a more representative system here in New Hampshire.

571
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.500
Thank you for your answer.

572
01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.500
Thank you.

573
01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.500
Thank you, Mr.

574
01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.500
Chairman.

575
01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.500
You're welcome.

576
01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.500
Further questions?

577
01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:29.500
Representative Simon.

578
01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.000
Are you aware of anybody?

579
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.500
Thank you for taking my question, by the way.

580
01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:52.500
Are you aware of anybody who has been here for, say, 10, 15 terms or so that agrees with your position has the same kind of view as you do on this?

581
01:07:52.500 --> 01:08:06.500
I would say that I believe that most of them are inclined not to support the bill as they are currently further than 15 terms into their terms.

582
01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.500
Okay, thank you.

583
01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.500
Yes, Representative Green.

584
01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:12.500
Thank you, Mr.

585
01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.500
Chair.

586
01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:22.500
Can you tell us how many people in the current legislature this would apply to even?

587
01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:27.000
I mean, it can't be too many, can it?

588
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:53.000
I would say if I'm doing this off the top of my head, it would be at least 25 representatives With the average age of the New Hampshire House being 65 and myself bringing down that average by two years Being the youngest representative of this body Thank you Any further questions?

589
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
I have one.

590
01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:09.500
Thank you for your testimony So my question is do you think this would be taking the privilege from the voters to decide who they want in that office?

591
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:27.000
I believe in the process of a CACR being passed, it will have to be passed by the voters, and I believe it will be ultimately up to the voters if they want term limits.

592
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:49.500
This red legislation actually originally comes from a Republican member of my district, but I believe that the diversity of the New Hampshire House is a bipartisan issue, and getting more representatives and diversity of opinion because new voices bring new ideas in the legislature.

593
01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:54.500
Thank you, but I'm not sure you answered my question.

594
01:09:54.500 --> 01:10:12.500
Do you think that the voters in a district that have someone they feel is reflective of their views and this arbitrary number of 15 limits their ability to decide who they want for their representation.

595
01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:18.500
That was originally my concern as well before I entered the legislature.

596
01:10:18.500 --> 01:11:08.500
I see other states like Florida which have term limits and members can only serve two terms and that's not enough to get experience I learned about that in my local government course with Senator Carson but I would say it's up to the voters in the end if they want term limits or not but I do see that as an issue if they would want that individual to run for something else maybe because it says 15 terms in that House of Representatives if they would want to run for Senate they can run for Senate as well.

597
01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:10.500
Okay thank you.

598
01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:13.500
Seeing none thank you very much.

599
01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:21.000
I only have one other pink card for this, and it's the Honorable Dan Itza.

600
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Thank you, Mr.

601
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Chairman.

602
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
You're welcome.

603
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Welcome back.

604
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000
You have to push a button.

605
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
There you go.

606
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
There we go.

607
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.500
I didn't have to before.

608
01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.500
Thank you, Mr.

609
01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:43.500
Chairman, honorable members of the committee.

610
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.500
I am Dan Itza.

611
01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.500
I reside in Manchester.

612
01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:52.500
And I oppose this proposal with everything I can muster.

613
01:11:52.500 --> 01:12:09.000
I spent nine terms in the legislature, so if this passed, I guess I'd only have another potential a another potential of six so you know I could only serve another 12 years.

614
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:18.000
I view any term limits whether at the state level or the federal level a deprivation of representation.

615
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:26.500
Selden does anybody want to limit their own legislator they always want to limit somebody else's legislator.

616
01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:36.500
There is the value of experience, but more than that, it's the people's choice whom they want to represent them.

617
01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:47.000
And to arbitrarily say that they can no longer have the representative of their choice is an affront to free government.

618
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.500
I'd be happy to take any questions.

619
01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.500
Thank you.

620
01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:56.000
Are there any questions for Honorable Itza?

621
01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Seeing none, actually I have one quick question.

622
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:44.500
Do you know, is it cumulative or is it in total that you can say the way I read it it would be in total because it doesn't say that it has to be consecutive yeah so it would be in cumulative the other thing I'd like to add is I think that the New Hampshire House is a remarkably diverse body by consequence of the fact that we get paid next to nothing, it requires that everybody in one way or another be a member of the community.

623
01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:50.500
Nobody can come up here and park and make this a career.

624
01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:54.500
They have to be out in the community.

625
01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:59.000
They have to work and be part of it.

626
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:05.500
Representative Ingerbertson is one of the premier artists in America, former Representative Ingerbertson.

627
01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:08.500
Former Representative Mirsky is an architect.

628
01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:16.500
Former Representative's, I can't remember, he ran for senator, he was my seatmate back in 2006.

629
01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:34.000
I remember sitting there, I'm there, as you all know, I was poor as a church mouse most of my legislative career, and while we're sitting there he sold a building in Romania for $600,000.

630
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:42.500
I mean, the diversity of the New Hampshire legislature, in my opinion, is nothing short of astounding.

631
01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:44.500
Thank you very much.

632
01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:47.000
Seeing no other pink cards.

633
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.500
And we have the next hearing at 1 o'clock.

634
01:14:51.500 --> 01:15:03.500
I think I can declare an early lunch and and we'll be back at one o'clock and I'll close this hearing on CACR 25.

635
01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.500
Thank you.

636
01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.500
Thank you.

637
01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.500
It's a crapshoot.

638
01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.500
Thank you.

639
01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:13.500

705
01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.500

706
01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:27.500

707
01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:29.500
Thank you.

708
01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.500
Thank you.

709
01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.500
Thank you.

710
01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.500
Thank you.

711
01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:37.500

712

713
01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.500
Thank you.

714
01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:43.500
Thank you.

715
01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:45.500
Thank you.

716
01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:47.500
Thank you.

717
01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.500
Thank you.

718
01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:56.000
The time being one o'clock, I will open the hearing on CACR 31.

719
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Is that right?

720
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
26.

721
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
26.

722
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:07.000
How come I have the thing up here for 21?

723
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
26.

724
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
All right.

725
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Thank you.

726
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:18.000
How come I have the thing up here for 21?

727
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
26.

728
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
All right.

729
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:29.500
This is providing that 100 of the representatives are elected using party list proportional representation.

730
01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:58.000
Prime sponsor is Representative LeBranch, and I think we have Representative LeBranch speak like you to legislative administration again floor is yours thank you chair and thank you again for listening to my testimony today CAC our 26 comes as the United States is facing an era of extreme polarization and extreme toxicity in the political process.

731
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:04.500
It seems hard to sit down with people who have different political views.

732
01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:06.500
It's broken families.

733
01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:41.500
Even in my own family, there's a lot of political disagreement, and it hurts sometimes to get into those arguments and this bill proposing that we adopt party list proportional representation which is another electoral model to use it's used in other countries such as Germany Finland Israel Scotland and New Zealand and many other countries And this electoral system seeks to increase the political diversity in the legislative body.

734
01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:48.500
Most countries that adopt this system have more than five parties in their legislature.

735
01:19:48.500 --> 01:20:00.000
And this makes it so that no party can have, or makes it very difficult for a party to have, an outright majority.

736
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:19.000
And it leads to a form of government that leads to more consensus when you have to sit down and negotiate or talk to other parties and other legislatures to get your bills passed and your legislation through.

737
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:29.500
That's why we see coalition governments in Europe and other countries is because they do have a form of consensus democracy.

738
01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:43.000
And this CACR seeks to start moving towards that direction and building a model based on consensus instead of the current polarized system in which we have.

739
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:54.500
And there are many different versions of party less proportional representation, and I'm glad and I'm happy to answer questions related to that.

740
01:20:54.500 --> 01:21:11.500
But this CACR just says that we will adopt party list proportional and then if this is adopted, then the legislature would choose what type of party list proportional we would like to adopt.

741
01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:15.000
And I'm happy to answer any questions.

742
01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Thank you.

743
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Does anyone on the committee have questions for the representative?

744
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Seeing none I have one question for you.

745
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Can you explain to me how this would work given our current redistricting situation?

746
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:43.000
How would those hundred be referred to by the speaker when they were coming up to the well for instance?

747
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.500
So I would like to explain it like this.

748
01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:58.000
Obviously proportional representation means if a party receives 5% of the vote, it gets 5% of the seats in the legislature.

749
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:03.000
And this would basically make New Hampshire an at-large district.

750
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.500
I know that's hard to think about.

751
01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:10.000
It would be a very big district.

752
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000
But that's how it operates currently in Germany.

753
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:27.500
where parties through the primary process choose a list of candidates that they would like to be elected depending on the proportion of votes that they get.

754
01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:39.000
So in this case, they would have a list of 100 people that they would like to have represent them in the legislature.

755
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:52.500
And depending on the amount of votes, the proportion of votes that they receive, let's say they got 5% of the vote, that's 5% of the seats.

756
01:22:52.500 --> 01:23:02.000
Or let's make it easier, they get 4% of the vote, which is about 16 seats in this legislature.

757
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:07.500
They would get the first 16 people on that list elected.

758
01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:12.500
And I understand with redistricting that makes it more complex.

759
01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:22.500
Either we would have to reapportion those districts or wait until the next redistricting process in 10 years Thank you.

760
01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:26.000
How would it work for county representation?

761
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:33.500
I'm not sure I understand the question well currently state reps are also county reps.

762
01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:39.000
Yep, right so So how would we apportion those county representation?

763
01:23:39.000 --> 01:24:03.000
I believe these representatives would not be county delegates because there is no mechanism, at least unless we flesh it out when the when this is passed we would have to pass something else that explains what form of party list proportional representation we would want to take.

764
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:26.000
But I don't see a mechanism being able to say that we need this many people from Hillsborough on the party list or this many people from Merrimack on the county list because there's no way of knowing who's going to get elected on that list.

765
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:33.000
We don't know before the election if the party's going to get 5%, 50%.

766
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Polling has not been that reliable.

767
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:42.500
But I would see them not being delegates if this were to pass.

768
01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:51.500
And, and would there not be any way of, um of assuring any representation from a particular area?

769
01:24:51.500 --> 01:25:02.000
Or is it possible that some area may have an extraordinary number of representatives and some other area have virtually none?

770
01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:46.500
You bring up a very good point, and that actually brings me to another point I would like to make in Scotland they have a proportional representation system that is by county which is something that we could adopt instead of making the entire state in at-large district we could make every single county in at-large district so that would mean depending on how many seats Hillsborough County gets that would mean 5% of the Hillsborough County at-large seats would be apportioned to the party that gets that vote.

771
01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:54.500
So there is a way that could be based on county and could be county delegates.

772
01:25:54.500 --> 01:26:00.000
But in the way that I had proposed, it would not.

773
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Right.

774
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000
This is not by county that you proposed.

775
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:43.000
If this bill passes, or I should say the CSAR does pass does pass it could be because this just says that we should have proportional representation that is mandated for a hundred seats but it doesn't exactly spell out if it is partyless proportional representation by county or the entire state who would determine who would make that determination the legislature in passing a bill explaining how would we apportion those 100 seats.

776
01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.000
There are many, as I said, forms of proportional representation.

777
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000
There are closed versus open lists.

778
01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I would advise that we adopt an open or a closed list.

779
01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:08.500
Closed list means basically that the lists are determined in party primaries, and then those lists are voted on in the general election.

780
01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:24.500
An open list would make it so that any voter could vote in the primary, which is something that New Hampshire currently does not have, so that does not apply to us.

781
01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:41.000
And then there's the compensatory versus non-compensatory system, which basically means out of those 100 seats, are we saying that if you get 5% of the vote, you get 5% of those seats?

782
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Or are we compensating and saying that you get 5% of the seats in the House?

783
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:58.500
So those would be things that the legislature would have to determine if this constitutional amendment were to pass.

784
01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:00.500
Thank you.

785
01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:04.500
It's a very technical bill so I apologize.

786
01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:11.500
Would there also, so currently we have a number of undeclared or independent voters.

787
01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:20.500
They are currently allowed to declare for a primary and vote in either the Democrat or the Republican.

788
01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:39.500
How would independent under this system, if we went to a closed primary, which I'm hearing we would have to do, it would be the primary that would declare who these people are, if we went that way.

789
01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:47.000
Who would you also be advocating for still allowing independents to declare for a primary?

790
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:52.500
So closed list is just the technical term that I used.

791
01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:57.500
The primaries would stay the same as they currently are.

792
01:28:57.500 --> 01:29:04.000
Independents could still vote in whatever primary they choose and then unregister afterwards.

793
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:13.500
So it would be the same process because it would just be another line item on the primary ballot.

794
01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:20.500
So there's no change in moving to a closed primary or an open primary.

795
01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:25.500
It would just stay the same as it currently is.

796
01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:36.000
But the people that are on that list that are voted for, they would have to declare Republican or Democrat, correct?

797
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:45.500
Yeah, it would be like we currently have in our system where I ran on the Democrat primary ballot.

798
01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:57.500
I was the Democrat candidate in Hillsborough 22, and it would be the same process except either at an at-large statewide or county level.

799
01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.500
I see.

800
01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:01.500
Thank you.

801
01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:03.500
I triggered another question.

802
01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:05.500
Thank you, Representative Simonson.

803
01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:07.500
Thank you, Mr.

804
01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:09.500
Chair.

805
01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:13.500
How does one get on the party list?

806
01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:23.500
From my knowledge of New Hampshire law it would be the same exact process as running for state rep currently.

807
01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:33.500
You would just declare that you would want to run for this district instead of whatever district you live in.

808
01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:45.000
So instead of running for Hillsborough 22 I would say in the form that I would like to run for the at-large position.

809
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
So up?

810
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Follow up.

811
01:30:49.000 --> 01:31:08.000
So being from Littleton in the frozen north, there's this old saying that if you live in Nashua and Manchester, the state basically stops in Concord, and if you live in Concord, the state basically stops in Plymouth.

812
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:30.000
If I were in Littleton, fairly unknown to most of the state, and I wanted to run for one of these positions, how would you keep, let's say, larger Republican areas like Salem from basically determining the vast majority of who gets those seats?

813
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Are you centralizing power, essentially, in certain parts of the state and stripping it from others?

814
01:31:38.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Thank you for the question and to answer your question as I answered earlier this just the CACR just says that we would have a proportional system not exactly how we would move forward with that system but we could do it by a county to the county at large districts so So that would be one way of limiting the influence of the very populous south of New Hampshire.

815
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
One more.

816
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:22.500
So even within a county, however, there are more populous areas and less populous areas.

817
01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:26.000
Would we run into the same problem?

818
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:33.000
And do you have a solution to keep that from happening in your proposal?

819
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:44.500
Where the vast majority of say the representation in grafting County isn't still in the southern part of the of the county itself?

820
01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:57.000
What keeps the southern part of the county from then garnering the vast majority of the representation and leaving the northern part of the county?

821
01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:07.500
Basically without representation That is a very good question We would still have the normal representative districts that we currently have.

822
01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:11.500
Let me think about that for a second.

823
01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:17.500
Yeah, and you can get back to me at a further time.

824
01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:23.500
I don't expect you have all the answers right now, but just...

825
01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:27.500
I believe I'll send you an email later.

826
01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.500
Okay, sounds good.

827
01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:31.500
Thank you.

828
01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:36.000
Nothing further, thank you very much for your testimony.

829
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.500
We have only one other pink card on that.

830
01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:44.500
The Honorable Dan Itza, from Manchester, I believe.

831
01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:46.500
Yes, currently.

832
01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:48.500
Currently.

833
01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:50.500
Thank you, Mr.

834
01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:52.500
Itza.

835
01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:54.500
Thank you, Mr.

836
01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:56.500
Thank you, Mr.

837
01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:59.000
Chairman, members of the committee.

838
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:04.000
I am Dan Itza, and I am living in Manchester.

839
01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:13.500
I do rise in opposition to this proposal, and I'm going to use the Constitution to surprise you all.

840
01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:27.500
All power residing originally in and being derived from the people, all the magistrates of government, are their substitutes and agents and at all times accountable to them.

841
01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:33.500
One of the things that this would create is effectively unaccountable representatives.

842
01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:48.000
One of the things that happens when you have large districts is that the the individual in office is accountable to so many people that they are effectively unaccountable.

843
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:56.000
When in the convention for the Constitution for the United States, George Washington made one comment.

844
01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:01.500
He said 30,000 is representation referring to the House of Representatives.

845
01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:04.500
30,000 is representation, 50,000 is tyranny.

846
01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:11.500
The point being that the more constituents you have, the less accountable you become.

847
01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:20.500
And this would create a cadre of a hundred representatives who are elected by vast numbers of people.

848
01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:26.500
Nobody would be likely to be following their voting record or anything.

849
01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:29.000
They would be effectively unaccountable.

850
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:42.500
It also has, I guess you'd say, an unintended consequence that you then have the remaining 300 reps who are apportioned among the towns and city wards.

851
01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:58.000
So instead of having a representative for every 3,400 people or whatever it is right now you would quickly jump to something more like 5,000 or 5,500 people in an instant.

852
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:08.000
And it would mean a lot of towns, a number of towns would lose their individual representation, which we enjoy.

853
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:29.000
And it's that level of representation that has made New Hampshire number one in personal and economic freedom, which was recently awarded this year, because we have a level of representation that is commensurate with the founding period of the United States.

854
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:34.000
We would be giving up something very near and dear.

855
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:41.500
When you look at areas like Littleton, I think Kowalsk County has about 10 representatives.

856
01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:45.500
Now this is one quarter of the legislature.

857
01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:55.000
If you did it by county, they get two of those representatives, the party affiliated or party list representatives.

858
01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.000
How do you divide them between three parties?

859
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:06.500
You have a third of the state approximately which is unaffiliated with any political party.

860
01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:08.500
Do they get representation?

861
01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:24.000
Not on a party list scheme or do we have or do we call independent voters, unaffiliated voters now their own party which is kind of a backward way of thinking.

862
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:30.000
I mean totally backward, they're a party because they're not a party.

863
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:37.500
I don't think it's a good idea and I'd be happy to take any questions.

864
01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:40.000
Thank you for your testimony.

865
01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Are there any questions?

866
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
One by Representative Rullard.

867
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Thank you for taking my question.

868
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:59.000
The question I have is how will the people in this state know what they're voting for when this is put on the ballot?

869
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Public education classes, I don't know.

870
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:17.500
It is so disparate from anything in our political experience where our politics have been extremely local, where the average person can bump into their state rep in the grocery store.

871
01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:23.000
It would be a disconnection of the legislature from their constituents.

872
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Thank you.

873
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Other questions?

874
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Seeing none, thank you.

875
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Thank you.

876
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.000
We are out of pink cards.

877
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000
We started this at 1 o'clock.

878
01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.500
Our next hearing is at 2 o'clock.

879
01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:43.500
Smoke them if you got them.

880
01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:45.500
Thank you very much.

881
01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:47.500
Thank you.

882
01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:51.500
When we go to the well, we are.

883
01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:53.500
Thank you.

884
01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:55.500
Thank you.

885
01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:57.500
Thank you.

886
01:38:57.500 --> 01:38:59.500
Thank you.

887
01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:01.500
Thank you.

888
01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:03.500
Thank you.

889
01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:05.500
Thank you.

890
01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:07.500
Thank you.

891
01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:09.500
Thank you.

892
01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:11.500
Thank you.

893
01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:13.500
Thank you.

894
01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:15.500
Thank you.

895
01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:17.500
Thank you.

896
01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:19.500
Thank you.

897
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.500
Thank you.

898
01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:23.500
Thank you.

899
01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:25.500
Thank you.

900
01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:27.500
Thank you.

901
01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:29.500
Thank you.

902
01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:31.500
Thank you.

903
01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:33.500
Thank you.

904
01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.500
Thank you.

905
01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:37.500
Thank you.

906
01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:39.500
Thank you.

907
01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:41.500
Thank you.

908
01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:43.500
Thank you.

909
01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:45.500
Thank you.

910
01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:47.500
Thank you.

911
01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:49.500
Thank you.

912
01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:51.500
Thank you.

913
01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:53.500
Thank you.

914
01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:55.500
Thank you.

915
01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:57.500
Thank you.

916
01:39:57.500 --> 01:39:59.500
Thank you.

917
01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:01.500
Thank you.

918
01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:03.500
Thank you.

919
01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:05.500
Thank you.

920
01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:07.500
Thank you.

921
01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:09.500
Thank you.

922
01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:11.500
Thank you.

923
01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:13.500
Thank you.

924
01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:16.000
So two o'clock has arrived.

925
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:37.000
That means we can jump into our other representative silver bill, CACR 27, which is providing that all state court judges shall be subject to recall and removal by petition and vote of registered voters pursuant to provisions established by the legislature.

926
01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Chair would welcome Representative Silver to provide testimony.

927
01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Welcome.

928
01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:49.500
Thank you Mr Chairman, and thank you to the members of the committee.

929
01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:51.500
The issue...

930
01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:56.000
Excuse me, can you remind us where you are?

931
01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:06.500
I'm sorry, I'm a state representative from Belknap County District 2, towns of Guilford and Meredith, and I live in Guilford.

932
01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:08.500
Thank you.

933
01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:12.000
And this is my second non-consecutive term.

934
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:39.000
The issue being addressed by this is an issue brought to my attention by various and sundry constituents who complain with all sorts of stories and horror stories, complaints about their treatment by judicial officers in the court system in the state, most of whom are complaining about how they're treated in family court.

935
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:48.500
Some in divorce situations, some dealing with child custody, child removals, DCYF stuff that's going on, etc cetera, whatever.

936
01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:56.500
So basically, I did some research, and I looked into how do we deal with judges?

937
01:41:56.500 --> 01:42:08.000
How do judges get appointed, and how long do they serve, and how do we get rid of them if we want to?

938
01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:17.000
So as we probably know, judges are appointed by the governor and then confirmed by the executive council.

939
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:31.500
And once they're confirmed by the executive council, which probably rubber stamps most of the judicial appointments, I would assume, they serve until they age out at age 70.

940
01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:57.500
So we end up with a situation, for example, which is a story for another day, basically, but a side story, where you have an excellent Chief Justice of our state Supreme Court, Bob Lynn, who aged out, but now we're fortunate enough that we brought him back as a state representative.

941
01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:59.500
That's a different story.

942
01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:15.500
So in the history of our state, the only way, or the current law is the only way that a judge can be removed from office is by the process of impeachment.

943
01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:32.500
Impeachment is a drastic remedy, almost never attempted to be used, and in the history of our state has only been used a very few times, probably less than the fingers on one hand.

944
01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:38.500
So I looked into how other states have dealt with this issue.

945
01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:57.000
I have a handout which I'll give to all the representatives that basically provides, does a sort of a recap of all the abilities of states that have provisions for the recall of government officials and officers.

946
01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Right now, there are 40 states that have law provisions allowing for the recall of officials.

947
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:08.500
And there's a whole variety of ways.

948
01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:10.500
There's specific provisions.

949
01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:17.500
This gives a detail, literally state by state by state, which states have provisions.

950
01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:34.000
I recall a number of years ago, there was a Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court who came under fire because she never would approve lower court's imposition of the death penalty.

951
01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:39.500
And she had several members of the court sided with her.

952
01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:43.000
And this stirred up a hornet's nest.

953
01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:49.000
And California, I guess we all know, is notorious for doing recalls.

954
01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.000
They recalled governors in the past.

955
01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.500
Sometimes they have been successful, sometimes not.

956
01:44:55.500 --> 01:45:11.000
But in the case of Rose Bird, who was the chief justice out in California, she and some of her acolytes on the Supreme Court were in fact recalled and replaced.

957
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:15.500
So there's different ways of dealing with the issue.

958
01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:36.000
Right now, the citizens of our state have basically, essentially, no practical way to remove judges whose behavior they might think is improper, but doesn't rise to this supreme level that might justify impeachment and might actually be successful at impeachment.

959
01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:47.500
So essentially we have a situation with state court judges, many of whom are excellent, but some of whom are not so excellent.

960
01:45:47.500 --> 01:46:08.000
But neither category of those judges has any responsibility, or they're not responsible to the people of the state who pay their salaries through taxes and who then have to subject themselves to going before them for adjudication of their rights.

961
01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:36.000
So what the CACR 27 does, it provides in the Constitution that state court judges shall be subject to recall and removal by petition and vote of the registered voters pursuant to provisions which the general court has to, once this would be passed, then implementing legislation would need to be adopted by the general court.

962
01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
So the specifics.

963
01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:50.000
And so what I'd like to do, if I might, is to pass out this reprint of the summary of the laws governing recall.

964
01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
May I, Mr.

965
01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Chair?

966
01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Certainly.

967
01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
recall may I mr.

968
01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
chair certainly Wikipedia Wikipedia?

969
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.500
No, no, this is Ballotpedia.

970
01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:04.500
This is Ballotpedia.

971
01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:11.500
And just once, you know, if it's on the internet, it must be true.

972
01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:14.000
We all know that, right?

973
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.500
So here's some extras for those that didn't show.

974
01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:22.500
In case they actually want to read it.

975
01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:24.500
So basically, that's it.

976
01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:34.500
It basically puts a provision in the Constitution that gives a pathway for the removal of judges short of impeachment.

977
01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:36.500
It's pretty simple.

978
01:47:36.500 --> 01:47:46.000
And then we have to figure out the actual mechanics, looking at how it's been done in other states.

979
01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:52.500
There's different combinations and permutations of how the different states have done it.

980
01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:54.500
And that's basically it.

981
01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:57.000
So I'm open for questions.

982
01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.500
Thank you very much for your testimony.

983
01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:02.500
I see one question.

984
01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:04.500
Representative.

985
01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:06.500
Thank you, Mr.

986
01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:08.500
Chairman.

987
01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:12.500
And thank you for your testimony today, Representative.

988
01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:19.000
Are you aware that in New Hampshire we have the Judicial Conduct Committee?

989
01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Yes.

990
01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Follow up, Mr.

991
01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Chairman?

992
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Absolutely.

993
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Are you aware that anybody can file a complaint with the Judicial Conduct Committee?

994
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Yes.

995
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Follow up.

996
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:47.500
Why is it that you would go to a recall and overstep anything that the Judicial Conduct Committee does?

997
01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:53.500
I'm not familiar with the exact makeup of the Judicial Conduct Committee.

998
01:48:53.500 --> 01:49:03.500
I'm assuming that it is comprised either exclusively or substantially by either other judges or lawyers or a combination thereof.

999
01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:10.500
So to some extent, it's the guild mentality that protects its own, I believe.

1000
01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:57.000
That would would be my feeling and that's the feeling of many of my constituents that you know if a problem if they have a problem with a judge and raise a complaint the the judges and lawyers in the state sort of gather around and circle the wagons and try to be very protective of the judges and I'm'm not sure, I haven't looked into what actions have been taken by the Judicial Conduct Committee, but I have not heard of very many judges being removed or suspended or anything like that.

1001
01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:06.000
I could just admit that I don't have any numbers on that, and maybe they have done so.

1002
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:20.500
But all this does is it places not in some committee that meets in secret, but it puts in the hands of the voters the ability to do this.

1003
01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:23.500
It wouldn't be an easy process.

1004
01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:26.000
It's not an easy process.

1005
01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:33.000
As witnessed, the California recall, the recent recall attempts of their governor, which failed.

1006
01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.500
They had a recall, and it failed.

1007
01:50:36.500 --> 01:50:39.500
So it's not an easy process.

1008
01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:42.500
There are alternatives to this process.

1009
01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:48.500
I discussed with one of the lobbyists while we were on break.

1010
01:50:48.500 --> 01:51:16.500
There is what's called the Missouri Plan, which is that judges who go through the appointment process assume the mantle of being a judge, that every six years or some other specific term have to run in an election before the voters, what's called a retention election, that says, shall justice so-and-so be retained, yes, no.

1011
01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:28.500
And when those have been held in many states, it's very unusual that a judge actually gets removed under a Missouri plan retention vote.

1012
01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:53.000
But it's available that's just an alternative but this is this is something basically putting in the hands of the voters my constituents who are very upset about their treatment in the judicial system and I say that as a member of the bars of New Hampshire and Florida.

1013
01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Representative Spedia.

1014
01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Thank you Mr.

1015
01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.500
Chair and thank you for your testimony.

1016
01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:02.500
So, Mr.

1017
01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:06.000
Chair, and thank you for your testimony.

1018
01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:22.000
So would, just like, you know, we had a special, if it was a recall election, would that fall into the kind of similar rules that the special elections would go under?

1019
01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
I'm sorry?

1020
01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:30.500
If it's, you know, if it's a recall, we had to recall somebody.

1021
01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:35.500
We got the petitions and we're going to recall them.

1022
01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:40.500
Does that election then go before like a special election?

1023
01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:43.500
The Executive Council makes the decision?

1024
01:52:43.500 --> 01:53:03.500
It would be based, the specific procedure would have to be set forth in an RSA that we have to adopt if this constitutional amendment, because the constitutional amendment says the procedures have to be set by the general court.

1025
01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:06.000
So we can set it.

1026
01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:23.500
Now, I don't think it would, personally, I don't think it would be a good idea to have a recall election of a judge mixed in with a town election or a general election, etc.

1027
01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:38.500
Sounds to me, would seem to me be more reasonable to have it as a special election, but that's really up to the general court to decide in implementing legislation.

1028
01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:46.500
So the answer is, I don't, you know, nothing is decided, it will be decided later.

1029
01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:48.500
Senator Roulard.

1030
01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:50.500
Thank you.

1031
01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:57.000
What's the process in New Hampshire right now for removal of a judge?

1032
01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Impeachment.

1033
01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:05.000
How many impeachments have we had in the state of New Hampshire?

1034
01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Two.

1035
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Two?

1036
01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Thank you.

1037
01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:16.000
I was aware of one, I thought it was two.

1038
01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.500
Dan, he says it's two.

1039
01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:20.500
Follow up.

1040
01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:26.500
And do you know how one or both actually came to fruition?

1041
01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:32.500
Well, if you don't know the answer, just say you don't know.

1042
01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:41.500
Yeah, we'll wait until you- I don't know the answer, but I thought it was one or two.

1043
01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:52.500
Representative Itzi, former Representative Itzi, is really the constitutional scholar and stuff like this, and is sort of the font of knowledge.

1044
01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:54.500
Thank you.

1045
01:54:54.500 --> 01:55:25.500
Thank you Any I have a couple of questions if you don't mind So I'm looking on on the bottom of Well, I guess it's just the first page of this on line 27, and it talks about the governor with consent of the council may remove any commissioned officer for reasonable cause upon the address of both houses of the legislature.

1046
01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:30.000
That's not the impeachment that we're talking about, correct?

1047
01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Correct.

1048
01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:37.500
Do you know what the reasonable cause, if that's defined anywhere?

1049
01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:39.500
Probably not.

1050
01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:52.000
It's sort of like in the federal Constitution impeachment for high crimes and misdemeanors and the courts have said it's whatever Congress says it means.

1051
01:55:52.000 --> 01:56:04.500
Whenever you have those things, things like reasonable cause or cause or just cause, it's whatever the governing body who's applying it says it means.

1052
01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:07.500
Because it does go on further.

1053
01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:14.000
It says, shall not be a cause which is sufficient ground for impeachment.

1054
01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Right.

1055
01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.500
So it's a separate remedy.

1056
01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:20.500
Separate from impeachment.

1057
01:56:20.500 --> 01:56:28.000
So that's different than the impeachment that you said would be the only remedy, correct?

1058
01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Correct.

1059
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
So I stand correct.

1060
01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:39.500
So there is an alternative remedy, but what I'm providing now is another alternative remedy.

1061
01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:41.500
Okay.

1062
01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:49.000
What I'm wondering about is the wording of the voter's guide to implement this CACR.

1063
01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:58.500
It's it's basically asking the people if they would agree that the legislature should make up rules on this.

1064
01:56:58.500 --> 01:57:00.500
Yes.

1065
01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:02.500
Correct?

1066
01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:04.500
Correct.

1067
01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:06.500
Yes.

1068
01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:16.000
It's not outlining what those rules or what those people, what judges or commissioned officers would be removed for.

1069
01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:22.000
It's only saying, should we create a process for this to happen?

1070
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Correct.

1071
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:29.000
It's up to the general court to do implementing legislation.

1072
01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Okay.

1073
01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Thank you very much.

1074
01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Any further anywhere?

1075
01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
No.

1076
01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Thank you again for your testimony.

1077
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.500
Thank you for your attention.

1078
01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:44.500
Next up would be...

1079
01:57:44.500 --> 01:57:46.500
Help me with this.

1080
01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:48.500
Richard Garingo.

1081
01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:50.500
you tell me.

1082
01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:52.500
How's that?

1083
01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:54.500
I will.

1084
01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:56.500
I'm used to it.

1085
01:57:56.500 --> 01:57:58.500
It's a hard name.

1086
01:57:58.500 --> 01:58:00.500
Thank you.

1087
01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:03.000
My name is Richard Guerriero.

1088
01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.500
I'm an attorney here in New Hampshire.

1089
01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:19.000
I have offices in Keene and in Concord and the reason I'm here today is that I'm the president of the New Hampshire Bar Association.

1090
01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:23.500
So I'm speaking on behalf of the Bar Association.

1091
01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:25.500
Welcome to Legi Admin.

1092
01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:36.000
I think the first thing I will tell you is that, you know, our Bar Association has over 5,000 active attorneys.

1093
01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:41.500
And we have a legislation committee that studies legislation like this.

1094
01:58:41.500 --> 01:59:17.000
and we a Board of Governors that represents all of those attorneys both from particular counties and at large and I wanted to tell you that our legislation committee unanimously opposes this effort CA CR 27 and the Board of Governors although we got kind of late, every member that I was able to get to vote last night, almost all of them, they all voted unanimously in opposition of this.

1095
01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:27.500
So if you take nothing else away from what I say, the New Hampshire Bar Association strongly opposes this proposal, okay?

1096
01:59:27.500 --> 01:59:31.500
Now the reasons for that are pretty straightforward.

1097
01:59:31.500 --> 02:00:08.000
We see this as an effort that would politicize judicial decisions and court cases and we think that that is not proper judges should I think all of us would agree decide cases on the law and the facts and if judges are thinking about or pressured by efforts to remove them from office because of their actions in particular cases, that will politicize their position, which is not what our Constitution intends.

1098
02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:17.000
It is important that there be remedies for the isolated cases where judges are far out of line.

1099
02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:26.000
The normal remedy, which we all know about and you all know about, is you appeal the decision.

1100
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:35.000
You appeal to the Supreme Court and they correct that decision and we have good Supreme Court justices.

1101
02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:38.000
That's how we correct those decisions.

1102
02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:48.500
Where you have instances of misconduct by a judge, we do have the Judicial Conduct Committee and that is very active.

1103
02:00:48.500 --> 02:01:08.000
I mean frankly, you don't have to go beyond the front pages of the union leader in the last six or eight months to know that the Judicial Conduct Committee is active and in contact with the attorney general.

1104
02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:15.000
And when a judge is out of line, they do take the necessary action.

1105
02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:34.000
In regard to the comments earlier, I did want to note for you because, I mean, honestly, I would be concerned if the Judicial Conduct Committee was all lawyers, and I would feel like it was inside baseball.

1106
02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:43.000
But I know it's not all lawyers because as president of the bar, I just appointed a non-lawyer.

1107
02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:49.500
And number two, if you look at the makeup, I'll just read there.

1108
02:01:49.500 --> 02:02:06.000
There's one public member and one alternate member appointed by the president of the New Hampshire Bar Association who is not a judge, attorney, clerk of court, or elected or appointed public official.

1109
02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:13.000
The Supreme Court appoints, again, another member who is not an attorney, judge, etc.

1110
02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:16.000
The governor appoints two public members.

1111
02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:23.500
The president of the Senate appoints one, and the speaker of the House appoints one.

1112
02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:29.500
So the non-attorney public is substantially represented on the Judicial Conduct Committee.

1113
02:02:29.500 --> 02:02:45.500
And I don't want to go on forever, but the bottom line is we feel like through the appeal process and through the Judicial Conduct Committee, these concerns are all adequately addressed.

1114
02:02:45.500 --> 02:02:50.000
There's no reason to politicize the role of judges.

1115
02:02:50.000 --> 02:03:18.000
You know, that would go against the framework that is set up in the Constitution, that judges are supposed to be appointed, they're appointed for life or until 70 for a reason, so they can make decisions without political pressure and follow the law and the facts and not be subject to that kind of influence.

1116
02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:30.000
And the last thing I will note, I didn't intend to add this, but I'll add, I mean, there is a significant vetting process.

1117
02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:39.500
I mean, just to speak plain English about it, I mean, Chuck Douglas is on the Judicial Selection Commission.

1118
02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:41.500
He runs that.

1119
02:03:41.500 --> 02:03:54.500
Only people that get through that are people that are fair and reasonably competent, and they're going to do the job that they're supposed to do.

1120
02:03:54.500 --> 02:04:04.500
And then almost every nominee comes before the Board of Governors at the Bar Association, and we issue a recommendation.

1121
02:04:04.500 --> 02:04:09.000
And it's not true that they're a rubber stamp.

1122
02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:26.500
In fact, we issued a recommendation earlier this year where we recommended that the person was qualified with reservations, and that person ended up withdrawing their application to be a judge before the Executive Council.

1123
02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:29.500
So it's not a rubber stamp.

1124
02:04:29.500 --> 02:04:31.500
Thank you.

1125
02:04:31.500 --> 02:05:00.000
with reservations and that person ended up withdrawing their their application to be a judge before the executive council so it's not a rubber stamp and we think the process works fine the way it is so I'll take any questions you have thank you for your testimony are there questions yes representative Simon thank you mr.

1126
02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:15.500
chair thank you for taking my question just for those of us who don't know, the Judicial Conduct Committee, you say that it will take the necessary actions for whatever's happening.

1127
02:05:15.500 --> 02:05:18.500
What is the scope of that?

1128
02:05:18.500 --> 02:05:26.500
What might be the ramifications if a judge steps out of line from the board's perspective?

1129
02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:36.000
Well, I mean, it is true that it would have to go to impeachment if it got that far.

1130
02:05:36.000 --> 02:06:21.500
I mean, as a practical matter, and it's just honestly just my recollection and recent experience if it gets to a certain point where the judge is being severely disciplined they typically resign you know if they're sanctioned in some way but I think that I mean ultimately the New Hampshire Supreme Court has authority there and then and so you know the Judicial Conduct Committee can make a recommendation, take actions, take the person off a particular case, reprimand the judge or whatever and I think refer it for impeachment.

1131
02:06:21.500 --> 02:06:23.500
Thank you.

1132
02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:25.500
Further questions?

1133
02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:28.000
So I have a couple.

1134
02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:35.000
So you mentioned how some of the non-public people are appointed to that commission.

1135
02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:39.500
How many total do they represent out of the?

1136
02:06:39.500 --> 02:06:42.500
I honestly can't answer that way.

1137
02:06:42.500 --> 02:06:46.000
I don't remember the number right now.

1138
02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:51.000
I mean, I could literally look it up for you.

1139
02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
We can supplement it.

1140
02:06:53.000 --> 02:07:01.500
But if you said you thought it was, and it seems like it's probably half and half.

1141
02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:06.000
It may be slightly heavier towards judges and lawyers.

1142
02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:09.000
I honestly don't remember the numbers.

1143
02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Okay.

1144
02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:18.000
I would grant you that it's influenced by the, somebody probably looked at that.

1145
02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.500
I would grant you that.

1146
02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:29.000
I mean, look, it's a judicial conduct committee with a bunch of judges and attorneys on it.

1147
02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:33.500
They have a heavy influence I would grant that.

1148
02:07:33.500 --> 02:07:35.500
Okay.

1149
02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:46.500
So the average age that someone would be first appointed as a judge is that is there is it 30s 40s 50s?

1150
02:07:46.500 --> 02:08:03.500
You know I don't know the average age I mean I it's just my personal experience that most governors try to appoint people where their appointment will be on the bench for a while.

1151
02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:13.500
But just in the last, we've had, at least in my experience, an extraordinary number of judicial appointments this year.

1152
02:08:13.500 --> 02:08:25.000
I think the Bar Association has vetted 15 or 16 people, which is more than the entire five or six years before that.

1153
02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:37.000
and I think the Bar Association has vetted 15 or 16 people, which is more than the entire five or six years before that.

1154
02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:41.500
And I think one of them was early 40s.

1155
02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:50.500
And one of the recent ones we vetted, which I was kind of surprised, he was over 60.

1156
02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:59.000
I was like, well, you're going to appoint him on the bench for seven or eight years.

1157
02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:03.000
But, you know, I don't make the appointments.

1158
02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:07.000
We just say whether or not they're qualified.

1159
02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:18.000
So it's a pretty big range but if you said you know late 40s early 50s I think that'd be about right.

1160
02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Okay.

1161
02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:44.500
Does that, so that means that you know if we said 50 theoretically they would be there for 20 years which would sound about right to you I guess yeah and during that time period they have essentially free reign aside from the Judicial Conduct Committee is that fair?

1162
02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:49.000
Well and the appeal of, which is really important.

1163
02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:53.000
The appeal of their decisions to another court.

1164
02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Right.

1165
02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.000
So, and that's, you know, I mean, that's...

1166
02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:03.000
But that's their decision rather than their profession.

1167
02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:08.500
You mean in terms of personal misconduct or something like that?

1168
02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:10.500
Yes, that's right.

1169
02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:12.500
Okay.

1170
02:10:12.500 --> 02:10:22.500
And so that's really what the prime sponsor is trying to address, is that personal conduct rather than their actions?

1171
02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:25.000
Is that fair to say?

1172
02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.500
I'm not asking you to...

1173
02:10:27.500 --> 02:10:30.000
I think that's probably right.

1174
02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:33.000
I mean, it's also my experience.

1175
02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:50.500
I mean, the reality is that some of the most painful cases that people have to deal with in court are custody cases and divorce cases, and that's why a lot of these complaints arise.

1176
02:10:50.500 --> 02:11:07.500
And you should also, I mean, the Professional Conduct Committee for Lawyers gets a huge number of complaints against lawyers handling divorce cases because people are so upset and feelings are running so deep.

1177
02:11:07.500 --> 02:11:18.000
And I totally understand that depth of that reaction when it comes to custody and divorce and that sort of thing.

1178
02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:28.000
But I do think it's telling that you don't see those complaints so much in other areas of the law.

1179
02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:44.500
And so it makes me think that this is really more attributable to the emotional nature and the importance, you know, personally for people of those cases than some systemic problem with judges.

1180
02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:46.500
Thank you.

1181
02:11:46.500 --> 02:11:48.500
I appreciate that.

1182
02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:59.000
Is it your belief that the states that do have this type of recall provision are more politicized because of that?

1183
02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
It is.

1184
02:12:01.000 --> 02:13:32.500
And I will speak from personal experience it's I hate to say it but ancient personal experience I came here from Louisiana so I've been practicing here almost 30 years and I've been practicing almost 40 years the first eight or nine ten years I practiced in Baton Rouge and New Orleans and I had a private practice where we were in a system with elected judges and you know I'm not saying there is anything morally wrong or terrible about that but I can tell you I didn't like it when somebody was running for judge asking me for money in a political campaign and we I felt like I'm going to be appearing in front of these judges I have to give money and honestly I'll tell you exactly what I did it's so old I gave the same amount to every viable candidate if there was an opening I'll just give a pick how much I had and I would divide it and I'd give the same amount to each one because I couldn't think of anything else to do.

1185
02:13:32.500 --> 02:13:39.500
It just seems like to me it has no place in the judicial process.

1186
02:13:39.500 --> 02:13:56.500
We should appoint a person who's competent, who has the integrity and the ability, and represents the community in a way that they can apply the law to the facts and be above politics.

1187
02:13:56.500 --> 02:14:34.500
And I think if we go down this road, if we started having elections related to judges, judges then you're not gonna you're gonna have that politicization of the process thank you for your testimony any one one final sure um so just looking at the bill in front of us I see it as basically being dealing more with the pulling people out of their positions rather than how a new person would be reinstated.

1188
02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:49.500
So as far as the political, I mean, I could be reading that incorrectly, but it's you know, taking a judge who's showing misconduct, taking them out of their position.

1189
02:14:49.500 --> 02:14:52.500
I don't think anything's been said.

1190
02:14:52.500 --> 02:14:57.500
Am I incorrect as far as how they'd be reinstated?

1191
02:14:57.500 --> 02:15:03.000
I thought it authorized the general court to create a process.

1192
02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:07.000
Well, we would be creating a process, right.

1193
02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:47.500
So my question is, in your testimony at the end there, you had said in cases where states hold elections and people are asking for financial funds, would you feel more comfortable, not that you feel comfortable with it, but do you think it would be just as politicized if the governor would then reappoint another person, let's say, and it would have to be approved by the executive council, but it wouldn't actually go to the public for a vote.

1194
02:15:47.500 --> 02:15:52.500
I think there's a whole host of unanswered questions there.

1195
02:15:52.500 --> 02:15:55.500
So, I mean, here's an example.

1196
02:15:55.500 --> 02:16:01.000
Suppose there's a recall election or a vote for a judge.

1197
02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:09.500
Does that judge have a First Amendment right to campaign and say, I should not be recalled?

1198
02:16:09.500 --> 02:16:16.500
And then do voters have a First Amendment right to donate to that judge?

1199
02:16:16.500 --> 02:16:23.000
And then, so then what about litigants and lawyers who donate to that?

1200
02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:29.500
I mean, it's just a can of worms, to be frank about it.

1201
02:16:29.500 --> 02:16:45.000
That, for good reason, I think the Bar Association opposes it, and I'm one of those on the Board of Governors who voted to oppose it for that kind of reason.

1202
02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:51.500
It's just, haven't dealt with, and I think we shouldn't deal with it.

1203
02:16:51.500 --> 02:17:04.000
And even if it's only on the recall and not on the vote on the replacement, how do you avoid these issues that come up?

1204
02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:25.000
And any time you say the voters are going to come out and vote, then the voters have rights, and the person who is involved in the vote has rights, and you involve other constitutional provisions, the First Amendment and due process.

1205
02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:38.000
And, I mean, the only thing I could say, it might be more work for attorneys, which I'm not sure you're in the business of endorsing.

1206
02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
So, you know.

1207
02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:43.000
No, thank you for that clarification.

1208
02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Appreciate it.

1209
02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Thank you.

1210
02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
That's all I see.

1211
02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.500
Thank you for your testimony.

1212
02:17:51.500 --> 02:17:53.500
Thank you.

1213
02:17:53.500 --> 02:18:15.500
I did submit written testimony as well you did okay thank you great thank you very much last pink card that I see here is Honorable Dan it's a who's still from Manchester thank you sir and speaking in in support of the bill.

1214
02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:27.000
And that support is questionable for a lot of the reasons just voiced to the politics and the election nature for a judge.

1215
02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:32.000
But there are two reasons I really wanted to testify.

1216
02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:36.000
One was as to the Judicial Conduct Committee.

1217
02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:41.500
And they cannot do really anything more than sanction a judge.

1218
02:18:41.500 --> 02:18:51.500
They can give them a vacation, they can fine them, but they cannot take them out of play per se.

1219
02:18:51.500 --> 02:18:54.500
They can't remove them from office.

1220
02:18:54.500 --> 02:18:59.000
Even the Supreme Court can't remove them from office.

1221
02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:07.000
There's only one body that can remove them from office right now, and that's the legislature.

1222
02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:10.500
The two provisions for removal from office.

1223
02:19:10.500 --> 02:19:13.500
One is, as you know, impeachment.

1224
02:19:13.500 --> 02:19:17.000
That is for actions in your office.

1225
02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:20.500
Bribery, corruption, malpractice, or maladministration in office.

1226
02:19:20.500 --> 02:19:24.000
So in the conduct of their duties.

1227
02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:38.500
And that's primarily what you'd be seeing here because you've got, you know, these are because people feel they've been aggrieved, denied due process, whatever in the judicial process.

1228
02:19:38.500 --> 02:19:47.500
That applies to any officer of the state and so it doesn't have to be a commissioned officer.

1229
02:19:47.500 --> 02:19:56.000
In my opinion it could float down to the towns, which are political subdivisions of the state.

1230
02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Why would the legislature allow an evil person to remain as a selectman or whatever, who was abusing the people?

1231
02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:10.500
The other method of removal is Bill of Address.

1232
02:20:10.500 --> 02:20:14.500
Bill of Address is limited to commissioned officers.

1233
02:20:14.500 --> 02:20:33.500
So it applies to certain of the department heads, it applies to judges, military officers, and it says in there, as Representative Hill correctly pointed out, that it is for those things for which you cannot be impeached.

1234
02:20:33.500 --> 02:20:37.500
So it's for actions outside of your office.

1235
02:20:37.500 --> 02:20:41.000
It might be for womanizing or drunkenness.

1236
02:20:41.000 --> 02:21:14.500
I can't remember the particular offices involved, but at the time I think it was sheriff, and then the person got a gubernatorial commission and this is like in the 1950s and they were removed by bill of address from their commissioned office for actions that they executed as sheriff Because it was felt to make them unfit for office So that's that's the interplay over there.

1237
02:21:14.500 --> 02:21:24.000
I do think that something needs to be done because in my opinion the family court is a mess.

1238
02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:36.500
Yes it does deal with highly emotional situations but the family court has very little in the way of fixed laws within which they operate.

1239
02:21:36.500 --> 02:21:48.500
And that has, and yes they have court rules, but the judge has the power to waive those rules in the interest of justice.

1240
02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:55.000
So rule one is there are no rules unless the judge wants them.

1241
02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Thank you.

1242
02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
interest of justice.

1243
02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:05.500
So rule one is there are no rules unless the judge wants them.

1244
02:22:05.500 --> 02:22:10.000
That has led to a lot of discretionary action.

1245
02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:21.500
My efforts as a legislator were to put as much as I could into statute so that that it had to be followed.

1246
02:22:21.500 --> 02:22:29.000
I think you need to look at this, I think you need to consider it.

1247
02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:33.500
I think there's a lot of issues with this.

1248
02:22:33.500 --> 02:22:46.500
If the judge in question is a district court or family court judge that practices in Portsmouth, over what universe do you have the recall election?

1249
02:22:46.500 --> 02:22:52.000
Certainly somebody over in Hillsborough County should be voting on it.

1250
02:22:52.000 --> 02:23:05.000
Probably somebody in western Rockingham County has no interest in the and the people who would be voting over there have no knowledge of the situation.

1251
02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:12.000
So there are a lot of logistical issues that you would have to consider.

1252
02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:18.000
I guess that's it I'd happy be happy to take any questions.

1253
02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.500
Thank you for your testimony.

1254
02:23:20.500 --> 02:23:22.500
Are there questions?

1255
02:23:22.500 --> 02:23:24.500
I have one.

1256
02:23:24.500 --> 02:23:35.000
So it sounds to me while you're in favor of the concept, you're not convinced that ACACR is the correct pathway?

1257
02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:48.500
Or is it more you're not sure that the Judicial Conduct Committee is the correct method of addressing the problems you see in family court or whatever.

1258
02:23:48.500 --> 02:23:50.500
Can you clarify that?

1259
02:23:50.500 --> 02:23:52.500
Yeah, I can.

1260
02:23:52.500 --> 02:24:05.500
One, if you're going to have any method of removal other than impeachment or bill of address you would have to amend the Constitution, that's clear.

1261
02:24:05.500 --> 02:24:22.000
I think you would have to have a very well thought out plan before you did that because once you amend the Constitution then you have to take action to execute that amendment.

1262
02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:30.500
So even if you wanted to give the Judicial Conduct Committee some extraordinary power to remove judges.

1263
02:24:30.500 --> 02:24:35.000
You couldn't do it till you amended the Constitution.

1264
02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:45.000
I think the real issue at hand is a greater scrutiny of the courts and that's up to you guys.

1265
02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
Thank you.

1266
02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
By statute or?

1267
02:24:49.000 --> 02:25:00.000
Well, the first thing to do, in my opinion, would be to pass a House resolution creating an investigation of the courts.

1268
02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:04.000
That's how an impeachment typically initiates, for instance.

1269
02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
You create a committee.

1270
02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:17.500
This is from, okay, I was not yet in the House, but I was in politics at the time of the Brock situation.

1271
02:25:17.500 --> 02:25:37.000
It began as a bill of address, which it really shouldn't have been because everything was in the course of duties, but the bill of address raised enough issues that the House passed a resolution to investigate the situation.

1272
02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:43.000
That investigation turned up the issues that justified or instigated the impeachment.

1273
02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:47.000
And that was the other, the two impeachments.

1274
02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:52.000
One was Justice Brock in 1998 I believe, 98-99 99.

1275
02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:56.500
And the other one was, I believe, in 1794.

1276
02:25:56.500 --> 02:26:11.500
It was a judge who had been elected to Congress, which is an incompatible office, and he was refusing to resign his judgeship, which he held by Constitution until 70.

1277
02:26:11.500 --> 02:26:18.500
And when the impeachment got lodged, he he resigned and it all went away.

1278
02:26:18.500 --> 02:26:27.500
But you're you're describing situations where it has worked already through the legislature by a bill of address.

1279
02:26:27.500 --> 02:26:36.500
Well really it should be by impeachment and you do it first by passing a resolution to investigate.

1280
02:26:36.500 --> 02:26:39.000
But again through the legislature.

1281
02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
Through the legislature.

1282
02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:45.000
That's actually particularly through the House of Representatives.

1283
02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:50.000
The House of Representatives is styled as the grand inquest.

1284
02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:55.500
You would also call it the grand jury of the state.

1285
02:26:55.500 --> 02:27:25.500
So it's the House who has the duty to investigate actions of the judiciary or members of the executive as to whether or not there's anything to impeach for and if they find it then it would they be they who introduced the bill of impeachment which is the indictment which then goes before the Senate to convict or not.

1286
02:27:25.500 --> 02:27:32.000
But all of that is done without any changes made to the Constitution.

1287
02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
Absolutely.

1288
02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:39.500
So is a constitutional amendment necessary in order to get at?

1289
02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:41.500
Absolutely not.

1290
02:27:41.500 --> 02:27:43.500
Just requires resolve.

1291
02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:49.500
So you were in favor of it before you were against it?

1292
02:27:49.500 --> 02:27:52.500
Well, this is a different issue.

1293
02:27:52.500 --> 02:28:06.000
This is giving the people, would give the people a path to take should they not be able to inspire their representatives to protect them from government.

1294
02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:11.500
And where does the redress of grievances come in on this?

1295
02:28:11.500 --> 02:28:13.500
That's entirely separate.

1296
02:28:13.500 --> 02:28:15.500
Okay, okay.

1297
02:28:15.500 --> 02:28:17.500
I'm set.

1298
02:28:17.500 --> 02:28:20.500
Anyone, did I stir up anything?

1299
02:28:20.500 --> 02:28:22.500
No?

1300
02:28:22.500 --> 02:28:54.000
sorry thank you for your testimony look at that I have no other pink cards does everyone have any other things to say no good closing the hearing then on 27 and we can jump immediately into CACR 29, which is providing that the number of representatives to be no more than 150 and the number of senators be no more than 35.

1301
02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:57.000
And for that I have one.

1302
02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:05.500
Do we have a, oh, yep, we have the prime sponsor, who is Representative Connolly before us.

1303
02:29:05.500 --> 02:29:08.000
Welcome to the legislative administration.

1304
02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Thank you, Mr.

1305
02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Chairman, committee members.

1306
02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:15.000
Casey Connolly, State Representative from Dover.

1307
02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:18.000
I represent Stratford County District 13.

1308
02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:22.000
And here now to talk about CACR 29.

1309
02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:30.000
So before I start, I should say that I have the utmost respect for this body.

1310
02:29:30.000 --> 02:30:04.500
But we're talking about changing it, so it's that this is an improvement this is not meant as a criticism of the process or any member or anything like that this is truly about one person's thought about how it could be improved so that's the that's the preamble so like I said this is about good government it's about raising the bar for public service in New Hampshire.

1311
02:30:04.500 --> 02:30:08.500
And it's about paying legislators for their time.

1312
02:30:08.500 --> 02:30:15.500
This is work, and it should be treated that way and compensated as such.

1313
02:30:15.500 --> 02:30:21.000
The CACR would fairly significantly restructure the size of the legislature.

1314
02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:25.500
The title of the bill represents an old version.

1315
02:30:25.500 --> 02:30:31.500
It's actually no more than 200 is what's contemplated under this bill.

1316
02:30:31.500 --> 02:30:47.000
This was a revision during the drafting process So anyway, so that just so I'm clear the title has not changed but the The guts of the bill has changed mr.

1317
02:30:47.000 --> 02:31:02.500
Chairman, that's correct That was I don't know if that's an oversight or if that's the standard process but the title did not evolve when the text of the bill changed.

1318
02:31:02.500 --> 02:31:12.500
I see yeah I see it on so everyone's aware on line 8 of the bill no more than 200.

1319
02:31:12.500 --> 02:31:20.000
Anyway continuing with that thread so instead So instead of 400 seats, there'd be 200.

1320
02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Instead of 24 Senate seats, there'd be 35.

1321
02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Currently, there's about one representative for every 3,400 residents of our state.

1322
02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:43.000
And roughly one for Senator for every 57,000 people under this proposal would be about 6,800 residents per house member, 39,000 or so residents per senator.

1323
02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:53.500
So still pretty representative and very similar to states on both sides of us, Maine, Vermont, as far as that ratio.

1324
02:31:53.500 --> 02:32:30.500
So I do this, as I said earlier, it's about raising the bar and raising the standard for for this house on any session day there are anywhere between 10 and 20 percent of our members not present we have committee members who never show up ever there are or when i first ran for this seat i did so in a special election because nobody else wanted to in my district in Dover.

1325
02:32:30.500 --> 02:32:36.500
We have seats across the state that nobody signs up for, period.

1326
02:32:36.500 --> 02:32:43.500
And this is every election every year, and not just in one-party control seats.

1327
02:32:43.500 --> 02:32:48.000
And it would reduce the number of bad bills.

1328
02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:53.500
And by bad, I don't mean bills I don't agree with.

1329
02:32:53.500 --> 02:33:26.000
I mean bills that aren't fully formed, weren't thought through um bills that all of us see repeatedly at our committees that um end up in the consent calendar 21 to 0 against and i would allow members to get to know one another potentially reducing the rancor it's easy to um it's a little easier to misbehave when you're in a group of 400.

1330
02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:43.000
If you know the members and you have some personal experience with them, it's a lot harder to, frankly, act, to see what we saw at the last House session, to be real honest.

1331
02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:54.500
And it would reduce the influence of lobbyists because members would have a chance to gain some expertise in more than one subject.

1332
02:33:54.500 --> 02:34:00.500
So along those same lines, this work should not be a hobby.

1333
02:34:00.500 --> 02:34:04.000
It should not be a volunteer job.

1334
02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:20.500
Under the current structure, $100 a year makes it so that vast swaths of our state, they can't even run for this, let alone serve, because they have to work, they have family.

1335
02:34:20.500 --> 02:34:28.500
What is contemplated here is a pretty nominal salary, $6,000 for House members, 7,500 for senators.

1336
02:34:28.500 --> 02:34:35.000
That's roughly based on $25 an hour for roughly 200 hours of work.

1337
02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:38.000
So that's where that came from.

1338
02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:44.000
That would still be one of the lowest salaries in the country.

1339
02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:48.500
It's not enough to make a career out of.

1340
02:34:48.500 --> 02:34:52.500
It's about, again, paying people for their work.

1341
02:34:52.500 --> 02:34:55.500
And I think this is work.

1342
02:34:55.500 --> 02:34:57.500
It's important work.

1343
02:34:57.500 --> 02:35:01.000
And it should be compensated as such.

1344
02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.500
So with that, I'll stop.

1345
02:35:03.500 --> 02:35:07.500
I think residents might be open to this.

1346
02:35:07.500 --> 02:35:15.500
And I think we should give them a chance to hear it and vote on it.

1347
02:35:15.500 --> 02:35:19.500
So thank you to the committee and Mr.

1348
02:35:19.500 --> 02:35:21.500
Chairman.

1349
02:35:21.500 --> 02:35:24.000
Thank you for your testimony.

1350
02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.500
Do I see any questions?

1351
02:35:26.500 --> 02:35:28.500
I have one.

1352
02:35:28.500 --> 02:35:30.500
Representative Green.

1353
02:35:30.500 --> 02:35:32.500
Thank you, Mr.

1354
02:35:32.500 --> 02:35:34.500
Chair.

1355
02:35:34.500 --> 02:35:53.000
Given what our current committee workload is with all our standing committees, how would reducing the body down to 200 representatives, for example, how do you think that would affect the distribution of the workload in committees?

1356
02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:56.500
What would be the effect of that?

1357
02:35:56.500 --> 02:35:59.000
Thank you for the question.

1358
02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:14.000
So I think, first of all, if we've got 780-odd bills this term, I think you could expect it would drop by maybe 40% since not every member does bills.

1359
02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:21.500
So you'd see fewer bills, and you'd see a comparable reallocation of members to committees.

1360
02:36:21.500 --> 02:36:34.500
So instead of 21 on a committee, which is a fairly large number relative to other legislative bodies in the country, you might see 15, 13.

1361
02:36:34.500 --> 02:36:45.500
You know, you would have to look at the numbers, but I think it could be done without any sort of interruption.

1362
02:36:45.500 --> 02:36:47.500
Done?

1363
02:36:47.500 --> 02:36:49.500
Anything else?

1364
02:36:49.500 --> 02:36:51.500
No?

1365
02:36:51.500 --> 02:36:54.000
Thank you for your testimony.

1366
02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
Thank you all.

1367
02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:59.500
Next up, we have Representative Klein Knight.

1368
02:36:59.500 --> 02:37:01.500
Welcome to legislative administration.

1369
02:37:01.500 --> 02:37:04.000
Thank you so much, Mr.

1370
02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
Chairman, and thank you.

1371
02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:11.000
I'm a representative Klein Knight represent Manchester Hillsborough district 11.

1372
02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:21.000
I don't want to repeat everything that representative Conley said, but I'm just going to point out some key facts.

1373
02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.500
This would promote more competition.

1374
02:37:23.500 --> 02:37:29.000
So we maybe have a higher standard and caliber of talent.

1375
02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:32.000
We'd have less bills and redundancy.

1376
02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:43.000
I know that we see a lot of the same bills just with different titles, and that can slow down our workload.

1377
02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
We'll have less obstruction.

1378
02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:54.000
We'll have to be more accountable to the relationships we build because we would be a smaller body.

1379
02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
There'd be more bipartisanship.

1380
02:37:56.000 --> 02:38:07.500
And it would open the door for more than just the independently wealthy and the retired to also serve and represent their people.

1381
02:38:07.500 --> 02:38:09.500
That's it.

1382
02:38:09.500 --> 02:38:11.500
Thank you.

1383
02:38:11.500 --> 02:38:15.500
Will you take questions if there are any?

1384
02:38:15.500 --> 02:38:17.500
Sure.

1385
02:38:17.500 --> 02:38:19.500
Are there any?

1386
02:38:19.500 --> 02:38:21.500
Representative Dispedia.

1387
02:38:21.500 --> 02:38:23.500
Thank you, Mr.

1388
02:38:23.500 --> 02:38:28.000
Chairman, and thank you, Nicole, and thank you, Casey.

1389
02:38:28.000 --> 02:39:49.000
Sorry, Representative Connolly, Representative Klein, I should have actually given this question towards Representative Connolly, but do you think, just thinking out loud, do you think that elections would get a little bit more expensive because there's less seats, or do you think there would still be, I mean, like representative connolly said there there is like you know sometimes we struggle to find people to even run so like what do you think about you know if we cut the legislature in half how do you think that affect elections it depends um what district you're in obviously there's a lot of small districts in our state where people run unopposed or they can't even find somebody so in that instance you wouldn't be spending obviously any money there um in some of the more populated areas like the cities like manchester you'll see more uh contested races more challenging races which will uh you, encourage people to raise more funds.

1390
02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:59.500
But when you cut the number of representatives obviously running, there's going to be obviously less money spent on local elections.

1391
02:39:59.500 --> 02:40:01.500
Thank you.

1392
02:40:01.500 --> 02:40:03.500
One further.

1393
02:40:03.500 --> 02:40:08.000
Are you not concerned about the reduction in representation?

1394
02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Not at all.

1395
02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:16.000
I believe we have the third largest democracy in the entire world.

1396
02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:19.500
We don't need that for a state.

1397
02:40:19.500 --> 02:40:22.500
It's comparable to countries like India.

1398
02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:33.500
And when you have too much of something, as the saying goes, too many cooks in the kitchen, the soup gets spoiled.

1399
02:40:33.500 --> 02:40:35.500
Thank you.

1400
02:40:35.500 --> 02:40:37.500
One pink card.

1401
02:40:37.500 --> 02:40:42.000
Honorable Dan Itza, who is opposed to the bill.

1402
02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Vehemently.

1403
02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
Thank you, Mr.

1404
02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.500
Chairman, members of the committee.

1405
02:40:48.500 --> 02:40:50.500
I'm still Dan Itza.

1406
02:40:50.500 --> 02:40:53.000
I still reside in Manchester.

1407
02:40:53.000 --> 02:41:01.500
I think reducing the number of legislators in the House of Representatives is a really bad idea.

1408
02:41:01.500 --> 02:41:18.500
It decreases the amount of representation, it decreases the ability of individuals to know their legislators, it will increase the cost of a lot of the elections, which will increase the influence of lobbyists.

1409
02:41:18.500 --> 02:41:25.500
It, you know, a statement was made, too many cooks are spoiling the broth.

1410
02:41:25.500 --> 02:41:59.500
Well, in a state that was just judged by the Cato Institute with the highest degree of personal liberty and economic, highest degree of economic liberty, that doesn't sound like a spoiled broth to me and I can't imagine why anybody would want to mess with that I served here for 18 years and during that time there was not an issue with people not knowing each other.

1411
02:41:59.500 --> 02:42:03.000
There was not an issue with rancor.

1412
02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:09.500
That I suggest is not an issue of the size of the body.

1413
02:42:09.500 --> 02:42:14.500
It has to do with how people are getting along.

1414
02:42:14.500 --> 02:42:42.000
I served until 2018 And I've talked with people about how much less collegiality there is since I've left I think that's probably more in effect of COVID than it is an effect of the legis the size of the legislature you're not meeting the way you used to you're not not meeting as frequently.

1415
02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:52.500
A lot of your committee, I mean, committee meeting attendance was never an issue for the entire time I was here.

1416
02:42:52.500 --> 02:43:04.500
If the idea of half the committee or a third of the committee not being here, you wouldn't have seen that four years ago.

1417
02:43:04.500 --> 02:43:08.500
You had no trouble filling the committee rooms.

1418
02:43:08.500 --> 02:43:17.000
It was not a problem, and it's not the size of the legislature that's causing that problem.

1419
02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:24.500
As to increasing the number of senators, I don't know if that's a bad idea.

1420
02:43:24.500 --> 02:43:28.000
They've always complained that they were overworked.

1421
02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:34.500
Since that number was set, the size of the state has increased dramatically.

1422
02:43:34.500 --> 02:43:41.500
Increasing the level of representation in the Senate might not be a bad idea.

1423
02:43:41.500 --> 02:44:18.500
I suspect that I would work with that number to make sure that it it a portioned among the people well and how you how it would play out as to Getting making sure all of the counties got more representation and not just a few of them If you decrease the number of the house from 400 to 200, that means a lot of towns that now enjoy their own representative won't anymore.

1424
02:44:18.500 --> 02:44:23.500
And that's one of the great things about New Hampshire.

1425
02:44:23.500 --> 02:44:31.000
As to only rich people can be in this body, well, I've never been rich.

1426
02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:40.000
A lot of the years I was here, I only made $17,000 or thereabouts, certainly less than 25.

1427
02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:48.000
I remember Greg Saltz who he delivered Coke, Coca-Cola, sorry, didn't want to mislead anybody there.

1428
02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:56.000
He did night deliveries so that he could attend to the general court during the day.

1429
02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:02.000
He was certainly not a rich man and he made it work.

1430
02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:12.500
I know people who've gotten their employers to allow them the time off and they shift their work to the weekends.

1431
02:45:12.500 --> 02:45:25.500
One of the great things about being in New Hampshire is basically anybody who has a situation they can work, it's an affordable and achievable goal.

1432
02:45:25.500 --> 02:45:36.000
During most of my career I made sure I never had to spend enough to report to the Secretary of State.

1433
02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
And that would end.

1434
02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:41.500
I'd be happy to take any questions.

1435
02:45:41.500 --> 02:45:44.000
Thank you for your testimony.

1436
02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
Questions?

1437
02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.500
Seeing none, I have one.

1438
02:45:48.500 --> 02:45:59.000
So my question is under the analysis of this CACR, it said all changes will take effect after the 2024 election.

1439
02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:06.500
What what would that do to redistricting that we've just spent an enormous Thank you.

1440
02:46:06.500 --> 02:46:08.500
the 2024 election.

1441
02:46:08.500 --> 02:46:16.000
What would that do to redistricting that we've just spent an enormous amount of time?

1442
02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:21.000
You would probably have to re-redistrict and I suspect that...

1443
02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:24.500
And is that not a constitutional requirement?

1444
02:46:24.500 --> 02:46:35.000
Yeah you'd you'd have to make provision in that amendment to have a single redistricting after the adoption of the amendment.

1445
02:46:35.000 --> 02:47:11.000
Much if you look at the language of the original districting in 1784, they had to do that and and there had to be some comment made when we changed the way districts were made in 2006 I believe we adopted the amendment and we had to make provision for when that would be affected this This would probably be cleaner if you just made it take effect in 2030 or 2032.

1446
02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
All right.

1447
02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
Thank you.

1448
02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
Any further?

1449
02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.500
Are we good to go?

1450
02:47:19.500 --> 02:47:22.500
Thank you very much, Honorable Itza.

1451
02:47:22.500 --> 02:47:27.500
I think, oh, I see it one more pink card.

1452
02:47:27.500 --> 02:47:29.500
Chair recognizes Alvin C.

1453
02:47:29.500 --> 02:47:33.500
who would like to speak on this bill.

1454
02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:35.500
Welcome to legislative administration.

1455
02:47:35.500 --> 02:47:37.500
Thank you Mr.

1456
02:47:37.500 --> 02:47:40.500
Chairman and members of the committee.

1457
02:47:40.500 --> 02:47:43.000
My name is Alvin C.

1458
02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:47.500
I live in Loudoun and I oppose this bill.

1459
02:47:47.500 --> 02:49:06.000
And the one thought I had that really stuck to my mind is Massachusetts now has 160 representatives they used to have a higher number and they had a constitutional amendment at some point and changed it at this point now the speaker of the house only needs to be able to control 80 votes or 80 representatives and that apparently is fairly easy to do with promises of being on a certain committee or committee chairmanships and next in line to be chair and other things like that that he can promise plus the fact that they with a larger population Massachusetts already has much larger house districts so it's harder for people to get around and just run it happen to run into their representatives so in this regard I think this would be a poor idea as far as the Senate going to more than 24, a bigger number is probably not a problem.

1460
02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:15.000
But to a certain extent, having two bodies that are elected based on population is kind of redundant.

1461
02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:19.000
The Senate used to be based on counties.

1462
02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:32.000
And it was because of some of the federal requirements of, of having one man, one vote for all state offices that ended up got ended.

1463
02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:36.000
So I'd be happy to take any questions.

1464
02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.500
Thank you for your testimony.

1465
02:49:38.500 --> 02:49:41.000
Do we have any questions?

1466
02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:44.000
I think you're good to go.

1467
02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
Thank you very much.

1468
02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
Thank you.

1469
02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
No other pink cards.

1470
02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:59.500
I think I can close the hearing on CACR 29 and we've got two minutes before we start 31.

1471
02:49:59.500 --> 02:50:01.500
Thank you.

1472
02:50:01.500 --> 02:50:03.500
Thank you.

1473
02:50:03.500 --> 02:50:05.500
Thank you.

1474
02:50:05.500 --> 02:50:10.000
Thank you, Chair, and hello again, Legislative Administration Committee.

1475
02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:19.000
As you all know, my name is Representative LeBranch, and I represent the town of Amherst, New Hampshire.

1476
02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:31.000
I'm here today to introduce CACR 31, which seeks to lower the age requirement to run for state senate from age 30 to 25.

1477
02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:36.000
There are many reasons why I'm bringing forward this bill.

1478
02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:50.500
First of all, let's start off with the fact that under the United States Constitution, 25 year olds may run and serve in the United States House of Representatives.

1479
02:50:50.500 --> 02:51:04.000
This means that the founding fathers of the United States entrusted 25 year olds with voting on our national budget and to vote on declarations of war.

1480
02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:17.000
This means that we trust 25-year-olds to vote on declaring war and voting on our multi-trillion dollar budget, but not being a New Hampshire state senator.

1481
02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:20.500
Secondly, New Hampshire is actually an outlier.

1482
02:51:20.500 --> 02:51:29.000
44 states in the United States have lower age requirements than we do, meaning lower than 30.

1483
02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:33.500
We are unique in having such a high requirement.

1484
02:51:33.500 --> 02:51:40.000
Lastly, we should allow voters to choose the representatives and to judge maturity.

1485
02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:48.000
Many other countries do not have age requirements to run for office because of this reason.

1486
02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:58.000
It does not make much sense to me that we should have an artificial barrier for voters choosing their representatives.

1487
02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:06.000
With that, I ask that the committee pass this bill, ought to pass, and thank you.

1488
02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.500
I will take any questions.

1489
02:52:08.500 --> 02:52:11.000
Thank you for your testimony.

1490
02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:14.500
Are there any questions from the committee?

1491
02:52:14.500 --> 02:52:16.500
I have one.

1492
02:52:16.500 --> 02:52:18.500
Representative Rula.

1493
02:52:18.500 --> 02:52:20.500
Hi.

1494
02:52:20.500 --> 02:52:46.000
thanks for taking the question how many state representatives in the house are there now that are age under 30 or actually I should say age 25 current I don't have that number on hand but I could definitely find that out and send that for in an email to you.

1495
02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000
Thanks.

1496
02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.500
So I have a question.

1497
02:52:50.500 --> 02:53:08.000
It you said recently in your testimony that you are against the artificial barrier or arbitrary barrier I think and yet in a priorACR, we were talking about 15 years, 15 terms being a barrier.

1498
02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:11.500
So how do we rectify the two?

1499
02:53:11.500 --> 02:53:15.000
One artificial barrier is good, one isn't.

1500
02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:21.500
So I would like to just say that it is a good comparison.

1501
02:53:21.500 --> 02:53:32.500
and is an artificial barrier, and it was my understanding that we are against artificial barriers, and this is one of those.

1502
02:53:32.500 --> 02:53:45.500
That previous bill was more of a request from a constituent, and I do believe 30 years is a long time to be in this house.

1503
02:53:45.500 --> 02:54:00.000
So that was one of the reasons, but the age requirement seems a little bit more arbitrary in this case, just because age is not a dictation of maturity.

1504
02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:05.500
I, myself, just turning 20, am sitting here today to testify.

1505
02:54:05.500 --> 02:54:10.000
So I guess if I'm answering that question correctly.

1506
02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
Sure.

1507
02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.500
Thank you for your testimony.

1508
02:54:14.500 --> 02:54:25.000
The other question I had is why we're okay with the age limit for House of Representatives but not the Senate.

1509
02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:29.000
That's primarily your concern at this point, right?

1510
02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:39.000
So the nuance here is that it's the United States House of Representatives that has an age limit of 25.

1511
02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:44.000
Obviously, the United States House of Representatives deals with impeachment.

1512
02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:47.000
It deals with the national budget.

1513
02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:59.500
It deals with matters of war, while the state senate deals with judicial appointments and other appointments and such business as the senate does consider.

1514
02:54:59.500 --> 02:55:20.000
I believe what I'm trying to point out is that we trust 25-year-olds with matters of life and death and trillion dollar budgets, but do not trust them with the state to New Hampshire and the matters that we deal with.

1515
02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
Great.

1516
02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
Okay.

1517
02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:27.500
Thank you very much for your testimony.

1518
02:55:27.500 --> 02:55:29.500
There is no others.

1519
02:55:29.500 --> 02:55:31.500
Thank you again.

1520
02:55:31.500 --> 02:55:34.000
I see another pink card.

1521
02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:37.000
Yeah, well, um, representative Klein Knight.

1522
02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:40.000
I also see a senator Whitley.

1523
02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
No.

1524
02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000
Thank you.

1525
02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000
Senator Klein Knight, you're.

1526
02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:50.500
I am just a humble state rep, but sorry.

1527
02:55:50.500 --> 02:55:52.500
Humble.

1528
02:55:52.500 --> 02:55:56.500
Thank you, members of this committee and chairman.

1529
02:55:56.500 --> 02:55:59.500
I am my own state rep.

1530
02:55:59.500 --> 02:56:15.000
I differ from a lot of opinions from the last representative that spoke, especially in regards to term limits, because of some of the reasons I mentioned, given my last testimony.

1531
02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:26.000
And I do believe that it corresponds directly with this bill in terms of mentorship and passing along knowledge that is institutional.

1532
02:56:26.000 --> 02:57:00.500
and if we put an age on that then we may lose some really valuable teachers that can pass the torch to the younger representatives or senators and for that matter I just want to point out that Only five states have the 30 age requirement and nine states out of 50 have 18 as their age requirement and the median for the entire country is 21 to 25.

1533
02:57:00.500 --> 02:57:10.500
So we would be on par with the rest of the country if you take a look at the figures.

1534
02:57:10.500 --> 02:57:17.500
So with that, I think that I agree with everything Representative LeBranche spoke on.

1535
02:57:17.500 --> 02:57:33.000
I do believe that keeping the age at a 30 minimum is a little ageist, and I think we should see a change to align with the rest of the country.

1536
02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
Thank you.

1537
02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
Thank you.

1538
02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:41.000
Would you accept questions if there are any?

1539
02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
Sure.

1540
02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:46.000
There is one from Representative Simon.

1541
02:57:46.000 --> 02:58:03.500
Sorry, I probably should have asked Representative LeBranche this question as well, but I recognize that as a general rule, we're an outlier on this and that the age requirements for other places is lower.

1542
02:58:03.500 --> 02:58:12.000
Do we know that that's going well in those other places where people have held those positions?

1543
02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:22.500
Do you have any data that you could share with us as far as how that's worked out in other places?

1544
02:58:22.500 --> 02:58:28.000
Well, I can't speak to the nitty-gritty details of every state.

1545
02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:48.000
I can say that because the median age is 21 to 25 for more than all, you know, there's only nine that are lower than that, nine states, and only five states that are at 30 age requirement right now.

1546
02:58:48.000 --> 02:59:03.500
So that should point out to us that it is going well, and it has moved other states to change it, and so that's why there's an increase in that number.

1547
02:59:03.500 --> 02:59:09.000
Okay, let me try and take another bite of the apple.

1548
02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:42.500
I mean, just to follow up on that, I mean, logically, I understand what you're saying from a logical perspective, but as far as if we were to change the law here based off of just the current testimony that we've heard, we would be doing it in faith that it's going well in those other areas, and that could have happened in other states as well.

1549
02:59:42.500 --> 03:00:04.000
So my main question would just be do you have any data from any others or could you get us data from any other states that shows that people have held those offices that that has in fact been, that has gone well?

1550
03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:08.000
Of course we can get you that data.

1551
03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:12.500
We can do that within the next 24 hours.

1552
03:00:12.500 --> 03:00:16.000
Thank you so much for that question.

1553
03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:19.500
We'll get back to you on that.

1554
03:00:19.500 --> 03:00:31.500
But I highly doubt that the majority of the states, whether you're blue or red, would make this change if things were going poorly.

1555
03:00:31.500 --> 03:00:33.500
Thank you.

1556
03:00:33.500 --> 03:00:53.500
So I guess when you're doing the research on that, what I would like to see is those states that did reduce it down to 25, how many people are actually serving at that age after they've gone to 25?

1557
03:00:53.500 --> 03:00:57.000
That's what I would be interested in.

1558
03:00:57.000 --> 03:01:02.000
I don't know what going well or going poorly means.

1559
03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:10.500
What I'm interested in is, does the change actually create the results that you're suggesting will happen?

1560
03:01:10.500 --> 03:01:27.500
Just for a point of clarification, would you be open to data that shows that they're not just staying in those positions, but they're actually going to other institutions of service within the country?

1561
03:01:27.500 --> 03:01:32.500
Because I consider that still a win for public service.

1562
03:01:32.500 --> 03:01:34.500
No.

1563
03:01:34.500 --> 03:01:38.500
You want them to stay in the House?

1564
03:01:38.500 --> 03:01:40.500
Sure.

1565
03:01:40.500 --> 03:01:48.500
This is a bill to deal with the age change within the Senate in the state.

1566
03:01:48.500 --> 03:02:04.000
So what I'm interested in is other places where this age change has taken place because it's been suggested to us that this would allow others to serve in state Senate.

1567
03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:18.000
I would like to know if when that change took place whether it in fact did increase the number of people that served from age 25 to 30.

1568
03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:20.000
Something like that.

1569
03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:27.000
Okay so the number of people increased not retention wise in the office itself.

1570
03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000
Okay.

1571
03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000
Right.

1572
03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000
Representative Espedia.

1573
03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000
Thank, Mr.

1574
03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:38.500
Chair, and thank you, Nicole, once again.

1575
03:02:38.500 --> 03:02:46.500
Have you ever heard of a state working to increase the age limit of any position?

1576
03:02:46.500 --> 03:02:48.500
No, I have not.

1577
03:02:48.500 --> 03:02:50.500
Thanks.

1578
03:02:50.500 --> 03:02:52.500
Follow-up.

1579
03:02:52.500 --> 03:02:54.500
I want to apologize.

1580
03:02:54.500 --> 03:02:58.000
Sometimes my playful nature is a little...

1581
03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:06.000
When you were talking, I just didn't want to come across as being disrespectful at all.

1582
03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:27.000
Just to clarify my question, one of my concerns would be, and I guess what I was looking for as far as it's going well, do people who hold positions of power at that age end up running into personal conduct issues?

1583
03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:41.500
For example, I know that a state representative from my town who is 18 ended up running into trouble where they bought alcohol for underage people while holding office.

1584
03:03:41.500 --> 03:03:56.000
That sort of decision-making that we tend to get a little bit better at as we get older, things along those lines are somewhat what I was concerned about.

1585
03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:58.000
Thank you for that.

1586
03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:13.500
I believe, actually, that presumption is inappropriate because I know a lot of members older than that that have sexually harassed other members and have also violated the code of conduct.

1587
03:04:13.500 --> 03:04:18.500
So I believe that age doesn't discriminate with bad behavior.

1588
03:04:18.500 --> 03:04:21.000
Thank you for your testimony.

1589
03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:24.000
We have no other pink cards.

1590
03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:32.500
30 31 Yep, yep, yep, I had it in the actually is Senator Whitley here or representative?

1591
03:04:32.500 --> 03:04:34.500
Okay.

1592
03:04:34.500 --> 03:04:37.500
Won't be able to make it.

1593
03:04:37.500 --> 03:04:39.500
Okay.

1594
03:04:39.500 --> 03:04:41.500
Thank you.

1595
03:04:41.500 --> 03:04:44.500
She sent you a text or...

1596
03:04:44.500 --> 03:04:46.500
Okay.

1597
03:04:46.500 --> 03:04:50.000
So we should just eliminate her card.

1598
03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.000
Got it.

1599
03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:54.000
You're up.

1600
03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:56.500
What was your name again?

1601
03:04:56.500 --> 03:04:59.000
It's been a good day.

1602
03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:04.000
Just going to invoke the law of unintended consequences here.

1603
03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:43.000
You're not just increasing, it would not be just decreasing the age of qualification for senators whether or not you advise to put it before the people the qualifications for counselors that's executive counselors shall be the same as for senator so you would also be reducing the age qualification for executive counselors by If the people adopted this Thank you My my question is did is exactly has anyone seen in this anything mentioned on executive counselors?

1604
03:05:43.000 --> 03:06:00.500
reference again where where was that oh that is in part two can make me find it again I was scrambling there we go part two article 61 article 60 the funny things you remember.

1605
03:06:00.500 --> 03:06:03.000
Yeah, so the ages are...

1606
03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:25.000
The governor has a separate stipulation on age which is 30, but the executive councillor's age limit is tied to the senators which I presume stems from the period when, oh couldn't couldn't have Couldn't have I don't know when that was put in.

1607
03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:44.500
Yeah So it wasn't from the time when you know because council was made up of reps and no because reps always had a lower age limit I think originally it was 25 so it couldn't have been there.

1608
03:06:44.500 --> 03:06:49.500
So it must have been specifically done after that fact.

1609
03:06:49.500 --> 03:06:51.500
Yep huh.

1610
03:06:51.500 --> 03:06:53.500
Interesting.

1611
03:06:53.500 --> 03:06:55.500
Any further?

1612
03:06:55.500 --> 03:06:57.500
No you're good.

1613
03:06:57.500 --> 03:06:59.500
I'm good.

1614
03:06:59.500 --> 03:07:03.000
Thank you very much for your information.

1615
03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:12.500
With that we're back in our holding pattern until 3 30 for the last CACR of the day, right?

1616
03:07:12.500 --> 03:07:14.500
All right.

1617
03:07:14.500 --> 03:07:16.500
Thank you.

1618
03:07:16.500 --> 03:07:18.500
I guess I see.

1619
03:07:18.500 --> 03:07:20.500
I guess I see.

1620
03:07:20.500 --> 03:07:22.500
Residency.

1621
03:07:22.500 --> 03:07:24.500
I don't know.

1622
03:07:24.500 --> 03:07:26.500
Yeah.

1623
03:07:26.500 --> 03:07:28.500
Yeah.

1624
03:07:28.500 --> 03:07:30.500
Yeah.

1625
03:07:30.500 --> 03:07:32.500
Yeah.

1626
03:07:32.500 --> 03:07:34.500
Yeah.

1627
03:07:34.500 --> 03:07:36.500
Well, no.

1628
03:07:36.500 --> 03:07:38.500
I can finally not.

1629
03:07:38.500 --> 03:07:40.500
Yeah.

1630
03:07:40.500 --> 03:07:42.500
Yeah.

1631
03:07:42.500 --> 03:07:44.500
Yeah.

1632
03:07:44.500 --> 03:07:46.500
Yeah.

1633
03:07:46.500 --> 03:07:48.500
Yeah.

1634
03:07:48.500 --> 03:07:50.500
Yeah.

1635
03:07:50.500 --> 03:07:52.500
Yeah.

1636
03:07:52.500 --> 03:07:54.500
Yeah.

1637
03:07:54.500 --> 03:07:56.500
Yeah.

1638
03:07:56.500 --> 03:07:58.500
Yeah.

1639
03:07:58.500 --> 03:08:00.500
Yeah.

1640
03:08:00.500 --> 03:08:02.500
that we carry.

1641
03:08:02.500 --> 03:08:04.500
So it's this point.

1642
03:08:04.500 --> 03:08:06.500
Yeah.

1643
03:08:06.500 --> 03:08:09.500
Obviously that wasn't the only issue.

1644
03:08:09.500 --> 03:08:11.500
Thank you.

1645
03:08:11.500 --> 03:08:14.000
You have to read it.

1646
03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:16.500
You have to read it.

1647
03:08:16.500 --> 03:08:19.000
You have to read it.

1648
03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:21.500
I get thought of it.

1649
03:08:21.500 --> 03:08:23.500
Yeah.

1650
03:08:23.500 --> 03:08:25.500
Yeah.

1651
03:08:25.500 --> 03:08:28.000
It should be quite frank.

1652
03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:30.000
I have no idea.

1653
03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:32.500
and learn what he said.

1654
03:08:32.500 --> 03:08:34.500
What is it?

1655
03:08:34.500 --> 03:08:39.500
And the rest of the department didn't get the plurality.

1656
03:08:39.500 --> 03:08:42.000
It should have been majority.

1657
03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:48.000
The rest of the conditions are in there who makes the decision.

1658
03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:50.000
Right.

1659
03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:55.500
Or you do have to do a runoff election or whatever.

1660
03:08:55.500 --> 03:08:58.000
Just go back to majority.

1661
03:08:58.000 --> 03:09:00.000
It's a problem solved.

1662
03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:02.000
One word, change it.

1663
03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:10.000
Yeah, I mean, it was a really bad, I think it was a really bad decision.

1664
03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:14.000
It was in the air of constitutional convention.

1665
03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:17.500
Don't think it was a bad idea.

1666
03:09:17.500 --> 03:09:22.500
But it was something that was happening at the time.

1667
03:09:22.500 --> 03:09:29.000
You will find that a lot of states at that, but the majority...

1668
03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:31.000
So this is 1911.

1669
03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:33.000
Yes.

1670
03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:35.000
The 20th century.

1671
03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:37.000
One of the concerns.

1672
03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:39.000
Okay.

1673
03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:41.000
Thank you.

1674
03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:43.000
Thank you.

1675
03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:45.000
Thank you.

1676
03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:47.000
Thank you.

1677
03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:49.000
Thank you.

1678
03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:51.000
Thank you.

1679
03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:53.000
Thank you.

1680
03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:55.000
Thank you.

1681
03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:57.000
Thank you.

1682
03:09:57.000 --> 03:09:59.000
Thank you.

1683
03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:02.000
So the time being 3 30.

1684
03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:08.500
I'm opening the hearing on CACR 33 requesting the prime sponsor, Representative Moffitt.

1685
03:10:08.500 --> 03:10:10.500
Please testify.

1686
03:10:10.500 --> 03:10:13.500
Welcome to Legislative Administration, Representative Moffitt.

1687
03:10:13.500 --> 03:10:15.500
Thank you, Mr.

1688
03:10:15.500 --> 03:10:17.500
Chair.

1689
03:10:17.500 --> 03:10:21.500
And I did submit electronically some testimony earlier.

1690
03:10:21.500 --> 03:10:27.500
And I have some written testimony here, which I might refer to.

1691
03:10:27.500 --> 03:10:31.500
I'm perhaps a little nervous being up here.

1692
03:10:31.500 --> 03:10:33.500
I can understand.

1693
03:10:33.500 --> 03:10:46.000
So thank you for putting this in at the end of the day, and so we won't be rushed, and there's a lot of questions.

1694
03:10:46.000 --> 03:11:03.500
So anyway, this proposed measure, CACR 33, as you know, seeks to enable New Hampshire legislature to create a procedure permitting citizens to remove an elected official before the end of a term of office.

1695
03:11:03.500 --> 03:11:09.500
Now, this is the same proposal that some of you may recall.

1696
03:11:09.500 --> 03:11:15.000
It was submitted last term by four of our Democratic colleagues.

1697
03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:17.500
This is the same proposal.

1698
03:11:17.500 --> 03:11:37.000
So, I was told that the major reasons, or the major reason that the CACR did not move forward previously was that the state of New Hampshire, the state of New Hampshire's elected representatives are all two year terms.

1699
03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:47.500
Now Now, believe it or not, I know that and I knew that that New Hampshire's elected officials are two-year officials.

1700
03:11:47.500 --> 03:11:55.000
I sponsored the two House bills on civics that passed, so I'm aware of that.

1701
03:11:55.000 --> 03:12:10.500
So regarding recalls, the thinking which I understand was that if we turn people over every two years, we really don't need to have a process in place to recall them.

1702
03:12:10.500 --> 03:12:12.500
And I understand that.

1703
03:12:12.500 --> 03:12:14.500
That's all true.

1704
03:12:14.500 --> 03:12:24.500
But there are many locally elected board positions that are not two-year positions, as I'm sure you know, three-year positions.

1705
03:12:24.500 --> 03:12:27.000
That's quite a lot different.

1706
03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:34.000
And those positions are the ones that really prompted interest in reviving the CACR.

1707
03:12:34.000 --> 03:13:01.500
For example, if two individuals were elected to three-year terms on some local board, five-member board, and both individuals proved to be, you name it, radical extremists, corrupt, or otherwise unfit to serve, that district or that municipality would have no recourse but to endure these individuals for one, two, three years, they'd be trapped.

1708
03:13:01.500 --> 03:13:07.500
And such situations have occurred, and they probably likely will occur again.

1709
03:13:07.500 --> 03:13:46.500
And if or when they do, these municipalities, these towns, these districts would have no recourse but to just endure heaven knows what and I think many of us some of us think that this legislature owes it to communities to provide a mechanism that would allow districts relief when these situations occur that's why you know I think there's a need for some consideration for action here via CAECR 33, which I know is a heavy lift.

1710
03:13:46.500 --> 03:13:49.500
Again, I sponsored the civics bill.

1711
03:13:49.500 --> 03:13:54.500
So anyway, I went to serve on the school board.

1712
03:13:54.500 --> 03:14:00.000
And interesting, I was asked to serve on the school board.

1713
03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:11.500
I was a former teacher, so the teachers came to me and asked if I wanted to run, and I said, well, maybe.

1714
03:14:11.500 --> 03:15:04.000
And then some fiscal conservatives came to me asked if I wanted to run because I was a former teacher so the teachers came to me and asked if I wanted to run and I said well Maybe and then some fiscal conservatives came to me and asked if I wanted to run because I was both a teacher and a fiscal conservative believe it or not So I decided to run and oddly I think that these two camps didn't know that I'd been recruited by the other camp and I won I became a school board member and as a school board member.

1715
03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:10.000
I saw things that I'm sure many of you are familiar with.

1716
03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:12.000
I saw both extremes.

1717
03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:30.500
I saw people including some board members in our greater district who just wanted to cut everything and the opposite extreme were people who wanted to spend far more than the district or districts could ever afford.

1718
03:15:30.500 --> 03:15:47.500
And that's okay, but beyond those extremes in terms of philosophy, sometimes you have extremists, and there are some out there now who are on boards, who simply want to disrupt and cause trouble.

1719
03:15:47.500 --> 03:15:53.500
They don't have a philosophical interest in serving their community per se.

1720
03:15:53.500 --> 03:15:58.000
They have an interest in just messing things up.

1721
03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:03.000
They have been out there and they're out there now.

1722
03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:08.000
So, the CACR does not propose any specific recall mechanism.

1723
03:16:08.000 --> 03:16:15.000
It would simply empower the legislature, us, to consider future proposals in this area.

1724
03:16:15.000 --> 03:16:18.000
It's enabling legislation for our legislature.

1725
03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:22.500
So why would we not want to enable ourselves?

1726
03:16:22.500 --> 03:16:35.000
A possible answer might lie in a remark made to me by somebody who looked at the proposal and said What makes talking to me?

1727
03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:44.000
What makes you think a bunch of politicians would ever consider a proposal where they could get recalled?

1728
03:16:44.000 --> 03:17:01.000
Which annoyed me and I said I don't consider us to be politicians really in the normal pejorative sense of the word, you know, I consider us to be something higher than that, truly.

1729
03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:04.500
Citizen legislators in the New Hampshire tradition.

1730
03:17:04.500 --> 03:17:11.000
So, we make a hundred bucks a year, as you all well know.

1731
03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:27.500
So, the notion of politicians or people like us putting in or considering a mechanism for recall elections, I think is kind of a noble thing, an altruistic thing I'd be proud of.

1732
03:17:27.500 --> 03:17:36.000
So anyway, I think it would be inspiring for us to consider this, hopefully move it forward.

1733
03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:46.500
And as I look around this room, I see a lot of really sharp people, including the chair, is especially sharp.

1734
03:17:46.500 --> 03:18:12.000
So I'm sure that you'll hopefully give this a fair discussion fair discussion it's okay I think we've heard enough so I'm wondering if there are any questions for the representative I see one from representative Roulard Thank You representative Moffitt you said a couple of things that I wrote down.

1735
03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:20.500
You said there are a couple of reasons that we would want to have local officials removed.

1736
03:18:20.500 --> 03:18:25.000
One of them was corruption, because they were corrupt.

1737
03:18:25.000 --> 03:18:50.500
my question is are there local rules or ordinances that deal with any type of corruption, breaking the law, any kind of criminal activity, if they are corrupt, that would have individuals removed from their seat or if they are criminally prosec, sent to jail with a vacancy to replace them?

1738
03:18:50.500 --> 03:18:52.500
Great question.

1739
03:18:52.500 --> 03:18:54.500
Thank you, Representative Ruiar.

1740
03:18:54.500 --> 03:19:07.000
Yes, you asked about local situations, which is a great question, because there are, as you well know, local boards are governed by state statutes.

1741
03:19:07.000 --> 03:20:10.500
So I do not believe, and you may be ahead of me on this, especially if you have some legal background, locally, if there is a corrupt or a local official, a board member of some sort who is engaged in nefarious activity or alleged nefarious activity you name it The first thing locally people would go to that person and say you need to quit you know, we you know, we want you out of here and Oftentimes that I'm sure does is how things resolve themselves locally in terms of a local mechanism that you referred to that exists for a locality to get rid of a dysfunctional board member, I don't know that that exists, and you may be ahead of me on that.

1742
03:20:10.500 --> 03:20:18.000
Well, I really wasn't talking about locality if they have a board member that disrupts.

1743
03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:30.500
I'm talking about a board member that is corrupt and has perhaps a criminal prosecution coming their way and gets convicted and put in jail.

1744
03:20:30.500 --> 03:20:44.000
Is there a local ordinance or something that would allow that town to replace that person that is no longer on the board because of a vacancy?

1745
03:20:44.000 --> 03:20:52.500
Well, you know, as you know, an ordinance is a local law that's, you know, passed locally.

1746
03:20:52.500 --> 03:21:01.500
So a municipality could, I'm sure, vote on a warrant article or an ordinance locally to cover that.

1747
03:21:01.500 --> 03:21:09.500
Now, whether it would stand up in the courts, you'd be ahead of me on that.

1748
03:21:09.500 --> 03:21:15.000
America has a tradition of people, elected officials, being in jail.

1749
03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:25.000
You could Google and find a lot of people in jail who refuse to step down from their elected positions.

1750
03:21:25.000 --> 03:21:28.500
And in many cases, people applaud that.

1751
03:21:28.500 --> 03:21:35.000
So back to your point about a local ordinance taking care of that.

1752
03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:48.000
I don't know, and I can't off the top of my head, cite a municipality or a district in the state that has that in place.

1753
03:21:48.000 --> 03:21:52.000
It's very interesting, but I can't name one.

1754
03:21:52.000 --> 03:21:54.000
Follow up.

1755
03:21:54.000 --> 03:21:56.000
Follow up.

1756
03:21:56.000 --> 03:22:00.500
Let me just make it maybe a little clearer.

1757
03:22:00.500 --> 03:22:13.500
There may be a time where a vacancy occurs, corruption, a death, whatever it is, and the town decides that they need to fill that position.

1758
03:22:13.500 --> 03:22:18.000
Do they have the ability to do that now?

1759
03:22:18.000 --> 03:22:25.500
The question is, do towns or municipalities currently have a chance to fill a vacancy?

1760
03:22:25.500 --> 03:22:29.500
Now, when you say vacancy, yes, they do.

1761
03:22:29.500 --> 03:22:33.000
But what if there is no vacancy?

1762
03:22:33.000 --> 03:22:37.000
What if there is someone who won't leave?

1763
03:22:37.000 --> 03:22:46.000
I mean, that's the point of this is they can't fill a vacancy unless there is a vacancy.

1764
03:22:46.000 --> 03:22:50.000
What if there is someone who won't leave?

1765
03:22:50.000 --> 03:23:06.000
I mean that's the point of this is they can't they can't fill a vacancy unless there is a vacancy and there's no vacancy if the if the bad apple doesn't vacate.

1766
03:23:06.000 --> 03:23:08.000
Follow up of that.

1767
03:23:08.000 --> 03:23:27.000
There is a vacancy, held due respect, if the person is in jail and they're not able to perform their duties based upon corruption, malfeasance, something that they've done, going back to your original statement, corruption, criminal process.

1768
03:23:27.000 --> 03:23:39.000
So you're saying that if there is a vacancy because they're unable to fulfill their duty, there is a process to fulfill that position.

1769
03:23:39.000 --> 03:23:42.500
There are processes to fill vacancies currently.

1770
03:23:42.500 --> 03:24:00.500
People can can be, for example, if there's a one-year school board, less than one year on a school board term, the school board can appoint someone to fill that vacancy if there is a vacancy.

1771
03:24:00.500 --> 03:24:09.000
But if someone's in jail, as you probably know, Representative, individuals are considered innocent until proven guilty.

1772
03:24:09.000 --> 03:24:45.000
So if somebody is in jail for whatever reason and for a short time you know there's a whole spectrum of reasons they could be in jail for how long they're in jail so just because they're in jail doesn't mean that there's automatically a vacancy and there shouldn't be what if someone's you know they deserve due process so just because someone's in jail doesn't mean there's ipso facto a vacancy.

1773
03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:47.000
I have another question.

1774
03:24:47.000 --> 03:24:49.000
One more.

1775
03:24:49.000 --> 03:24:51.000
One more.

1776
03:24:51.000 --> 03:24:53.000
Okay.

1777
03:24:53.000 --> 03:25:00.000
You said something about there can be individuals on school committees that have extremes.

1778
03:25:00.000 --> 03:25:05.000
One wants to cut money, one wants to spend money.

1779
03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:10.500
And my question is, isn't that the reason we elect them?

1780
03:25:10.500 --> 03:25:18.500
Yes, I hear your point, and I'm not sure I express that in the best way.

1781
03:25:18.500 --> 03:25:34.500
When I was on the board, I saw extremes in terms of philosophical, in terms of wanting to cut all spending or spend too much, those inherently are not, you know, wrong.

1782
03:25:34.500 --> 03:25:45.000
But there are extremes on both sides whereby someone beyond philosophy simply wants to, as I said earlier, mess things up.

1783
03:25:45.000 --> 03:25:55.000
They're not interested in ideologically or philosophically trying to do a certain policy for education one way or the other.

1784
03:25:55.000 --> 03:26:08.000
So what I'm talking about when I say extremes, beyond the extremes I saw, the extremes in terms of individuals who just want to wreak havoc.

1785
03:26:08.000 --> 03:26:17.000
And they know they'll never be reelected, but they're in there not for one year or two years.

1786
03:26:17.000 --> 03:26:20.000
They're in there for three years.

1787
03:26:20.000 --> 03:26:25.500
And this has happened, and I'm sure it will happen again.

1788
03:26:25.500 --> 03:27:02.000
And as I've already said, when these individuals end up on a board, then that right now, as I understand it, that's why this CACR was presumably submitted last term, and so why it's being submitted this term, is to give, enable this legislature to create a mechanism, whatever that may be, to give municipalities a hope of removing an individual who is just ruining their processes in their town or the municipality.

1789
03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:04.000
Thank you.

1790
03:27:04.000 --> 03:27:06.000
Further questions?

1791
03:27:06.000 --> 03:27:08.000
I have one.

1792
03:27:08.000 --> 03:27:24.500
So I'm reading on page two of the CACR that the wording of the question to be put before the qualified voters shall be and it goes from line seven to line 33.

1793
03:27:24.500 --> 03:27:34.000
Is that correct that someone answering the question as a qualified voter would be reading however many that is.

1794
03:27:34.000 --> 03:27:53.500
Sure and if if you look at it what you're looking at now the the only change I mean this is existing statute or not existing statute but it's, this is how Article 5 would be amended or changed.

1795
03:27:53.500 --> 03:28:14.500
And the relevant language here is on lines 12 and 13, and it simply says that, you know, we provide for and provide a recall procedure to permit citizens to remove an elected official before the end of the term of office.

1796
03:28:14.500 --> 03:28:18.500
So that, it's basically one line, 12, 13.

1797
03:28:18.500 --> 03:28:38.500
That's the very simple addition to current statute that would enable the legislature to consider, which you cannot do now without this, creating a mechanism to empower municipalities to get rid of an individual needs to be getting rid of.

1798
03:28:38.500 --> 03:28:40.500
Thank you.

1799
03:28:40.500 --> 03:29:20.000
My follow-up question is, these individuals that were elected, presumably, but are intent on wreaking havoc, or wreaking havoc, as you said, They were duly voted and maybe it is it possible though that the that the townspeople that voted for those people had the intention of wreaking havoc and and they're doing exactly what they were voted in to do and you're coming in and you're proposing that we come along with a way to change the vote.

1800
03:29:20.000 --> 03:29:23.000
Yeah, thank you for your question.

1801
03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:26.000
I think I understand the question.

1802
03:29:26.000 --> 03:29:42.500
And certainly, we've all been around, certainly there are cases where somebody with some, whatever their views are, people select, vote for people, hoping in some cases that they will stir things up.

1803
03:29:42.500 --> 03:29:47.000
And you're right, we're talking about overturning an election.

1804
03:29:47.000 --> 03:29:50.000
That's the definition of a recall.

1805
03:29:50.000 --> 03:29:55.000
So this would go to the people, to the citizens.

1806
03:29:55.000 --> 03:30:42.000
If a majority or a supermajority, whatever, if anything comes from this, whatever mechanism is ultimately put in place via majority or supermajority if if a if a majority of the citizens of the community desperately want their town to work or their board to work and it's not going to work if they have one or more people that are on the board for example if you take a five-, say two members are elected, and then say there's a third member who's already on the board who just goes off the reservation.

1807
03:30:42.000 --> 03:30:58.500
And suddenly, and this has happened, you get three out of five people on a board creating policy, whatever board that may be, that is just not in the interest of the town.

1808
03:30:58.500 --> 03:31:10.500
So that town now is stuck for a year or two, depending on terms, with a dysfunctional, horrible board that is ruining the town.

1809
03:31:10.500 --> 03:31:12.500
Very serious.

1810
03:31:12.500 --> 03:31:17.500
I mean, that has happened, and it will happen again.

1811
03:31:17.500 --> 03:31:35.000
And without a mechanism to allow a town to recall, if they so desire, but via majority, supermajority, whatever, an individual, then we, you, are condemning a town to chaos for a year or two.

1812
03:31:35.000 --> 03:31:38.000
It's really a very serious thing.

1813
03:31:38.000 --> 03:31:40.000
Does it happen often?

1814
03:31:40.000 --> 03:31:42.000
No.

1815
03:31:42.000 --> 03:31:44.000
Does it happen?

1816
03:31:44.000 --> 03:31:46.000
Yes.

1817
03:31:46.000 --> 03:31:54.000
Do we have a responsibility to give these municipalities an option for some sort of relief?

1818
03:31:54.000 --> 03:32:08.500
Obviously, I think so because I revived this CACR that is a mentioned before for for Democratic representatives submitted before thank you question representative is media thank you mr.

1819
03:32:08.500 --> 03:32:24.000
chair and thank you Moffitt so do you do you you by chance know the exact bill or wording that the Democrats, when we brought a similar bill, what it was?

1820
03:32:24.000 --> 03:32:26.000
It's this.

1821
03:32:26.000 --> 03:32:32.500
I just essentially lifted what was submitted before and resubmitted it this time.

1822
03:32:32.500 --> 03:32:44.000
So what you're looking at, I believe, because I pulled it from what was previously submitted, this is what came in last term.

1823
03:32:44.000 --> 03:32:46.000
Oh, last term, okay.

1824
03:32:46.000 --> 03:32:49.000
I was just curious about that.

1825
03:32:49.000 --> 03:32:54.500
Can you remind us what was the outcome of that vote?

1826
03:32:54.500 --> 03:32:56.500
Yes.

1827
03:32:56.500 --> 03:33:03.000
The outcome of this previous, when this came in before, was ITL'd, obviously.

1828
03:33:03.000 --> 03:33:11.000
And one of the sponsors came to me and said, everybody said, two years, two years.

1829
03:33:11.000 --> 03:33:18.000
Don't you know we have elections every two years and we don't need this?

1830
03:33:18.000 --> 03:33:47.000
And as I said at the beginning of my remarks, I know that New Hampshire positions are two-year positions and this really is not particularly aimed at elected to your positions it's what happened after left this room I was not here last term due to ill health voters Voters get sick of me apparently for one term.

1831
03:33:47.000 --> 03:33:54.000
But anyway, I was not here so- You were one of those wreaking havoc.

1832
03:33:54.000 --> 03:33:56.500
Was that what it was?

1833
03:33:56.500 --> 03:34:00.000
I hope I would never wreak havoc.

1834
03:34:00.000 --> 03:34:02.000
I'm sure you would.

1835
03:34:02.000 --> 03:34:12.500
Perhaps, I know that it was ITL, but I'm not sure if you- I don't know what the floor vote was.

1836
03:34:12.500 --> 03:34:15.000
That's what I was asking.

1837
03:34:15.000 --> 03:34:57.500
I believe it was, I'm not sure if you I don't know what the floor vote was that's what I was asking I believe it was I'm not sure I was not I was here two terms though not last term and I'm not sure if there's anyone here last term who might recollect the floor vote on it it was on consent I'm not sure the chair is here you you were the chair at that point you know know what happened to the...

1838
03:34:57.500 --> 03:34:59.500
Okay, doesn't matter.

1839
03:34:59.500 --> 03:35:01.500
We'll find out.

1840
03:35:01.500 --> 03:35:03.500
Further questions?

1841
03:35:03.500 --> 03:35:05.500
Anyone?

1842
03:35:05.500 --> 03:35:08.000
Thank you for your testimony.

1843
03:35:08.000 --> 03:35:10.000
Thank you all.

1844
03:35:10.000 --> 03:35:13.500
I think that closes out our day.

1845
03:35:13.500 --> 03:35:16.000
Thank you for showing up.

1846
03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:19.000
Thank you for your diligence today.

1847
03:35:19.000 --> 03:35:23.000
That's already on the list for us today.

1848
03:35:23.000 --> 03:35:27.000
Does anyone have any further information for us?

1849
03:35:27.000 --> 03:35:32.000
I plan on scheduling the other bills for next Wednesday.

1850
03:35:32.000 --> 03:35:34.500
We're good with that, right?

1851
03:35:34.500 --> 03:36:09.000
Do we and and I would for those members that are listening online, I would very much prefer to hear beforehand whether people are intending to show up or listen online for purposes of either getting substitutes or knowing whether we can exact bills or anything that comes along We would like to know so either contact myself the vice chair or our ranking member Yep, that'd be great.

1852
03:36:09.000 --> 03:36:14.500
Thank you very much everyone I honestly don't know what happened.

1853
03:36:14.500 --> 03:36:16.500
I just...

1854
03:36:16.500 --> 03:36:18.500
I don't know.

1855
03:36:18.500 --> 03:36:20.500
I don't know.

1856
03:36:20.500 --> 03:36:22.500
I don't know.

1857
03:36:22.500 --> 03:36:24.500

03:36:29.500 --> 03:36:31.500
Yeah.

1861
03:36:31.500 --> 03:36:34.000
Not this year, I guess.

Yeah.

1863
03:36:36.000 --> 03:36:38.000
Well, it really...

1864
03:36:38.000 --> 03:36:41.500
This is not usually a controversial committee.

1865
03:36:41.500 --> 03:36:43.500
