00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
point and we talked a lot about it and
 
00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:04.359 align:start position:0%
um I told her what our reservations are
 
00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 align:start position:0%
we both felt that it was important and
 
00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:07.399 align:start position:0%
we felt we should work together to
 
00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:08.470 align:start position:0%
we felt we should work together to
create

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
create
 
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
something um at that point um
 
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative lungren um took it took
 
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
up the flag representative py said she
 
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
she wasn't going to do it um for variety
 
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
of reasons and he did and he basically
 
00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 align:start position:0%
took the same bill and I don't really
 
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
know what happened last session I'm a
 
00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 align:start position:0%
little bit lost on this tabled versus
 
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
retained versus whatever but the bill
 
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't killed but it was it was retained
 
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 align:start position:0%
and so he was able to bring it back this
 
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
session in the meantime um we again at
 
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
the med Society legislative committee at
 
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
that point I was not a legislator um we
 
00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 align:start position:0%
looked at this bill in detail and we had
 
00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039 align:start position:0%
a lot of concerns about it but we we
 
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
valued the the premise of it so we
 
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
convened an ad hoc group that consisted
 
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.510 align:start position:0%
convened an ad hoc group that consisted
of

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
myself um U Mike padmore from the med
 
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
Society s Savage um um who I think you
 
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
both know um and um um Cindy Steinberg
 
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
and the reason why we included Cindy was
 
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
that she's a friend of mine we've been
 
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
worked together for years she's the
 
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
legislative director for both the US
 
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 align:start position:0%
pain foundation and the Massachusetts
 
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
pain initiative they'd worked on a
 
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
similar bill in Massachusetts and um um
 
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh or a similar concept very
 
00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
conceptually similar um and so we wanted
 
00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 align:start position:0%
to build on what they had done and the
 
00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 align:start position:0%
ne thing about the Massachusetts bill is
 
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 align:start position:0%
that as a result of that or direct
 
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
result of that it's increased access to
 
00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of these
 
00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
Services um in in a very public way and
 
00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
so it really has had good
 
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
ramifications so we we sat down went
 
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
through the whole thing together and to
 
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
be honest we eliminated about 90% of his
 
00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
bill and um um um like for example the
 
00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
first opening paragraph of this bill is
 
00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
just a premise that says a doctor May do
 
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 align:start position:0%
all this well we may do it now anyways
 
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
and then the second premise is we have
 
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
to fill a form out you know which is
 
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
totally voluntary and and
 
00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 align:start position:0%
superficially that frankly is
 
00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 align:start position:0%
micromanaging medicine and and the
 
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
medical society was totally opposed to
 
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
that I was totally opposed to that um
 
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
the voluntary element of it didn't make
 
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
any sense to me and um and the other
 
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
little Minor Detail is if you look at
 
00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 align:start position:0%
the controlled substance Act and the
 
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
rules that are in the controlled
 
00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
substance Act we have to do that already
 
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
so it's already in statute it really
 
00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
didn't make any sense so as we kept
 
00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
going through it you know it kept
 
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
getting more and more bogged down and
 
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
then he the bill goes into um you know
 
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 align:start position:0%
the alternative services that can or
 
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
should be provided or whatever and so at
 
00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
that point we're starting to realize
 
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
yeah that has value but not the way it's
 
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
written so what we decided to do we had
 
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
we had to make we had decide on our
 
00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
strategy did we want to just re write
 
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
the entire Bill did we want to work with
 
00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
him on the bill who did we want to work
 
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
with so we brought together a whole
 
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
bunch of stakeholders the uh New
 
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire acupuncture Association New
 
00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Chiropractic
 
00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 align:start position:0%
Association um the psych people I can't
 
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 align:start position:0%
remember what their acronym is but um
 
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
and we brought together all these people
 
00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 align:start position:0%
and figured it out and that's where 303
 
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
came from House Bill 303 it was all of
 
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
us working together to come up with this
 
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.190 align:start position:0%
us working together to come up with this
bill

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
so then we I we we tried to include um
 
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
representative lungren in those
 
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
discussions um we we eventually shared
 
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
303 with him and said we need to
 
00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
reconcile these two bills and in the end
 
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
um we never got a response and in the
 
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 align:start position:0%
end all he did was he added 303 to the
 
00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 align:start position:0%
end of his bill and so at this point um
 
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
I didn't even know he was going to do
 
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
that and so um the deadline was
 
00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
approaching so I just submitted 303 cuz
 
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
I thought I was losing my window and
 
00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
then all of a sudden 303 goes into
 
00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
Commerce and I don't really fully get
 
00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
why this bill came to
 
00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 align:start position:0%
HHS I I understand the opening part yes
 
00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 align:start position:0%
but the second part's Commerce so I
 
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 align:start position:0%
didn't understand that but then that
 
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
bill came to us so um at this point what
 
00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 align:start position:0%
I kind of think we really need to do is
 
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
number one is decide can we reconcile
 
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
these two bills and the reason why I
 
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
think it's I I really appreciate
 
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
everything representative maputi and
 
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative lren have done it's like
 
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
really important their actions have
 
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
actually spawned two bills they
 
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
spawned 303 and they also spawned 66 and
 
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
they really deserve a lot of credit for
 
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
that and I really appreciate that at the
 
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.990 align:start position:0%
that and I really appreciate that at the
same

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
point I think the bill has a lot of
 
00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 align:start position:0%
flaws that
 
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
303 and there's an amended version of
 
00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
303 303 will not pass as is but we've
 
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
amended it and we think it has some
 
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
value that and the insurers and us find
 
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
valuable um I I haven't talked to you
 
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
guys yet about that stuff but um at the
 
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
same point we really recognize their
 
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
issues as well as ours and so um I think
 
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where we're at do we want
 
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
to go through this bill piece by piece
 
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
and cross out stuff and try to salvage
 
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
what's left or do we want to itl it and
 
00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
just go with
 
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
303 I think represent no repr I'll just
 
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
leave it at that that's all I have to
 
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
say so 303 is still before Commerce
 
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
correct and that was retained by
 
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.950 align:start position:0%
correct and that was retained by
Commerce

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
yes um we've they had a hearing about
 
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
that I I I it's not up to me to speak
 
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
for them
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
um there's a there is a lot of support
 
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
for it um and that's why the amendment's
 
00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
important because the original Bell had
 
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of shout
 
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
the shells got changed to Maze and
 
00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the big change in that um
 
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
um um and the other thing that was also
 
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
important that was critical in terms of
 
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
our discussions is that any
 
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
services that were included in this had
 
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
to be provided by licensed
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
practitioners so and I agree with that I
 
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 align:start position:0%
think that makes total sense so there
 
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
were movement therapies like Chiang um
 
00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 align:start position:0%
Tai Chi there's mindbody therapies that
 
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
are in there none of that's done by a
 
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
licensed provider so and yoga is in
 
00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
there also um with that all was
 
00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 align:start position:0%
removed um the Behavioral Medicine was
 
00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:40.670 align:start position:0%
removed um the Behavioral Medicine was
included

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
um um acupuncture massage
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic um this bill also includes
 
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
Physical Therapy um and occupational
 
00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:54.759 align:start position:0%
therapy and naturopathy and I don't know
 
00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
that those things are necessary because
 
00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 align:start position:0%
they're covered
 
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
elsewhere um but we can if you want we
 
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
can go through this paragraph by
 
00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:04.919 align:start position:0%
paragraph or whatever you want to do but
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
I want to hear what you guys think I
 
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
guess the question I'd asked the
 
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
committee repr Nagel we have House Bill
 
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
66 there's a committee working on this
 
00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:19.879 align:start position:0%
somewhat I find the commonality but also
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
where the two
 
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
diverge the commonality as we're talking
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
about trying to find ways to help
 
00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:27.879 align:start position:0%
patients with nonopiate
 
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 align:start position:0%
processes in a lot of goes back to
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
chronic pain the difference I see here
 
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
though this is looking at it broadly and
 
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
not trying to come up with a pilot
 
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
program and my concern is that when you
 
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
start looking at things broadly because
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
it's sort of untested we don't have a
 
00:07:47.309 --> 00:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
lot of um documentation to support the
 
00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
expansion of it is it better for us to
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
continue to work with House Bill 66
 
00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
which is coming out of the committee and
 
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
take that recommendation from the
 
00:07:59.589 --> 00:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
committee and build into that pilot
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
program some of the principles you have
 
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:08.879 align:start position:0%
303 and and I will say that you know
 
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
everybody I I travel all over the
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
country speaking on these issues and we
 
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
use the alternative to opioids as a flag
 
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
waving thing to get people's attention
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
it's really not the reason why this bill
 
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
is here this bill is here is because
 
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
chiropractors feel that they've been cut
 
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
out of the pie and they want back in and
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
and that's the real reason and and you
 
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
know that that's the the base reason why
 
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
this bill exists the and they decided to
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
include all these other folks as well um
 
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
you know my only concern with HP 66 is
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
like what population of people are we
 
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:49.240 align:start position:0%
trying to serve with that we're looking
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
at integrative models of care for
 
00:08:53.949 --> 00:08:53.959 align:start position:0%
complex problems chiropractors and
 
00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist want to be included with
 
00:08:58.910 --> 00:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
the simple problems too like for example
 
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
when I negotiated a contract years ago
 
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
with Health Source to cover
 
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
acupuncture they made a stipulation that
 
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
the only patients that I could see were
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
the patients that had failed everything
 
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
else which is like okay great give me a
 
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
patient that I'm not going to succeed
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
with either it made no sense but you
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
know you you take what you can get um
 
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
they want access to patients a lot
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
earlier than that and I think HB 66 is
 
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
really dealing with people who are more
 
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
complicated if I'm not
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
if if if we're trying to through HB
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
303 to expand it so we
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
have more opportunity for patients to go
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
to a chiropractor or go to acupunctur I
 
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
would say at that point in time narrow
 
00:09:49.069 --> 00:09:49.079 align:start position:0%
the scope down to that and that only and
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
then so take 303 pair it back and at
 
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
that point in time that makes sense to
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
me yeah we paired 303 back quite a bit
 
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
and we can pair it back more there's
 
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
like Behavioral Medicine and massage in
 
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
there yeah
 
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
um we've really not gotten any inclusion
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
in our efforts from the folks from
 
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
behavioral Med although they're very
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
thrilled that we included them I've got
 
00:10:17.069 --> 00:10:17.079 align:start position:0%
virtually no feedback from massage folks
 
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:19.240 align:start position:0%
so but the chiropractors and acupunctur
 
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
have been intimately involved with the
 
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
entire process and I I I kind of wish
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
that they were here um I to speak for
 
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
themselves cuz I don't feel comfortable
 
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
speaking for them um so I won't say what
 
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
they think but um I know what they
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
think but again if it says may instead
 
00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:40.839 align:start position:0%
of shall right my understanding is most
 
00:10:43.389 --> 00:10:43.399 align:start position:0%
of the health care policies out there
 
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do it which is May
 
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
and therefore I'm not sure exactly what
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
this will achieve because the insurance
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
companies can may do it today if they
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
want to which is different than shall
 
00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:55.959 align:start position:0%
which is a
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
mandate um I yes
 
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
this was
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
I that's a long story about how it got
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
from sh's De Ma and I
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
I um with great reluctance I agreed to
 
00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:21.639 align:start position:0%
that so
 
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
um thanks for bringing me up two things
 
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
the the behavioral health just I mean um
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
I've been studying for the boards and um
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
for a great many conditions including
 
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:37.240 align:start position:0%
chronic pain that's definitely one of
 
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
the recommended things and it's one of
 
00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
the things that's very hard to get and
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
admittedly in rural areas one of the
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
reasons is I mean has less to do with
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
well I guess maybe it has to do with
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
insurance company insurance coverage but
 
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
there just aren't the practitioners a
 
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
lot of the time
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
um now I forgot what the other thing was
 
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
um oh and the only thing the other thing
 
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
was um does was changing from sh to May
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
does that mean that we're looking at
 
00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.790 align:start position:0%
does that mean that we're looking at
prior

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
prior
 
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.310 align:start position:0%
prior
off

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
off
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
because that's the
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
evil um that's a totally interestingly
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
great segue to a very separate very
 
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
long-winded very heavily multi-person
 
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
involved discussion that I think is
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
above and beyond what we're talking
 
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
about here but I don't disagree I mean
 
00:12:32.189 --> 00:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
even if it's a shall or it's a may
 
00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:33.399 align:start position:0%
there's still could be a prior
 
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
authorization one way or the other I um
 
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
I mean I think the prior authorization
 
00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:40.839 align:start position:0%
issue is something that we really want
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
to resolve as a group you know not just
 
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
you know us against them type thing
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
because it is a problem for everybody
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair one of the things I learned
 
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
along this journey that I found
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
fascinating when you think about what
 
00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
state of law actually can govern within
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
Healthcare insurance it's a small slice
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
of the pie because we cannot impact
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
Medicare A lot of things with Orissa are
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
outside of the scope of it so when you
 
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:11.240 align:start position:0%
start thinking about the large or small
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
employer Marketplace and so forth is
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
probably M scoll if you can help me out
 
00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
here with these numbers but I believe
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
it's probably around 30% if that so when
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
we when you talk about things here we
 
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
want actually to impact that the patient
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
level It's relatively small slice of the
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
pie not small but 25 to 30% of the
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
pie 25 thank you I'm going about to say
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
something nice to you guys but like um I
 
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:43.160 align:start position:0%
I really seriously believe that um our
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
Health Care system is headed in a wrong
 
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
direction I think we're seeing both
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
Corporation in health care and
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
insurance and and I personally think
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
that the private insurers have an
 
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
incredibly important role to play as we
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
go forward and I'm really concerned
 
00:13:59.470 --> 00:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
about doing anything that would
 
00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
adversely affect their role so I do
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
respect what you guys do um and and
 
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:07.240 align:start position:0%
that's one of the other reasons for the
 
00:14:11.069 --> 00:14:11.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:15.399 align:start position:0%
um so but I'm sorry I go ahead go ahead
 
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:18.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry so just um for strategy so we
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
have 554 which is
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
basically uh representative lungren Bill
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
plus 303 tacked on to it and then 303
 
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
and is there a rational having sort of
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
the same bill in two different
 
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
committees and if if if so I mean would
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
it I mean would you look at like just
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
amending 554 to being more like just
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
or I I'm G to let you answer that
 
00:14:53.949 --> 00:14:53.959 align:start position:0%
because I don't know I I that's
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
something I've really struggled with I
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
get to because I'm a freshman I get to
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
ask question
 
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
this it's a really great question uh if
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
that was to occur the way I would read
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
that we'd have literally two competing
 
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
bills one in Commerce and one in Health
 
00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:14.959 align:start position:0%
Human Services and LLY Affairs and
 
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
unless both committees pass it it's
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
probably going to have a challenge on
 
00:15:22.829 --> 00:15:22.839 align:start position:0%
the floor it's depending upon how they
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
come out of the committee and what
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
happens at that point in time when the
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
scheduling process so if you want to
 
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
look at retaining or at least working on
 
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
303 and coming out of this committee
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
then I would to representative Palmer's
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
point which is a good one is to strip
 
00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:41.389 align:start position:0%
point which is a good one is to strip
out

00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:15:45.629 --> 00:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
504 and leave in it only
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
303 and that way there we have at least
 
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:49.959 align:start position:0%
a shot of it getting through this
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
committee to get onto the floor but
 
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
after to recognize it's also in Commerce
 
00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
it may come out of the Commerce with the
 
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
competing recommend Commendation
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
so wow I mean this is what my thinking
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
was coming into our meeting today was I
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
I went I don't know what I did with it
 
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
but I have a copy of this that I exed
 
00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
out a lot of the I mean basically when I
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
it's no different I actually looked at
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
my copy of this from five years ago and
 
00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
I went through the same thing did the
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
same thing and I exed out that whole
 
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
reporting stuff which is about a third
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
of the bill I decided when he looked at
 
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
all all of how his insurance coverage
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
stuff I said this is kind of nebulous
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
and hard to follow it's better described
 
00:16:36.749 --> 00:16:36.759 align:start position:0%
in 303 so I eliminated that twitched it
 
00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
over to 303 and then the opening preface
 
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
while I think it has value it really
 
00:16:43.629 --> 00:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anything because I can do it
 
00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
already so it didn't it didn't change
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
medical it made no sense to me to put
 
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
something in a statue that already
 
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
exists so basically in the end all I had
 
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
was 303 that was left and and then I was
 
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
thinking well I was going to cross out
 
00:16:59.710 --> 00:16:59.720 align:start position:0%
303 total because I didn't think it
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
should be in two bills and all of a
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
sudden I don't have a bill at all you
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
know except a title and um and so in the
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
end my recommendation was to itl this
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
and let it go through Commerce and I
 
00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:12.039 align:start position:0%
really didn't want to do that because I
 
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
really appreciate everything that do
 
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
represented lr's done I think is
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
important but and this is really
 
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
important to him and I really wish we'd
 
00:17:23.549 --> 00:17:23.559 align:start position:0%
had a much better you know communication
 
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
about this from the very beginning but
 
00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
it didn't happen so I so I I think we
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
have two options we either it all this
 
00:17:32.909 --> 00:17:32.919 align:start position:0%
go with Commerce or we strip out a lot
 
00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
of this and then have two competing
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
Bills or the other thing I think you
 
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
could possibly do is talk to the
 
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
chairman of Commerce and see if they
 
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
willing to um redirect that 303 back
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
here given the fact that we're going to
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
fundamentally we take out 504 have 303
 
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
and two committees and ask at that point
 
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
in time would he redirect it over here
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
if that's possible um we can ask and I'm
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:05.799 align:start position:0%
answer that but we've had that
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
discussion and the other the other issue
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
concern ourselves with the fact that we
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
have two bills that are comparable to
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
each other the wording in each bill may
 
00:18:18.029 --> 00:18:18.039 align:start position:0%
not be identical so therefore when it
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
gets to that point in time my
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
understanding is it's the last version
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
that gets past it becomes the uh
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
Foundation upon which we do things but
 
00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
don't forget this even if it goes out of
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
Senate I'm kind of really starting to
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.149 --> 00:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we just except that we
 
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
our recommendation is to keep the
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
amended version of 303 and eliminate
 
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.590 align:start position:0%
amended version of 303 and eliminate
everything

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
else that would my recommendation is
 
00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
take 504
 
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
out 554 sorry and then at that point in
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
time leave 303 and we'll run the risk at
 
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
that point in time of having two bills
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
um so um I'm sorry go ahead bill you I'm
 
00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:13.750 align:start position:0%
um so um I'm sorry go ahead bill you I'm
I'm

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:15.799 align:start position:0%
monopolizing well and we don't and we
 
00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
don't know if com Commerce may itl this
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
bill so it may not
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
so that is so smart and I'll be honest
 
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
you know um I I've been so empowered
 
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
with a lot of the stuff that I've been
 
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
doing because I get this impression that
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
there's this stigma in the in this in
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
against people in pain in the
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
legislature and and I think it's a false
 
00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
perception because like between the opio
 
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
to baitman commission meetings when you
 
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
know you start with a single voice
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
questioning what we're doing and why
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
we're doing it and then all of a sudden
 
00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
people start coming gradually out of the
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
closet and saying you know what you're
 
00:19:56.669 --> 00:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
right and on the house floor when we
 
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
looked at that whole issue of harm red
 
00:19:59.950 --> 00:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
uction and people started coming out of
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
the closet just because people on the
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee and I'm not saying
 
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
that they would vote against this bill
 
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:07.799 align:start position:0%
but you know it may be that we have a
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
lot more support than we think we've got
 
00:20:12.029 --> 00:20:12.039 align:start position:0%
because everybody has
 
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
pain and um I mean if you don't you're
 
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
weird but not everybody has chronic pain
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of people in the
 
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
legislature that do have chronic pain or
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
know somebody
 
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
does so are we leaning towards a
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation to strip out 550 4 and
 
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
leave 303 but it's still called 554
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
correct yes yeah which is which that
 
00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
would be my dream and I think that could
 
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
be helpful strategically because if it's
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
554 it's not the same as 303
 
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
so and and and so this would require an
 
00:20:51.549 --> 00:20:51.559 align:start position:0%
amendment that we would have to write
 
00:20:54.029 --> 00:20:54.039 align:start position:0%
and that um and and and I would probably
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
make because the the amendment that I
 
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
gave to you guys I wrote so um but it
 
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
was it was given to me by um folks in
 
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
Commerce after their meeting that they
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
were leaning towards supporting it with
 
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
the Maze and shs the next question is
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
should I leave the shs in and our bill
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.070 align:start position:0%
 
maze

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
maze
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
um so on my notes here when we when we
 
00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.630 align:start position:0%
um so on my notes here when we when we
heard

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
554 um I there there's the May and I I
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
had um I think people questioned whether
 
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
um it's a tough call I I mean I again it
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
I don't want to
 
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
ostracize do we have public hearing at
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
these things all of the
 
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
chair I mean more than happy to hear
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
from either of you guys if you want to
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
say share your
 
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
thoughts I should have done that right
 
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
in the beginning I'm sorry I'm not good
 
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
at this oh I did get my picture taken up
 
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
exciting be honest this is the way I
 
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
look at things um I just think that
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
we're we should be one big happy family
 
00:22:15.149 --> 00:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
I know we have differences of opinion on
 
00:22:18.029 --> 00:22:18.039 align:start position:0%
stuff it seems to me that the the shell
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
is a better at this point than a May
 
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
thing um and that's why it would kind of
 
00:22:24.909 --> 00:22:24.919 align:start position:0%
I mean the May is better than a shell
 
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
whatever you know what I meant um and I
 
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
would lean towards just leing it the way
 
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
I have it amended and because that was
 
00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:32.039 align:start position:0%
the recommendation that was given to me
 
00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
by the folks in
 
00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
Commerce I I think from
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
a strategy point of view there'll be
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
less opposition to the word may than the
 
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:45.400 align:start position:0%
word shall secondly if it becomes a
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
mandate because of the word shell then I
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
don't know what that does
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
with the um Affordable Care Act because
 
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
the certain things in provision within
 
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
the federal government government versus
 
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
state government so state does certain
 
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
things that is beyond the maintenance of
 
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
the federal government how that works
 
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
out that I don't know but the word may
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
minimizes that
 
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
impact um the other thing I do want to
 
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
point out also is that the language that
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
at the end of the 303 section which
 
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
talks about and and you guys have
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
educated me a lot on this but the
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
insurers have to provide transparent
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
information about what you have for
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
services available and things like that
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
our reasoning behind that is that you
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
know um we're trying to
 
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
empower we have this General belief that
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
patients really don't get the care that
 
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
they need in an integrative way and the
 
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
only way they can get it is to empower
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
them with the knowledge that they need
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
to manage their own problems and so um
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
that language is basically in there to
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
empower them to know what their
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
insurance is provide them um that
 
00:23:59.789 --> 00:23:59.799 align:start position:0%
language in Massachusetts I think was
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
largely responsible for increasing
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
access to certain services that they
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have gotten otherwise although
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts there was a mandate I
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
believe that they had to provide one of
 
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
these things um and that was a
 
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
compromise over a long period of time um
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
we're under the understanding that many
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
of these policies already include some
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
of these things um we put an the other
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
thing is that we discussed the number
 
00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
the amended version took the number from
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
20 of each of these things per year to
 
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
12 and that was a compromise also I was
 
00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
going to ask that question as well R of
 
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
Nel it says 12 from
 
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
each versus 20 in total 12 in total
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
versus if you take 12 times whatever the
 
00:24:49.389 --> 00:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
each is that could be 36 to 48 so it's
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
in how to tweak it and saying are we
 
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
looking at being prescriptive and saying
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
has to come from each one or we looking
 
00:24:59.470 --> 00:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
at saying there's the basket of 20 and
 
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
the patient or the provider has the
 
00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to choose amongst the 20 and
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
use them accordingly because some
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
patients may want more than 12 with
 
00:25:09.389 --> 00:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
acupuncture but you can't do that
 
00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:11.240 align:start position:0%
because 12's sort of the limit if you
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
make it 20 or 24 whatever it may
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
be collectively in the aggregate that
 
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
allows more
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
flexibility I think if you're going to
 
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
do that I would make a number higher
 
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
than 20 but I don't disagree with what
 
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
you're saying I mean for some patients
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
they just need one of these things for
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
other patients they're going to need all
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
three together you know like we have a
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
lot of chronic pain patients that we
 
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
need a behavioral therapy plus uh
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic or osteopathic adjustment
 
00:25:42.389 --> 00:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
the reason why osteopathy wasn't
 
00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:43.799 align:start position:0%
included in this was because they
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
already have their own thing but um or
 
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
PT for that matter too I mean you know I
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
mean we thought about including them
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
also but they're already separately
 
00:25:54.669 --> 00:25:54.679 align:start position:0%
included they weren't part of this
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
discussion but um but yeah a lot of
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
patients get multiple modalities at the
 
00:26:01.389 --> 00:26:01.399 align:start position:0%
same time and and so if we come up with
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
a number I would use the number 36 that
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
would be the number I would pick if we
 
00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
say cumulative total 36 I think is a
 
00:26:09.279 --> 00:26:10.470 align:start position:0%
say cumulative total 36 I think is a
reasonable

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:14.070 align:start position:0%
reasonable
number

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
um and you know the other little Minor
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
Detail that we learned at our L last HB
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
66 meeting sorry we're speaking behind
 
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
your back a little bit on this
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
representative palmer but like um you
 
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
know the worst person you're going to go
 
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
see for an acute back problem is a spine
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
surgeon because they're expensive and
 
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
they don't know anything and it's
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
nothing personal but if you don't need
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
surgery they don't know anything about
 
00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
conservative care and granted there's
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
some that do but for the most part
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
they've never even been in a PT gym so
 
00:26:47.389 --> 00:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
or certainly at a chiropractor's office
 
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
and they always talk about the magic of
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
physiatry and I always say it's fun to
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
read their notes because they talk about
 
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
oh we're going to send them to physiatry
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
for whatever it is they do and I was
 
00:27:00.029 --> 00:27:00.039 align:start position:0%
like going I don't know what it is that
 
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
I do but I'm I'm glad that I'm magical
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
but um but they showed us data that
 
00:27:10.389 --> 00:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
chiropractor fory cute back problem
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
especially with the way chiropractors
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
are now as opposed to the way they were
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
historically historically it was like
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
shake and bake type stuff but but now
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's really more holistic Ken and
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
and it's much more cost effective than
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
even in a physical therapist and part of
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
the reason why I think there and I is
 
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
that pts are dependent on a doctor's
 
00:27:36.669 --> 00:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
script and I think that's a problem that
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed also but at the same
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
point it's much more coste effective to
 
00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:45.039 align:start position:0%
do it that way um as an acupuncturist my
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
best outcomes were seeing people right
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
away not like three years later you know
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
to see them right away before they're
 
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
neurologically plasticized so that
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
there's really very little I can do for
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
them you know um and I want to have
 
00:28:03.509 --> 00:28:03.519 align:start position:0%
access to those people now not later and
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
I think I can be a lot
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
cheaper than a you know an orthopedic
 
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
surgeon or or whatever um mostly because
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
an orthop guy is expensive yeah um one
 
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
of the um if I may there's still a word
 
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
shell if you look at the uh second sheet
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
if you will where it has the number of
 
00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
visits oh is that you want to retain
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
that as shall or you talking about May
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
are you on the um U number two policies
 
00:28:35.389 --> 00:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
issued and
 
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
renewed um I'm sorry you on the actual
 
00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:44.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.519 --> 00:28:46.750 align:start position:0%
 
Amendment

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:49.480 align:start position:0%
see because if you go down to page two
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
afterwards on four it talks about May
 
00:28:59.230 --> 00:28:59.240 align:start position:0%
provide so they're not consistent
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:16.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:18.269 --> 00:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
right hang around with smart people like
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:31.389 align:start position:0%
 
guy

00:29:31.389 --> 00:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
if we're in agreement then I'll prepare
 
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
an amendment to this bill that we're
 
00:29:36.909 --> 00:29:36.919 align:start position:0%
going to just stick with the 303
 
00:29:38.669 --> 00:29:38.679 align:start position:0%
language eliminate everything else and
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
that way we get everything because
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
representative lr's name stays on the
 
00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
bill which is really important to me um
 
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:49.720 align:start position:0%
so is that
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
fair sure yeah I think you have to
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.990 align:start position:0%
 
recorded

00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
recorded
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
the brains of this whole operation are
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
behind that laptop over there she's not
 
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.350 align:start position:0%
behind that laptop over there she's not
listening

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
listening
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
um good morning uh let me move over so I
 
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
can a little bit um good morning uh my
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
name is Heidi croll I work at Gallagher
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
C Hanah gartell and I represent um ahip
 
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
which is America's health insurance
 
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
plans and we've been you know
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
participating in the house bill 66 um
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
study committee work um and so
 
00:30:27.789 --> 00:30:27.799 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity so um
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
H having been in the Commerce side of
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
this and getting bits and pieces of the
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
conversation that um I wasn't directly
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
part of the conversation get getting
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
bits and pieces about the conversation
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
about maybe changing the shells to maze
 
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
um I think chairman hunt
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
has um a paired down version in his mind
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
of what that meant to him versus what
 
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
this might reflect
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
um so I think what he was looking toward
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
is uh in other areas of the statute
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
where we already do have coverage for
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
like PT OT chiropractors that sort of
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
thing just trying to
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
mirror that exist using that kind of as
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
a template and mirroring that for some
 
00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
of these other
 
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
um uh providers or Services um with the
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
May in instead of shs so um for example
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
in this draft there's um a section that
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
kind of addresses network adequacy but
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
we already have laws on the books um
 
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
around Network adequacy so like that
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
piece wouldn't be necessary as an
 
00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:45.230 align:start position:0%
piece wouldn't be necessary as an
example

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.149 --> 00:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
um sorry I'm gonna pull this staple
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.159 --> 00:31:58.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
just to make sure I understand you're
 
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment that I wrote up
 
00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.710 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment that I wrote up
yes

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:26.070 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:34.789 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
so this is
 
00:32:38.789 --> 00:32:38.799 align:start position:0%
in um excuse me I've got a frog in my
 
00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:42.519 align:start position:0%
throat this is in Roman 5 on for me it's
 
00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
page two um and it would be replicated
 
00:32:48.629 --> 00:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
um later um so there's different
 
00:32:51.789 --> 00:32:51.799 align:start position:0%
statutes one for um the individual
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
market and then one for um group The
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
Group market of insurance um
 
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
um so it it's it's repeated um later in
 
00:33:03.909 --> 00:33:03.919 align:start position:0%
the bill as well but that's the ad the
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
you know the network adequacy piece that
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
that would not be necessary um I mean I
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
think the other pieces in here like
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
filing I think there's a piece in here
 
00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
about filing a comprehensive plan
 
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
um uh Pain Services management plan with
 
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
the Department that has to be approved
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
and that like I think those kind of
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
components like I I don't know that
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt was envisioning okay those
 
00:33:32.269 --> 00:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
sorts of other things I think he was
 
00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:35.559 align:start position:0%
thinking of a very kind of paired back
 
00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
more so anyway I just wanted to to flag
 
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
that for you folks
 
00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
um that that might no I really
 
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um and I really feel bad
 
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
because I haven't been able to attend
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
any of those meetings and um I'm
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
planning on doing my best to get to the
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
next one so at least I can listen to
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
what they're saying if not participating
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
so just just um so you're aware so the
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
committee so there was a um a full
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
committee had um a work session I guess
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
if you will on all of their retain bills
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
so during the work session the decision
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
was to retain um continue to retain uh
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
um uh 303 and so I think it was only
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
afterwards um when the committee had
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
dispersed um that um uh
 
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative collabor yes thank you um
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
had mentioned to to representative hunt
 
00:34:38.349 --> 00:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
that she might be interested in I guess
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
maybe trying to do something with it so
 
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
it was very much a kind of a sidebar
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
conversation it was not a discussion
 
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:47.560 align:start position:0%
amongst the the whole committee so it
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
was one of these ideas kind of a three
 
00:34:52.589 --> 00:34:52.599 align:start position:0%
minute conversation kind of over on the
 
00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:54.919 align:start position:0%
side of the room so anyway just to to
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
let you know but um I think there are
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
pieces in here that um either duplicate
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
what we already have in current law or
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
would conflict with what we current H
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
have in current law or just kind of went
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
outside of the scope of what the
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
chairman might have been thinking that
 
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
where his vision was going so um and for
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
example like with chiro Chiropractic
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
services like we already have something
 
00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
on the on the books around that um and I
 
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
just did want to say I went was digging
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
through my emails before um when know
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
was sitting there listening to you so
 
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
um not this past summer but the summer
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
before there's this ad hoc group that I
 
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
think both of you were part of um around
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
this same topic and so a pres we the
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
insurance companies gave a
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
presentation um which we will probably
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
give a similar version of um to the
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
houseful 66 committee at some point um
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that we had was um
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
a little chart that we gave you about
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
what the insurance company um currently
 
00:35:59.309 --> 00:35:59.319 align:start position:0%
do cover because I think there is kind
 
00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:01.880 align:start position:0%
of a Mis understanding
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
or a tendency to think we're not
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
covering anything when in fact we are
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
you know covering so um Chiropractic
 
00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
Services um are covered PT is covered um
 
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
tens units um are covered acupuncture
 
00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
coverage varies and the other thing I
 
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
think to keep in mind is that
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
um you know carriers have many different
 
00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
plans that they offer so um part of that
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
is that some plans um might have
 
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
coverage and other plans might not and
 
00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:38.079 align:start position:0%
for people to make a decision about you
 
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
know is it something they want included
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
in their coverage or not and and they've
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
weighed the premiums and they weigh the
 
00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
services that are included so um
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
acupuncture coverage varies um gym
 
00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:52.839 align:start position:0%
membership coverage varies uh
 
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
massage um as a standalone service tends
 
00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
not to be covered but if it is part of
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh Cairo or PT or OT then it is covered
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
so again this is you know I don't get to
 
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
go with my girlfriends to the spa and
 
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
get my massage covered by Insurance um
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
and then uh meditation This was um
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
another thing that we had provided um
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
each of the insurance companies or the
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
major ones anyway that that help pull
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
this together um Harvard Pilgrim um
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
Sigma and Anthem all have a wealth of
 
00:37:30.109 --> 00:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
resources on their websites um around um
 
00:37:32.309 --> 00:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
uh meditation and
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
um kind of um management
 
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.510 align:start position:0%
um kind of um management
[Music]

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
um techniques that people can use um so
 
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
they offer written materials videos and
 
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
that's all for free on their websites
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
and it's not limited to members so
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
anybody could be doing a Google search
 
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
and find that so I just wanted to kind
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
of remind folks that there is quite a
 
00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:56.200 align:start position:0%
bit of coverage already um I think the
 
00:37:59.470 --> 00:37:59.480 align:start position:0%
piece that the house bll 66 study has
 
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
been working on is more of the
 
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
integrated piece around that so um
 
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
anyway I'm happy to try to answer any
 
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
questions but I just wanted to share
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
that with you yes thank you Mr chair and
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
question one of the things that I
 
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
believe is starting to come to my
 
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:24.280 align:start position:0%
attention anyways and me getting to
 
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
understand from a patient's point of
 
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
view it's hard to understand what they
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
have in their plan per se because
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's so many labors of
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
plans is there any way we could can
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
begin to think
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
about standardizations give an example
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
of something with Medicare you have
 
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
different supplemental insurance options
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
but each one of the options a b c and so
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
forth they're standardized within that
 
00:38:56.079 --> 00:38:57.150 align:start position:0%
forth they're standardized within that
option

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
option
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
so the patient begins to understand if
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
you take that option what you're going
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
to have for an option regardless of your
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
supplemental coverage is there any way
 
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire we could begin to
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
think about some of this and saying
 
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
these are the
 
00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
standards and all you have to do at that
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
point in time is if you want to offer
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
standard a these are what's in the plan
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
if you want B that's what's in the plan
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
to help minimize the fragmentation about
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
um I think part of the challenge with
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
that is that you know this is a
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
competitive market so um I think there
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
is a lot of commonality
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
across plans that carriers offer whether
 
00:39:53.069 --> 00:39:53.079 align:start position:0%
it's in the individual Market or in the
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
small group or large group markets and
 
00:39:57.069 --> 00:39:57.079 align:start position:0%
again these are all the fully insured
 
00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
products um as you mentioned
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
um self-funded um is you know that's
 
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
those are employer sponsored where the
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
employer is taking the risk um and so
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
they have a lot more um freedom to
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
develop their plans and what they're
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
going to cover and that sort of thing
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
but um so in terms of standardizing I'm
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
not sure just because it is a
 
00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
competitive market but I do know that um
 
00:40:27.069 --> 00:40:27.079 align:start position:0%
plans do make available to the me ERS
 
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
you know there's a kind of a a chart um
 
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
I get it every year you know through my
 
00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:34.359 align:start position:0%
employer um of what's covered and
 
00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
co-pays and that sort of thing so you
 
00:40:38.829 --> 00:40:38.839 align:start position:0%
know they do try to simplify it as much
 
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
as possible in terms of what is covered
 
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
and um any if if there is a member um
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
co-pay or or co- inssurance follow up
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you I do understand the issue
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
about Market
 
00:40:56.349 --> 00:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
competition however if each one of the
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
plans is
 
00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%
standardized at that point in time the
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
competition would be the same because if
 
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to offer plan a you're
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
competing on plan a if you want B you're
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
still competing with Plan B I think from
 
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
a patience point of view it allows them
 
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
to understand the variance between them
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
and starts to narrow down so
 
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
sanitization I think by itself would not
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
prohibit competition probably would
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
encourage competition increase the
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
competition within that particular
 
00:41:31.309 --> 00:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
standard yeah and I think I think um I
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
mean like when people are going onto the
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
um into the ACA Marketplace you know
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
there there are standard formats where
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
people can look and look at those the
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
charts that I'm talking about and
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
compare and contrast so I think that's
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
there um but I'm not
 
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
sure we're going so far as to mandate
 
00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
that every single carrier has to offer
 
00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
plan A B C and D and in those a plans
 
00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
ABC and D are these
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
elements gets a little um my intent was
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
not to force the carrier to offer a b c
 
00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
d and so forth but if you're going to
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
offer a this is the bundle of things
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
that you're offering to the patient
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
population and therefore the competition
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
is based upon the bundle yeah not based
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
upon the individual fragmentation at
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
that point in time is trying to help the
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
consumer become more educated about how
 
00:42:28.349 --> 00:42:28.359 align:start position:0%
to compare plan a to plan B A lot of
 
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
times consumer is not the patient
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
yeah well I mean I'm just thinking of
 
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
going back to
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
um Medicare and the problem I one of the
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
big problems I think is not so much you
 
00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
know that plans offer you know that you
 
00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
can look up in your plan and see what's
 
00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
there is that nobody looks and Medicare
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
um for example there's the 3-day rule so
 
00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
you have to be hospitalized for three
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
acute days before you qualify for a
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
swing stay in in most circumstances and
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
that's kind of across the board and the
 
00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
number of Medicare patients
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
who understand that rule when they end
 
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
up in the hospital is about zero and so
 
00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
I I mean I I think a transparency is is
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
really important but probably in order
 
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
to get to having
 
00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:25.640 align:start position:0%
people understand and the other thing I
 
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
was thinking is this way is like um I'd
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
be looking at a plan and i' I'd go
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic I I I'm not going to need
 
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
that but little do I know that when I
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
stack firewood next winter I'm going to
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
change my mind so I mean I think it's a
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
little I mean it's great when there's a
 
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
chart you can look at and decide up
 
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
front if particularly if you know
 
00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.510 align:start position:0%
front if particularly if you know
conditions

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
but I yeah I mean
 
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
um I guess when I'm thinking is like how
 
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
making sure that services are available
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
that are you know medically accepted and
 
00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:09.800 align:start position:0%
proven is is I think the thing that is
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
really most important and then
 
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
um I think then patients are going to be
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
sort of in the same boat of in and when
 
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
they're trying to pick a plan if when
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
they have a choice
 
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
um um
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
having to find out having to ask their
 
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
know I just so you know I'm sorry did
 
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
say uh that is covered I mean there we
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
we do have we do have that in law sorry
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
that was I picked a bad example
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
Y and yeah I it's
 
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
it's I'm I'm I'm about to turn 65 I know
 
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%
I don't look it I have to pick medic
 
00:44:59.069 --> 00:44:59.079 align:start position:0%
care plans and I'm clueless so I I I you
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
know in the b in the end basically
 
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:02.200 align:start position:0%
people just look at the dollar figure
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
they're going to pay and it's amazing
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
every day that all the patient come in
 
00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
he says you know what I had no idea I
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
just know what I could afford and I
 
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
never even looked at anything else but
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
that and I don't know how you solve that
 
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
problem because unfortunately I think
 
00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
it's becoming more and more and more
 
00:45:20.829 --> 00:45:20.839 align:start position:0%
complicated like I do I even want a
 
00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
supplemental Medicare plan or or
 
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
whatever you know do I even need it you
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
know but and which one and and yeah I
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for me my employer will
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
pay for it for 5 years so we have to I
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
retire so it's not like it's a big deal
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
to me but rep of Nel and rep pal you
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
both raised some really good points part
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
of it comes down to is historically most
 
00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:47.720 align:start position:0%
patients rely upon the employer to make
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
the choice for them Y and when they get
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
into the situation whether it's the
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
individual Market or whether it's
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
through Medicare they'll lost and to
 
00:45:58.109 --> 00:45:58.119 align:start position:0%
your point they don't really understand
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
how to read the policies and understand
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
what's before them so part of it going
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
to be patient education which is
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
definitely going to be a different tack
 
00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:08.079 align:start position:0%
altogether I did Al oh go ahead did you
 
00:46:10.589 --> 00:46:10.599 align:start position:0%
have a yeah I was just going to Echo the
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
point that representative Merchant made
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
earlier which I just want to make sure
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
everybody heard um so the the rsas that
 
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
you're talking about here are um fully
 
00:46:26.109 --> 00:46:26.119 align:start position:0%
insured individual Market small group
 
00:46:28.349 --> 00:46:28.359 align:start position:0%
and large group and that's at best about
 
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
only 25% of the market in New Hampshire
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
so the remainder is Medicaid Medicare um
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
the VA um
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
uninsured uh the the self-funded um is
 
00:46:44.589 --> 00:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
actually a growing segment of the market
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
as um more and more um requirements and
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
mandates get put on the fully insured
 
00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
products um it used to be that only the
 
00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
very largest of employers you know like
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
State and municipalities and very very
 
00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
large businesses were in the the
 
00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
self-funded market and
 
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
as mandates have increased and the costs
 
00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
have gone up you see medium and even
 
00:47:15.069 --> 00:47:15.079 align:start position:0%
smaller sized businesses going into the
 
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
um the self-funded market because they
 
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
decide that at some point they decide
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
it's worth the risk to be to be there so
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to and it's actually
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
something that the insurance department
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
is um paying more and more attention to
 
00:47:33.069 --> 00:47:33.079 align:start position:0%
in terms of the um the small group
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
Market is dwindling and um it's a
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
concern because as it dwindles um you
 
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:42.680 align:start position:0%
kind of have the potential for things to
 
00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
kind of spiral you know the the
 
00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
proverbial death spiral I'm not saying
 
00:47:47.069 --> 00:47:47.079 align:start position:0%
we're there but I'm saying it's
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
something that's on their radar and so I
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
just wanted to again reiterate what this
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation what slice of the
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
market you would be hitting and and um
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
historically um whenever the house
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
Commerce has or either Commerce
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
Committee the senate or the house have
 
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
considered new mandates um they have
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
excluded the individual Market um
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
because in a post AA World um any new
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
mandates imposed by a state after so
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
you've got the the federal government
 
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
obviously um there's lots of
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities for for subsidies and that
 
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
sort of thing but if a state imposes a
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
new mandate the cost of that that um
 
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
this the federal government will not
 
00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
subsidize and it's a state obligation so
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
the state is tended to shy away from
 
00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
putting mandates new mandates onto the
 
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
individual market so mandates that we've
 
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
seen in the last you know however many
 
00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
years since the ACA it's it's been even
 
00:48:52.789 --> 00:48:52.799 align:start position:0%
more narrow and only focused on small
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
group and large group so um just things
 
00:48:58.349 --> 00:48:58.359 align:start position:0%
to consider and and I know this I think
 
00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:02.200 align:start position:0%
in part that's why um your bill house
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
bille 303 was sent to the Commerce
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
Committee because they yeah um they're
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
well-versed in all this so I really
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate everything you said this
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
whole process been extremely educ oh can
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
I talk sure you want to talk just a
 
00:49:21.309 --> 00:49:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
conversation if we change the shells to
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
May which I told
 
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
support at the end of the day how is
 
00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
that different than what we have
 
00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:34.640 align:start position:0%
today that is a really awesome question
 
00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
am I allowed to say awesome um because I
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
had the same question because the person
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
that suggested that I do that I look at
 
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
it I go what did we actually accomplish
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
here um and I'm not really sure um this
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
is but we will accomplish something and
 
00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
um and that's what a question or comment
 
00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
that I really wanted to make was so in
 
00:49:58.990 --> 00:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
full disclosure you know I I know I'm a
 
00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
legislator but I also represent
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists um not as a l well maybe
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
way I do but um I I'm on the legislative
 
00:50:11.069 --> 00:50:11.079 align:start position:0%
committee Nel yeah you're not a lobbyist
 
00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:13.720 align:start position:0%
you can advocate for yourself for your
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
profession within the legislative body
 
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
but you're definitely not a lobbyist
 
00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:19.559 align:start position:0%
that is true that is true but I've
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
worked with the American Academy medical
 
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
acupuncture for a long time um so this
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
is an issue that we've talked about for
 
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
a very long time and also the driving
 
00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:31.720 align:start position:0%
force behind this legislation is
 
00:50:34.549 --> 00:50:34.559 align:start position:0%
actually the chiropractors who feel and
 
00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
and this is my observation of 35 years
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is that they've
 
00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
gradually become crowded out more and
 
00:50:43.309 --> 00:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
more so like when I first started like I
 
00:50:46.789 --> 00:50:46.799 align:start position:0%
mean to see you know 24 visits a year
 
00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
paid for wasn't unusual now they don't
 
00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
get that and and that's really
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
frustrating for them and they're the
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
ones that are really driving this
 
00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:55.480 align:start position:0%
conversation so I think that they would
 
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
you've been at the hearings they would
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
contradict a lot of what you've said um
 
00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
so I kind of feel like that's you know
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
we're we're speaking on their behalf I'm
 
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
concerned that with the maze the shells
 
00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to accomplish what
 
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
they want to accomplish but it it
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
achieves some middle ground and maybe
 
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
that's something it it's
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
something rep of Neel I would say
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
that maybe part of the issue that
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
they're feeling crowded out comes down
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
to as people talked about before as the
 
00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:31.640 align:start position:0%
market moves more into
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
Arisa which then is determined by the
 
00:51:36.109 --> 00:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
employer not by the insurance company
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
themselves because they said if I
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly they said the
 
00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
guidelines of the plan and that they're
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
trying to find ways to reduce the cost
 
00:51:45.549 --> 00:51:45.559 align:start position:0%
that may be one of the opportunities for
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
them to reduce the cost of the plan
 
00:51:50.309 --> 00:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
number two which I don't know totally
 
00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
but assuming that more and more people
 
00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
go into Medicare Advantage versus
 
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:57.640 align:start position:0%
tradition traditional that comes under
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
the HMO model within Medicare and those
 
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
models may also start to begin to impact
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
the chiropractice themselves so it could
 
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
be a shift in the marketplace because of
 
00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
healthc care Dynamics and economics
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's causing some of the unlying
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
problem they're
 
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
facing go ahead yeah um so there's two
 
00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
things I just wanted to add thank you
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
for letting me jump in um so one thing I
 
00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
was going to say is that
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
um uh Laur employers that are
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
self-funded um I think by and large um
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
use third-party administrators tpas um
 
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
to actually administer their um their
 
00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:39.799 align:start position:0%
plans so even though the company itself
 
00:52:41.549 --> 00:52:41.559 align:start position:0%
or the municipality or the St or whoever
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
the entity is is taking the risk
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
associated with the insurance they're
 
00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
they have somebody else doing all the
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
administrative work and so my
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
understanding is that
 
00:52:57.789 --> 00:52:57.799 align:start position:0%
um while the self fun funed um entities
 
00:52:59.630 --> 00:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
are not required you know there are not
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
mandates on them like there are on the
 
00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:05.240 align:start position:0%
fully insured plans um because these
 
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
third party administrators like siga
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
like Anthem um other uh United probably
 
00:53:14.789 --> 00:53:14.799 align:start position:0%
um they they operate both as third party
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
administrators as well as in the large
 
00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:19.720 align:start position:0%
group and small group um perhaps even
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
the individual markets as well they will
 
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:26.200 align:start position:0%
often bring their um the covered
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
Services as a template to those large
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
employers so I just wanted to say that I
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
think for example chiropractic care I
 
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
think is pretty well like standardized
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
at this point in terms of being covered
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
um so that's one thing I wanted to say
 
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
the other thing I wanted to say that
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
we've heard from the chiropractors and
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
perhaps other um service providers kind
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
of that fall into the fields that you're
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
looking at here
 
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
um is
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
they and they have testified to this
 
00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
that they will often choose to stay out
 
00:54:02.829 --> 00:54:02.839 align:start position:0%
of network and not contract with
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and so I I just
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to point that out that it's
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
another reason when you're asking like
 
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
what effect will this legislation have
 
00:54:17.549 --> 00:54:17.559 align:start position:0%
um so moving from sh to May def you know
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
on the one hand I guess you could argue
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
it it's on the book still that's kind of
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
rais elevating I guess elevating the the
 
00:54:29.109 --> 00:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity um but to the extent that
 
00:54:31.789 --> 00:54:31.799 align:start position:0%
providers are staying out of network
 
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
this will not apply to them so they they
 
00:54:37.789 --> 00:54:37.799 align:start position:0%
are preferring to have um cash pay
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
patients and not not deal with um
 
00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
insurance at all so I just wanted to say
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
that when you overlay that onto this 25%
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
of the market or less um you're getting
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
to a very a smaller and smaller sliver
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
so I I'm really glad you said that
 
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
because the point that I wanted to make
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
was you know I I've talked all over the
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
country to chiropractic and massage or
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
acupuncture groups about this and the
 
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
question I've asked them in large groups
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
is why do you want to be insured or why
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
do you want insurance at all you got a
 
00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
great system right now you you know you
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
get cash you don't have to deal with
 
00:55:16.589 --> 00:55:16.599 align:start position:0%
forms you don't have to go through
 
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:18.200 align:start position:0%
insurers you don't have to do this that
 
00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:19.640 align:start position:0%
or the other thing you seem to be doing
 
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
fine and guess what you're happy CU I
 
00:55:25.029 --> 00:55:25.039 align:start position:0%
swear one of the reasons why uh provid
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
ERS um you know lose their happiness in
 
00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
providing care is all the forms the
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
prior authorizations so on and so forth
 
00:55:34.589 --> 00:55:34.599 align:start position:0%
and is you have any of that you've got a
 
00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:36.440 align:start position:0%
great life what's the matter and their
 
00:55:40.349 --> 00:55:40.359 align:start position:0%
response is that they want access to a
 
00:55:43.349 --> 00:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
greater portion of the market the people
 
00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:45.160 align:start position:0%
that can't afford their services which
 
00:55:47.789 --> 00:55:47.799 align:start position:0%
then doesn't come down to you it comes
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
down to Medicare Medicaid and things
 
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
like that which is I think why with HB
 
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
66 we want to f focus on that group and
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
and that and I and I'm I'm really glad
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
you said everything you said because it
 
00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
it brought into very perspective how
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
damage I I shouldn't say this publicly
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
but how challenging the Affordable Care
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
Act has been for your industry and for
 
00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
all of us and when we look at
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
skyrocketing Insurance costs that are
 
00:56:16.829 --> 00:56:16.839 align:start position:0%
adversely affecting pretty much
 
00:56:19.029 --> 00:56:19.039 align:start position:0%
everybody you know it's important to
 
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:21.160 align:start position:0%
hear that message on a regular basis and
 
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
that's why I was really sensitive to not
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
wanting to burden you with this
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
um does it make sense it does d Nel I I
 
00:56:35.069 --> 00:56:35.079 align:start position:0%
think this here is trying
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
to if you want to call it fix or to
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
modify what exists
 
00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:43.559 align:start position:0%
today what I think about House Bill 66
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
is trying to look at a fundamental shift
 
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
into something that's truly integrated
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
and using a pilot using a small segment
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
of the market to learn from it I think
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
it could step down to not just the
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
integration of the providers and how we
 
00:56:59.789 --> 00:56:59.799 align:start position:0%
communicate amongst the providers but
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
also the payment model that goes with it
 
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
so I I really think I'd rather put more
 
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
of our effort into house bill 66 than
 
00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:09.160 align:start position:0%
try to go down this road if we leave the
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
word may versus shall I don't think this
 
00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
is really going to change things
 
00:57:16.589 --> 00:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
significantly it's more of a window
 
00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
dressing in my
 
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
opinion so let me ask you a question to
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
follow up at this point that pretty much
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
guts the entire bill so are you
 
00:57:29.549 --> 00:57:29.559 align:start position:0%
advocating that we just itl it I would
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
say after this l ly lengthy conversation
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
and your knowledge and your wisdom yes I
 
00:57:37.789 --> 00:57:37.799 align:start position:0%
would say the recommendation should be
 
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
it no I I I I I I don't I think that was
 
00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:50.710 align:start position:0%
it no I I I I I I don't I think that was
extremely

00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
helpful I was hoping that you two would
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
come and talk
 
00:57:59.230 --> 00:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
you're always helpful and thoughtful I I
 
00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
felt the same way because when that made
 
00:58:04.829 --> 00:58:04.839 align:start position:0%
a sh thing is like well why bother you
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
know what's the whole point
 
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
um I was going to say something Beyond
 
00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
intelligent I forgot what it was the
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
world have probably ceased to exist now
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
because I didn't remember what I was
 
00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:25.720 align:start position:0%
say um May I so one question
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
I have is obviously if if we could
 
00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
figure out that a bill like this was
 
00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
going to reduce costs overall um and and
 
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
the the I mean the media problem is if
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
we you know keep one person from
 
00:58:46.349 --> 00:58:46.359 align:start position:0%
becoming opiate
 
00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
dependent that I mean there's a dollar
 
00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:51.880 align:start position:0%
cost to that but but also there's a big
 
00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
human cost which you can't maybe measure
 
00:58:57.150 --> 00:58:57.160 align:start position:0%
in dollar but um I'm just wondering down
 
00:58:58.829 --> 00:58:58.839 align:start position:0%
the road whether
 
00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
we you know like there there's all of
 
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
the the the studies about which care is
 
00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:07.839 align:start position:0%
the best care for a given situation and
 
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
increasingly we're um looking towards a
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
more behavioral approach or even
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
preventative approaches to this
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
obviously once you have an injury and
 
00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
you have pain now we got to figure it
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
out but even there like you were talking
 
00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
about back pain is that physical therapy
 
00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
and and um and Chiropractic are often
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
the the best route for sort of
 
00:59:33.029 --> 00:59:33.039 align:start position:0%
traditional low back pain as opposed to
 
00:59:35.549 --> 00:59:35.559 align:start position:0%
some more you know doing x-rays and
 
00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
using medications and or you know more
 
00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:41.720 align:start position:0%
than Tylenol or or uprof or something so
 
00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
whether it one way to look at this is
 
00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:49.240 align:start position:0%
how to how to come if we're not going to
 
00:59:51.029 --> 00:59:51.039 align:start position:0%
go with this how to come back with
 
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:00.029 --> 01:00:00.039 align:start position:0%
how you how you sort of force people
 
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
more into doing what is the actual high
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
value medicine and away from low value
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
care um and maybe you C and particularly
 
01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at a small percentage
 
01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
of the the people less than 25% um how
 
01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
how do we how might we approach this to
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
get more of this care that is probably
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
cheaper long term to to the people who
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
need it the most so if I can answer that
 
01:00:34.109 --> 01:00:34.119 align:start position:0%
question you basically the whole premise
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
of my book is based on what you just
 
01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
asked um and I will ask the insurers
 
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
this because I've asked you this at
 
01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
every meeting we've ever
 
01:00:47.309 --> 01:00:47.319 align:start position:0%
had um Everybody Wants evidence-based
 
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
care I have no clue what that even means
 
01:00:52.829 --> 01:00:52.839 align:start position:0%
I wrote a whole thing on facts and
 
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
fallacies of evidence-based medic Medic
 
01:00:56.349 --> 01:00:56.359 align:start position:0%
in in the in the book and it was
 
01:00:58.190 --> 01:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
actually a standalone chapter at one
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
point because it was really important to
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
me you know evidence base is based on
 
01:01:06.309 --> 01:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
whoever is providing the evidence and
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
like like for example like like in
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
Interventional pain management we've
 
01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:13.720 align:start position:0%
been doing it now for 35 years we have
 
01:01:15.789 --> 01:01:15.799 align:start position:0%
like no evidence that anything that we
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
do Works anything more than a short
 
01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
period at time and and many of the
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
interventions are extremely costly
 
01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:25.480 align:start position:0%
extremely invasive I'm seeing like
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
patients coming in now who've had back
 
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
pain for three months that they want to
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
ablate them at an extreme cost when we
 
01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
know the procedure doesn't work and then
 
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
spine surgery for non-h herniated disc
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
without ridicul opathy outcomes are
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
terrible in short and long I mean
 
01:01:44.829 --> 01:01:44.839 align:start position:0%
shortterm and long term and nobody looks
 
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
at long-term outcomes and to be honest
 
01:01:49.029 --> 01:01:49.039 align:start position:0%
the only measure that matters to me is
 
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
long-term outcome we know facet
 
01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:53.319 align:start position:0%
injections don't work we've known that
 
01:01:55.069 --> 01:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
for 30 years
 
01:01:57.269 --> 01:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
but we pay for those things and and I
 
01:01:59.870 --> 01:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
presented at one of our meetings like
 
01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
how many acupuncture appointments I can
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
have with a patient for the cost of one
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
epidural injection and I and I sit there
 
01:02:09.269 --> 01:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
and I go I could treat a person for a
 
01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:12.200 align:start position:0%
whole year with acupuncture for the cost
 
01:02:14.829 --> 01:02:14.839 align:start position:0%
of one injection and I there's okay
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
evidence on acupuncture it's at least as
 
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
good if not better than um the evidence
 
01:02:22.829 --> 01:02:22.839 align:start position:0%
for neuro and and epidural injection and
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that so then the next
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
question I come down to is well why do
 
01:02:28.589 --> 01:02:28.599 align:start position:0%
we pay for neuro oblation but we don't
 
01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
pay for acupuncture and I don't get that
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
and I do get it I do totally understand
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
it it's in my book read my book but
 
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
anyway I'm selling my book here on I
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
guess so now that's a disclosure but I I
 
01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
I don't make any money off of it but I'm
 
01:02:45.789 --> 01:02:45.799 align:start position:0%
just saying it's a good book Dr thanks
 
01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:49.160 align:start position:0%
but I I just trying to figure out like
 
01:02:52.109 --> 01:02:52.119 align:start position:0%
it and I know the answer but it's to me
 
01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
if to answer your question
 
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
representative is that we need to change
 
01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
a system and I don't think this bill is
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
going to make that change I I don't
 
01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:01.039 align:start position:0%
think it will either I think
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
philosophically we just kind of where
 
01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
we're drifting
 
01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:07.670 align:start position:0%
we're drifting
to

01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.269 --> 01:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
um people have asked me about Medicare
 
01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
for all and would that solve the problem
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
and I said well they solve the access
 
01:03:16.829 --> 01:03:16.839 align:start position:0%
problem to some degree but it's not
 
01:03:19.069 --> 01:03:19.079 align:start position:0%
going to solve the finance problem we're
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
a consumer-driven society and when you
 
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
allow consumers to consume
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
they will consume at the same time we
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
have providers and people in healthcare
 
01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
that are all predicated upon making the
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
living off that consumption so until you
 
01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
figure out how to change those Dynamics
 
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
which I don't know how to do
 
01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.710 align:start position:0%
which I don't know how to do
today

01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
so I mean it's it's really simple you
 
01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
get R rid of fee for service
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
medicine I mean but it's simple but it's
 
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
simple in concept I don't representative
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
Palmer um I remember in House Bill 66
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
one of the um last presentation we had
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
and they talked about first line second
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
line and third line first line is all
 
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
the things we talked about it's massage
 
01:04:11.309 --> 01:04:11.319 align:start position:0%
it's um ta Chi it's it's helping the
 
01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
patient at the very beginning of their
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
Journey Down with pain particular
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
chronic pain however almost everything
 
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
in Silo One is paid out of pocket by the
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
patient so they don't have any resources
 
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of times to access things in Sil
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
Silo one so they go to Silo 2 which gets
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
into the provider part of it and then if
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
that doesn't work then you go Silo 3
 
01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
which is what Dr Nel's talking about
 
01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
Neel is the surgical part and so forth
 
01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
Etc but we don't do a lot to help the
 
01:04:45.269 --> 01:04:45.279 align:start position:0%
patient in the first
 
01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
Silo what I would love to see is that
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know if we're going to seriously
 
01:04:53.309 --> 01:04:53.319 align:start position:0%
talk about evidence base that we need to
 
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
be really open and honest and and submit
 
01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
everybody to the same Level Playing
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
Field about evidence that you know if
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
you're a spine surgeon and you're going
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
to work B pedicle screws on a
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
degenerative spine your level of
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
evidence has to be the same as an
 
01:05:11.069 --> 01:05:11.079 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist you know their level of
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
evidence if you're going to supply apply
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
different levels of evidence then that's
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
not fair and it's not right and um my
 
01:05:20.029 --> 01:05:20.039 align:start position:0%
belief personally has been for a very
 
01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
long period of time that
 
01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
um that the money that we spend on those
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
things if you shifted that money to
 
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
these other things and Bill you talked
 
01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:31.269 align:start position:0%
these other things and Bill you talked
about

01:05:31.269 --> 01:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:05:33.309 --> 01:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
prevention like the national pain
 
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
strategy prevention was one of the six
 
01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
pillars and when we're talking about
 
01:05:40.349 --> 01:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
like um the opioid abatement commission
 
01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
and the governor's Commission on alcohol
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
prevention is a big pillar so we looked
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
at where the gaps were there's like
 
01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
nothing in prevention it's like well
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
that's crazy I mean if you start hitting
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
things like early on cost effective and
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
I'm going to share one story so I was
 
01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
out to dinner with u my my my uh friends
 
01:06:04.589 --> 01:06:04.599 align:start position:0%
and my friend's mom was with him and and
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
and and his wife threw her back out at
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
the dinner table and I'm sitting here
 
01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
this world renowned expert on back ha
 
01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:13.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm sitting how am I going to take
 
01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
care of this my friend's mother said
 
01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
here just do this and she did in her
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
back pain was fine that was free I mean
 
01:06:23.309 --> 01:06:23.319 align:start position:0%
that was amazing but I realize how
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
stupid I
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
thought I had in my mind was something
 
01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:29.079 align:start position:0%
complicated whereas all she needed was
 
01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
something was that evidence based
 
01:06:33.069 --> 01:06:33.079 align:start position:0%
totally cuz I was watching it it was
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
like but I I'm I'm always struck by how
 
01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
many times we apply complex solutions to
 
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
simple problems that cost it I mean
 
01:06:45.309 --> 01:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
every day I see patients $10,000 spended
 
01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
for a problem that could have been fixed
 
01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
for for like an ibuprofen prescription
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
it's crazy have go back to what
 
01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
represent Palmer said
 
01:06:58.750 --> 01:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
it goes back to FIFA service um I I
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
don't disagree at all I think that's one
 
01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
of the concerns we all have
 
01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
is how do you incentivize somebody to do
 
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
things without getting into being
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
compensative for every single which it
 
01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:13.309 align:start position:0%
compensative for every single which it
you

01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
do well I mean because it's a double the
 
01:07:18.269 --> 01:07:18.279 align:start position:0%
other side of fee for service is that
 
01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:19.799 align:start position:0%
there are some things that are that we
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
pay a lot for mostly procedures and
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
other things we pay very little for so
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
they don't happen I mean the best
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
example I'm thinking is just talking to
 
01:07:33.390 --> 01:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
a gast gastrologist a few years ago and
 
01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
you know I I just wanted a consult on a
 
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
patient I didn't want to proceed her and
 
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
he said well I'll I'll do a curbside but
 
01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
I don't you know it's not worth it to me
 
01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
to do the consult and you just go like
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
that's you know he should he I mean it
 
01:07:50.589 --> 01:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
does I mean not that you want the person
 
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
who's doing the colonoscopy to be really
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
good at it but I thought the reason that
 
01:07:56.829 --> 01:07:56.839 align:start position:0%
they got the extra training was so that
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
they could think about the GI problem
 
01:08:02.269 --> 01:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
and they should get paid the same for
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
you know within you know within reason
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
and and that's that's a huge part of and
 
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
that actually that's I mean that's a
 
01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
national problem that's got to get fixed
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
at a whole different level
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
but but that's also I think why I'm so
 
01:08:19.149 --> 01:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
looking forward to House Bill 66 and
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
talking about trying to create something
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
that's fundamentally different um and
 
01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
pilot program and try to understand how
 
01:08:29.789 --> 01:08:29.799 align:start position:0%
we can get again a small scale work on
 
01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
it and find out at that point in time
 
01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
are the things we're advocating for in
 
01:08:37.709 --> 01:08:37.719 align:start position:0%
fact do they either reduce cost or do
 
01:08:40.829 --> 01:08:40.839 align:start position:0%
the same cost Factor but actually get
 
01:08:42.749 --> 01:08:42.759 align:start position:0%
better outcomes and I think that's what
 
01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:44.759 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do on a small scale
 
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
without trying to change the whole
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
system but look at a small piece of
 
01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
it and that's back to the same thing you
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
talking about represent Palmer it's the
 
01:08:57.789 --> 01:08:57.799 align:start position:0%
fundamental Al issue of compensation and
 
01:08:59.789 --> 01:08:59.799 align:start position:0%
it's not just looking at and saying who
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
is driving the compensation because like
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
in hospice I think you're probably aware
 
01:09:06.030 --> 01:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
of you get a bundle payment but the
 
01:09:08.669 --> 01:09:08.679 align:start position:0%
hospice organization is the one that's
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
determining how to utilize those
 
01:09:12.749 --> 01:09:12.759 align:start position:0%
resources not have something
 
01:09:15.149 --> 01:09:15.159 align:start position:0%
micromanaged you know this is really a
 
01:09:17.789 --> 01:09:17.799 align:start position:0%
scary conversation to me because I think
 
01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
what we're doing has a lot of value and
 
01:09:22.269 --> 01:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
this discussion has a lot of
 
01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
value but unless you convince people to
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
do the things that we want them to do or
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
trying to encourage them to do unless we
 
01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
give them a financial incentive to do it
 
01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
they won't do it and Mur said something
 
01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:36.199 align:start position:0%
earlier that bothered me a lot but I
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
know it's true is that if you're in a
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
small hospital and you you lose your hip
 
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
replacement dock all of a sudden your
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
hospital goes belly up and I sit there
 
01:09:47.470 --> 01:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
and I go that's really sad that you put
 
01:09:49.870 --> 01:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
so many eggs in one basket that you're
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
going to put the risk of the entire
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
Health Care Network in your community at
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
risk just because one guy can't do one
 
01:09:59.630 --> 01:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
procedure you know I I I I don't know
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
these are you're right these are
 
01:10:03.149 --> 01:10:03.159 align:start position:0%
problems I don't think 303 was going to
 
01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
solve any of that but I and I these are
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
Big questions and I'm really glad we had
 
01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
this discussion I'll make a motion on
 
01:10:12.669 --> 01:10:12.679 align:start position:0%
the floor to recommend
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
itl you thanks since it came from you I
 
01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.430 align:start position:0%
itl you thanks since it came from you I
feel

01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
feel
 
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
better I I really don't want to be the
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
one to do that thank you I'll put
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant with a Target on
 
01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:26.870 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant with a Target on
his

01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
his
 
01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
back I can second so when it whatever
 
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
rebounds off him hits me yeah thanks so
 
01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
the motion on the floor is itl by
 
01:10:36.669 --> 01:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
represent Merchants second to by
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
represent plumber yep and the vote is
 
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
going to be three Z or two why we do a
 
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
two to one two to one that's F yeah I
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
don't mind I I I was a 19 to one on one
 
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
vote I was still proud of
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
that I know I was right you guys are all
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
wrong yeah motion to adjourn motion is
 
01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:22.550 align:start position:0%
wrong yeah motion to adjourn motion is
accepted

01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
