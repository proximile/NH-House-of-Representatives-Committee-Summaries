00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 align:start position:0%
so what I like to do today is we we have
 
00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 align:start position:0%
a lot of ground to cover
 
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 align:start position:0%
um so I did put an agenda out on the
 
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
table for those folks that don't have
 
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.350 align:start position:0%
table for those folks that don't have
one

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
um my my hope is to be as alexandrian as
 
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
possible and kind of cut through
 
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
um the bulk of this agenda uh pretty
 
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.050 align:start position:0%
um the bulk of this agenda uh pretty
quickly

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
um representative Gordon is going to be
 
00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 align:start position:0%
looking to maybe get us together in
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
October to kind of look for the final
 
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
disposition so if we can it'd be nice if
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
we could kind of get through everything
 
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.570 align:start position:0%
we could kind of get through everything
today

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
um so I'll start with a recap of the
 
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
last meeting that we had basically we
 
00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 align:start position:0%
had a lot of discussion about what what
 
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 align:start position:0%
is is the caseload at the Human Rights
 
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
Commission and I think that we had come
 
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
to a place where we were saying right
 
00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
now as we're staffed uh with five
 
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
investigators cases in uh is equal to
 
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
cases out so we're in a place uh where
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
the commission is operating in a steady
 
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
state but obviously the question remains
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
that there's a big backlog and and
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
what's to be done about that
 
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
um next we got into a discussion uh
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
about uh the requirements of SB 296 and
 
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
are the existing resources of the
 
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.710 align:start position:0%
are the existing resources of the
commission

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
um adequate to satisfy those
 
00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
requirements and I think after some good
 
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
discussion uh we were pretty much in a
 
00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419 align:start position:0%
place where we said yes indeed the
 
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
resources there given uh the the rate of
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
removal are adequate we talked uh about
 
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
the potential for the immediate removal
 
00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:14.819 align:start position:0%
to Superior to court if represented by
 
00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:16.979 align:start position:0%
Council the question was initially asked
 
00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:18.419 align:start position:0%
what if we just did it across the board
 
00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
the thinking was maybe just if there's
 
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
representation by Council
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
um we talked um about uh our
 
00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:29.699 align:start position:0%
recommendation memorandum that had come
 
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
from the association of justice and
 
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
there was a timeline that went through
 
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:34.790 align:start position:0%
there was a timeline that went through
that

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
and basically
 
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.850 align:start position:0%
and basically
um

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:37.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
the the folks over at the Human Rights
 
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
Commission were saying the probable
 
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
cause standard standard sorry that is
 
00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:48.419 align:start position:0%
being uh discussed here is something uh
 
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
that we are already kind of doing so the
 
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
the question that arose out of that was
 
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
just uh could we kind of get some
 
00:08:00.529 --> 00:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
completion data uh before and after you
 
00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:02.819 align:start position:0%
know the break-in date when when did we
 
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
modify the standard in its application
 
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
at the commission and did we see uh any
 
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
shift uh with respect to investigation
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
time uh before and after because that
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
would give us a feel really
 
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
um if doing that is going to do anything
 
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:22.860 align:start position:0%
to kind of impact the timeline we also
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
talked about options for limiting the
 
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
potential to amend claims and then we
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
kind of finished the day off uh with a
 
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:33.140 align:start position:0%
penalty discussion there were some
 
00:08:35.209 --> 00:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
recommendations that we could possibly
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
look at penalties in the memorandum so
 
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
there was some concern would that be uh
 
00:08:44.209 --> 00:08:44.219 align:start position:0%
penalties on an individual basis what
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
would that look like
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
um so uh basically we said okay we'll do
 
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
some digging and we'll park that for the
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
next meeting which is today
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of just a recap of where
 
00:08:58.610 --> 00:08:58.620 align:start position:0%
we were in the last meeting yes
 
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.930 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
uh

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:08.329 --> 00:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
I'm in awe of all the work that you've
 
00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:09.350 align:start position:0%
I'm in awe of all the work that you've
done

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:09:13.009 --> 00:09:13.019 align:start position:0%
and I think it's incredible but I have a
 
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
couple of different reactions then and I
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
might be wrong so please correct me for
 
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
example I think we concluded that cases
 
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:26.180 align:start position:0%
in and cases equal cases out
 
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
was not applicable since we were told
 
00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:33.740 align:start position:0%
that you could they took in 20 to 30
 
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
cases a month and that they
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
um have roughly on average four hearings
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
a year that's number one and related to
 
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.889 align:start position:0%
a year that's number one and related to
that

00:09:47.889 --> 00:09:47.899 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
was uh in terms of the Staffing when we
 
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
were told that the load was cut from 50
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
to 25 for each investigator
 
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
and we were curious about what happened
 
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
to the remaining 25 we were told well
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
they just weren't given to the
 
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
investigator so I don't think that
 
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
indicates that the Staffing is adequate
 
00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:16.700 align:start position:0%
um and so on particularly on those two
 
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.290 align:start position:0%
um and so on particularly on those two
areas

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.009 align:start position:0%
areas
um

00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:19.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
I didn't see agreement and then the
 
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
third is the one we've kind of skirted
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
around several times and that is the
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
difference in
 
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
the length of time for any
 
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.389 align:start position:0%
the length of time for any
um

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:36.779 align:start position:0%
any case as compared with what is
 
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
required by Statute and rules and so
 
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.550 align:start position:0%
required by Statute and rules and so
um

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
I think yours your summary is really
 
00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839 align:start position:0%
optimistic and I would like it to be
 
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
absolutely accurate but I'm not a
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
hundred percent sure that it is well
 
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah thank you and and you are
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
correct the the Active cases at the
 
00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:01.009 align:start position:0%
correct the the Active cases at the
commission

00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:01.019 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:06.200 align:start position:0%
um is about 20 to 25 per investigator
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
and so the surplus of cases that of of
 
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
the 50 that basically is what went into
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
the backlog
 
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.790 align:start position:0%
the backlog
so

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
um but it was my understanding and the
 
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
director can correct me if I'm wrong
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
with my understanding based on the
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
testimony that
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
the accumulation
 
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
um was was no longer accumulating that
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
the accumulation went back to when they
 
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
had uh the the the two member staff but
 
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:42.660 align:start position:0%
now it's about 200 plus cases in 200
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
plus cases out but the accumulation that
 
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
had accumulated over the course of a
 
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
decade really there there's no impact
 
00:11:55.009 --> 00:11:55.019 align:start position:0%
being made on that so basically a case
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
comes in we're picking it up in the
 
00:11:59.690 --> 00:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
order that it was docketed but
 
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
everything else just has to go for a
 
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
long time because there is nothing
 
00:12:06.889 --> 00:12:06.899 align:start position:0%
that's really being done to address the
 
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
accumulation which is why I think I
 
00:12:11.449 --> 00:12:11.459 align:start position:0%
think we're in a steady state but
 
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
nothing is being done to address the
 
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
accumulation that's where I think the
 
00:12:17.329 --> 00:12:17.339 align:start position:0%
significant backlog does remain which is
 
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
why I think it would be interesting to
 
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
look to see
 
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
um since we have modified the probable
 
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
cause standard at the commission
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
um what are we seeing with respect to
 
00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
the investigation time and what are we
 
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
seeing with respect to the accumulation
 
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
um which is you know that that's I think
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
what what do you mean that we've
 
00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:46.519 align:start position:0%
modified the probable cause we haven't
 
00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:51.779 align:start position:0%
no no in the testimony last week the
 
00:12:54.889 --> 00:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
memorandum that was presented
 
00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:55.610 align:start position:0%
memorandum that was presented
um

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:56.990 align:start position:0%
um
was

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
stating there were recommendations in
 
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
the memorandum that said we need to
 
00:13:07.009 --> 00:13:07.019 align:start position:0%
modify the the the probable cause
 
00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
standard to be less of a finding of fact
 
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
right which was what it had been in the
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
past so the director testified that
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
currently they had modified that
 
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:35.090 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:38.449 --> 00:13:38.459 align:start position:0%
do you see could you go here sir because
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
I'm people are going to want to hear
 
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
what you have to say
 
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:48.769 --> 00:13:48.779 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
um okay so our internal case processing
 
00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:56.579 align:start position:0%
process was modified the probable cause
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
standard is still the same but how we
 
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
internally process our cases has been
 
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.190 align:start position:0%
internally process our cases has been
changed

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
so yeah so my understanding was yeah
 
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
because that the probable cause standard
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
is statutory but it was was my
 
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.129 align:start position:0%
is statutory but it was was my
understanding

00:14:13.129 --> 00:14:13.139 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:14:13.139 --> 00:14:15.170 align:start position:0%
understanding
that

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:15.180 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
and maybe I misunderstood this from last
 
00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:20.579 align:start position:0%
week's testimony that you had been
 
00:14:23.449 --> 00:14:23.459 align:start position:0%
applying a very aggressive almost kind
 
00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
of super standard and that you had kind
 
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
of dialed that back a little bit to be
 
00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
more in line with the statute I
 
00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
understand okay all right and so so yeah
 
00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519 align:start position:0%
so I I yes so the statutory language of
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
the standard
 
00:14:44.329 --> 00:14:44.339 align:start position:0%
has not changed but how you are
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
approaching that statutory standard
 
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
was changed to be more in line with the
 
00:14:53.449 --> 00:14:53.459 align:start position:0%
memo that was presented last week and so
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
you said we're already actually doing
 
00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
that and because we're doing that our
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
we the the one-year timeline which was a
 
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
timeline that was presented is a
 
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
timeline that we are meeting was what I
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
took away from the the discussions that
 
00:15:11.449 --> 00:15:11.459 align:start position:0%
we had last week is that correct or
 
00:15:14.449 --> 00:15:14.459 align:start position:0%
incorrect I I understand okay
 
00:15:14.459 --> 00:15:15.410 align:start position:0%
incorrect I I understand okay
um

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
so the memo that was given last week was
 
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
is separate from what we're doing
 
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
correct that was recommendations on
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
process okay yes and what had been done
 
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
at the commission was there are
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:35.629 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:37.129 align:start position:0%
um
different

00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:38.030 align:start position:0%
different
um

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
not barriers but different standards
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
that the complainant must meet at every
 
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:44.990 align:start position:0%
that the complainant must meet at every
step

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
step
 
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
and what was previously happening was a
 
00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:50.459 align:start position:0%
very high standard in terms of report
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
writing and investigation was being done
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
prior to when it should have been
 
00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:57.769 align:start position:0%
prior to when it should have been
applied

00:15:57.769 --> 00:15:57.779 align:start position:0%
applied
 
00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
so in looking at that and looking at how
 
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
we can move the process along more
 
00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.650 align:start position:0%
we can move the process along more
efficiently

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:05.660 align:start position:0%
efficiently
 
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
not faster in terms of negating Rights
 
00:16:11.689 --> 00:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
or any anything like that but moving
 
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:13.740 align:start position:0%
ourselves efficiently and paying
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
attention to each standard that's
 
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
supposed to be met at each step
 
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
we are in line with how we are supposed
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
to be recognizing those standards at
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
each step
 
00:16:32.329 --> 00:16:32.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:34.129 --> 00:16:34.139 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the clarification yes
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.610 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
um

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:40.259 align:start position:0%
you said that specific uh requirements
 
00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:42.779 align:start position:0%
for the complainant
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
not for the agency
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
the complainant brings the charge
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
and they have to meet Prima fascia
 
00:16:53.449 --> 00:16:53.459 align:start position:0%
which is that initial at first glance
 
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be here I'm being
 
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
docked wages and it has nothing to do
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
with discrimination it doesn't go to the
 
00:17:02.569 --> 00:17:02.579 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission that would be
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
the basic triage the introductory triage
 
00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:08.339 align:start position:0%
right you can call it that sure I mean
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the legal standard so
 
00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
it has to meet that legal standard right
 
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
once it comes in the door and it is
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
being investigated then there's a back
 
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
and forth so the complainant has made
 
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
the charge
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
the respondent responds as to whatever
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
they whatever the complainant is saying
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
that they don't agree with it because
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
they did whatever that action was and it
 
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
was a non-discriminatory reason why they
 
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
did those things so they have an
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to respond and then the
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
complainant has an opportunity to say
 
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
well no you that wasn't really what
 
00:17:42.049 --> 00:17:42.059 align:start position:0%
happened it really happened this way
 
00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
and so there's a back and forth until
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
someone fails the test and at that point
 
00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
in the investigation the investigators
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
looking at all of the facts all of the
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
evidence that they have they've done
 
00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:55.740 align:start position:0%
interviews with Witnesses they've taken
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
written testimony they've looked at
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
files and all of those things and then
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
at a certain point a determination of
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
probable cause or no probable cause is
 
00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:07.580 align:start position:0%
made and then the case moves forward
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
from that point depending on which door
 
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
that charge is going into and and how
 
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:17.700 align:start position:0%
long does it take then to get from when
 
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
the case comes in until probable cause
 
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
when the case come the better question
 
00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
actually let me help you with that one
 
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
the better question is from the time
 
00:18:30.169 --> 00:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
that it's docketed to the time that it's
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
assigned I think so for me part of this
 
00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
process has been there's been a lot of
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
confusion as to the length of time the
 
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
entire process takes that the issue is
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
not once it's assigned to probable cause
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
the issue is once it's docketed to
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
assignment that is what sits in pending
 
00:18:51.409 --> 00:18:51.419 align:start position:0%
and that is what Waits and that is what
 
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
has been building once it's assigned
 
00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
then it moves through pretty pretty
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
reasonably it depends on the case
 
00:19:00.169 --> 00:19:00.179 align:start position:0%
it depends on what it is but it moves
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
through relatively quickly and then the
 
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
other metric although I know SB 296 is
 
00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:07.820 align:start position:0%
specifically speaking about hearings
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
having a hearing or not having a hearing
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
is not really the relevant question what
 
00:19:15.049 --> 00:19:15.059 align:start position:0%
part of what we do hearings are part of
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
our process but the majority of our
 
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
cases settle so the settlement is the
 
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
person is the individual being made
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
whole at some point some sort of way
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
well that's you know I I said probable
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
cause I didn't say hearing for that
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
reason oh I'm sorry may I follow up is
 
00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:36.299 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you um but for someone
 
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
who believes that they have been
 
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
aggrieved and believed that the
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate place for them to go or the
 
00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:44.900 align:start position:0%
only place they're legally allowed to go
 
00:19:48.169 --> 00:19:48.179 align:start position:0%
is is to your agency
 
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
the critical time is from the moment
 
00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
that they submit the complaint
 
00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
until there's probable cause and things
 
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
can move on it is not
 
00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
the period from when they complain until
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
it's assigned is your issue it's not the
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
complainance issue I mean and and so
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
if meanwhile they're in a difficult
 
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
situation that time counts do you have a
 
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
problem if I could just the last thing
 
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
and then I won't monopolize I problem do
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
you have to find patterns in when you
 
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
get you know you say you average 20 25
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
something like that a month have there
 
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
been any UPS or Downs over the course of
 
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
a year or two for example have you been
 
00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:38.930 align:start position:0%
a year or two for example have you been
getting

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:39.590 align:start position:0%
getting
um

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.289 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:20:41.289 --> 00:20:41.299 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
complaints related to the issue of
 
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to unpack there
 
00:20:54.049 --> 00:20:54.059 align:start position:0%
I always make it complicated on purpose
 
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
you know sorry
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
um I I guess the question would be so I
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
would like to respectfully push back on
 
00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
the timing
 
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
the the whole timing would be an issue
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
and it's specifically an issue for us
 
00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:12.900 align:start position:0%
for sure that someone is having to wait
 
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
so the important time I personally feel
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
as the executive director that's really
 
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
relevant to us moving things along
 
00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
quickly for people is the time that a
 
00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
charge will wait from the from the
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
moment it's docketed to the time that
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
it's assigned because once it's assigned
 
00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
it moves along pretty quickly I mean
 
00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
obviously there's back and forth
 
00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
sometimes people ask for people ask for
 
00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
extensions whether it's attorneys
 
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
whether it's individuals that are not
 
00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
represented that are asking for
 
00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:42.780 align:start position:0%
extensions and we try to be very
 
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
cognizant of allowing people to have
 
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.789 align:start position:0%
cognizant of allowing people to have
extensions

00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
extensions
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
um in taking with the process especially
 
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
people who are not represented but
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
having to sit and wait where nothing is
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
effectively being done because there's
 
00:21:59.690 --> 00:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
not enough staff to just continue to
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
move through that whether it's
 
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
requesting additional information
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
reminding people about mediation and a
 
00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
variety of things to either settle those
 
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
cases or or be able to continue to get
 
00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:14.039 align:start position:0%
information in that is a problem and
 
00:22:15.529 --> 00:22:15.539 align:start position:0%
that is a problem for the complainant
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
because there's nothing that's being
 
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
done specifically because there's not
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
enough staff to do it so I think it is
 
00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:23.940 align:start position:0%
very important to include that into the
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
conversation and to make sure it's clear
 
00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
that it's not just point A to point Z
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's a lot of the steps in between
 
00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
that are equally as important and
 
00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
in terms of the information the cases
 
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
that we get in we have a variety of
 
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
cases that come in every month and yes
 
00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
there are Ebbs and flows in terms of how
 
00:22:48.169 --> 00:22:48.179 align:start position:0%
many cases are docketed each month but
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
that doesn't but that's not really
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
relevant to the number of cases that are
 
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
assigned each month uh specifically
 
00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.430 align:start position:0%
assigned each month uh specifically
because

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
we have cases that are pending so it is
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
very easy to make sure that people have
 
00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
a caseload of 2025 or it could be a
 
00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:06.059 align:start position:0%
little more if someone leaves then that
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
individual who might have 25 cases will
 
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
get more cases because someone else has
 
00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:15.590 align:start position:0%
get more cases because someone else has
left

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:23.330 align:start position:0%
 
difficult

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.649 align:start position:0%
 
one

00:23:24.649 --> 00:23:24.659 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:23:27.409 --> 00:23:27.419 align:start position:0%
one docketed charge so
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
I I actually think that the time from
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
when it's assigned until the probable
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
cause that actually is an important
 
00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
time and understanding that because a
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
lot of the reform work that you're
 
00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:45.980 align:start position:0%
talking about is happening in that area
 
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
and so when you when it comes to the
 
00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:50.780 align:start position:0%
issue of the backlog
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
you can address the backlog in just a
 
00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
couple of ways either a you have to put
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
in resources you know additional
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
resources so that you can address the
 
00:24:06.529 --> 00:24:06.539 align:start position:0%
cases to kind of work the backlog down
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
or if you don't have those resources
 
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
available and you don't at this time we
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
talked about that in a little bit in the
 
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
last meeting you you have to look at
 
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
that process from the assignment until
 
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
when you're done because when that
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
happens that's going to shorten the
 
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
investigation time it's going to free up
 
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
people to allow them I think to get to
 
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
the backlog with the resources that you
 
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
have and so that's why I think
 
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
um that that is an actual important uh
 
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
bit of data to look at so one of the
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
things that we did talk about was with
 
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:41.940 align:start position:0%
some of the the changes that you made
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
and I misspoke about the the probable
 
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
cause but with respect to your your
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
process uh and and and you're
 
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:52.980 align:start position:0%
documenting and all that stuff so with
 
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
respect to that you had made some
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
changes you said
 
00:25:00.169 --> 00:25:00.179 align:start position:0%
and since you have made those changes
 
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we want to kind
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
of understand is had that had a
 
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
measurable impact
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
on the the time the actual meat of the
 
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
processing from when it's assigned until
 
00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.649 align:start position:0%
processing from when it's assigned until
when

00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:15.659 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:25:18.529 --> 00:25:18.539 align:start position:0%
um you get a finding a probable cause so
 
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
I wanted to talk about is we had any
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
data on that we able to find anything
 
00:25:24.529 --> 00:25:24.539 align:start position:0%
with that regard um I think I do have an
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
answer to that so with respect to that
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
specific question we began our new
 
00:25:30.649 --> 00:25:30.659 align:start position:0%
procedures in February of this year okay
 
00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
and we have increased the number of
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.850 align:start position:0%
 
however

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
to look at that equation
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
as we're continuing to move forward with
 
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:46.740 align:start position:0%
the new process and you're going and
 
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
we're going to close more yeah
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
there's still more coming in so it's not
 
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
a finite number so that's where the the
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
issue comes in in terms of resources I
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know and and I understand one of the
 
00:25:59.930 --> 00:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
things that we talked about last week
 
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
was okay we're at steady state so we
 
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
pretty much have the amount of cases
 
00:26:06.529 --> 00:26:06.539 align:start position:0%
coming in equals the amount of cases
 
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
going out was well kind of what I walked
 
00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:10.460 align:start position:0%
away with last week
 
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
so are you finding So when you say 50
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
additional cases because what was the
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
backlog it was something like 300 cases
 
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
uh it's not quite that much but close I
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
mean it might be like 250. okay so 250
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
cases so the 50 cases that you so you're
 
00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
able to process an additional 50 cases
 
00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
is that since February
 
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
over the course of this
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:26:42.409 --> 00:26:42.419 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you because for me this
 
00:26:45.769 --> 00:26:45.779 align:start position:0%
is a very key question
 
00:26:45.779 --> 00:26:47.470 align:start position:0%
is a very key question
you

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
saying what I'm hearing is that the
 
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
processes you implemented in February
 
00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
have increased your closure rate
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
which implies to me
 
00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
that you're actually starting to reduce
 
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
your backlog is that accurate
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
I mean it's a yes and no so yes with the
 
00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
number but if cases continue to come in
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
then you're not necessarily reaching all
 
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
of those do you understand I mean you'll
 
00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
get some for sure but if if you only
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
have if you have 200 cases and there's
 
00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:24.900 align:start position:0%
nothing else coming in and then every I
 
00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
don't know six months you close an
 
00:27:30.409 --> 00:27:30.419 align:start position:0%
additional 25 cases definitely it's done
 
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
right if each person is closing another
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
well if each person we have five staff
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
members each person closes 10 above what
 
00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
they were assigned then that's going to
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
be 50 cases so you're hitting the
 
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
backlog because nothing else is coming
 
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
in and it goes away
 
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
but when you have more hands that are
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
lifting the same or more then it
 
00:27:57.169 --> 00:27:57.179 align:start position:0%
eradicates it so
 
00:27:59.330 --> 00:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't understand what's not
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
understood yeah so yeah I would
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate a yes or a no
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
with the new procedures with the
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
increased closure rate
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
is the absolute number of backlogged
 
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.690 align:start position:0%
is the absolute number of backlogged
cases

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:16.700 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
going down
 
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.750 align:start position:0%
going down
somewhat

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
that would be a yes
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:33.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
Ryan did you have a question
 
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.039 align:start position:0%
representative Gordon
 
00:28:38.039 --> 00:28:40.549 align:start position:0%
representative Gordon
no

00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
not not at this moment I do have some
 
00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:47.220 align:start position:0%
comments with regard to if we're just
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
following up on what representative
 
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
Smith has said then no but when we get
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
back to your agenda I do okay
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
so no but I just uh
 
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
thank you director Malachi for but again
 
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
it's an important question because one
 
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
of the big concerns everybody has maybe
 
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:07.799 align:start position:0%
not as it relates to 296 but just in is
 
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
we do have the accumulation rate and we
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about resources and
 
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.630 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about resources and
so

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
understanding the impact of the
 
00:29:18.049 --> 00:29:18.059 align:start position:0%
procedural changes you made with respect
 
00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
to that backlog is is critical so it
 
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
does sound like it's new it's only been
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
since February we're only in the
 
00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:27.419 align:start position:0%
September time frame so we understand
 
00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
the year over year
 
00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
things can change uh the amount of
 
00:29:33.409 --> 00:29:33.419 align:start position:0%
people filing can go up one year or down
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
the year after but in general
 
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
um you're processing more cases and
 
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.669 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
we had talked about the probable cause
 
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.210 align:start position:0%
we had talked about the probable cause
standard

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
um and so I did
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
uh have sent out
 
00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
an email with respect to uh the language
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any thoughts on that
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
um it should be and on page two of the
 
00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:39.769 align:start position:0%
um it should be and on page two of the
agenda

00:30:39.769 --> 00:30:39.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:40.860 align:start position:0%
so according to the statute
 
00:30:42.769 --> 00:30:42.779 align:start position:0%
determination of probable cause means a
 
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
determination made after investigation
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
that there is sufficient evidence upon
 
00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
which a fact finder would form a
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
reasonable belief that the respondent
 
00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
committed one or more unlawful practices
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
so um yeah uh just a one minor
 
00:31:00.289 --> 00:31:00.299 align:start position:0%
correction you had a letter
 
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
wrong in one of those words
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
because you said a reasonable person
 
00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.549 align:start position:0%
because you said a reasonable person
would

00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:07.559 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:10.860 align:start position:0%
when the standard is could
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
like Europe
 
00:31:25.389 --> 00:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
so yeah I have a thought yes it's the
 
00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:29.820 align:start position:0%
same thought I had last week the
 
00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
standard is so low it seems like it
 
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
pretty much be very easy to meet that
 
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.450 align:start position:0%
pretty much be very easy to meet that
standard

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:31:42.769 --> 00:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I have a couple of thoughts
 
00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.450 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I have a couple of thoughts
and

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:49.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
just to start out I
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
one of the and I know this is our last
 
00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
meeting it should be our last meeting
 
00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.130 align:start position:0%
meeting it should be our last meeting
but

00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:58.140 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if we should have heard
 
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
from the chair of the Commissioners or
 
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
from the Commissioners themselves
 
00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:07.140 align:start position:0%
as to
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
their responsibilities and their duties
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
because don't they have some involvement
 
00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:14.700 align:start position:0%
in deciding how the commission should
 
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.970 align:start position:0%
in deciding how the commission should
operate

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
operate
 
00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:18.769 align:start position:0%
operate
and

00:32:18.769 --> 00:32:18.779 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
the after we left the last meeting and
 
00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
as I was driving home was thinking
 
00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.669 align:start position:0%
as I was driving home was thinking
shouldn't

00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
00:32:27.769 --> 00:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
the chair of the commission
 
00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
be here
 
00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
explaining how the commission works and
 
00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
why it works the way it does but that's
 
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
another issue
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
the probable cause standard I think is
 
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
the issue I don't really I I understand
 
00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:45.769 align:start position:0%
the issue I don't really I I understand
and

00:32:45.769 --> 00:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
and director Malachi does a great job
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
and she's explained uh and she's very
 
00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
defensive of the process but I think the
 
00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.889 align:start position:0%
defensive of the process but I think the
process

00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
is the issue so she's defending the
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
process and basically saying the process
 
00:33:03.169 --> 00:33:03.179 align:start position:0%
works if only we had resources
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
well I don't think the process works
 
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion and the process does
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't work properly because we
 
00:33:11.399 --> 00:33:12.169 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't work properly because we
are

00:33:12.169 --> 00:33:12.179 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
addressing the issue of probable cause
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
we're basically having an investigator
 
00:33:18.409 --> 00:33:18.419 align:start position:0%
decide the case before the commission
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
ever hears it in fact
 
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
decides the case because the commission
 
00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
isn't hearing any cases it's only
 
00:33:27.409 --> 00:33:27.419 align:start position:0%
hearing four cases a year
 
00:33:27.419 --> 00:33:29.029 align:start position:0%
hearing four cases a year
so

00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:32.700 align:start position:0%
uh and I I was uh we we have another
 
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
email which we received uh at least the
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
committee members received indicates the
 
00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
when they have complaints come in
 
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
they uh they don't have an investigation
 
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
of probable cause they look at it make a
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
determination based upon the filings as
 
00:33:54.049 --> 00:33:54.059 align:start position:0%
to whether or not there's a sufficient
 
00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
basis to move forward and then schedule
 
00:33:59.210 --> 00:33:59.220 align:start position:0%
a hearing
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that there needs to
 
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
be some alteration with regard to the
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
probable cause process because
 
00:34:07.919 --> 00:34:09.889 align:start position:0%
probable cause process because
and

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:09.899 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:12.599 align:start position:0%
and yes I understand there's a delay in
 
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
appointing investigators perhaps because
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough investigators
 
00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:19.859 align:start position:0%
but I also heard testimony earlier that
 
00:34:22.129 --> 00:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
when the investigator has it these cases
 
00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
are lasting the investigator may not get
 
00:34:26.089 --> 00:34:26.099 align:start position:0%
appointed for a year
 
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
but these cases aren't getting closed
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
so something's happening in that process
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
and that's and that's that determination
 
00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
of probable cause
 
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
I said on another committee the Ethics
 
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
Committee where basically we do our
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
triage a complaint comes in and we look
 
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
and see if on the face it makes a
 
00:34:49.849 --> 00:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
reasonable claim but once it makes a
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable claim
 
00:34:53.329 --> 00:34:53.339 align:start position:0%
we don't hire an investigator to look
 
00:34:55.609 --> 00:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
what we do is we have both parties come
 
00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
in basically before the Ethics Committee
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
explain and then we make a determination
 
00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
of probable cause and whether or not
 
00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
there's a sufficient basis to go forward
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
with charges
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that there ought to
 
00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
be some alteration in this probable
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
cause process that's more reasonable and
 
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate than having an investigator
 
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that right now the
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
process as I understand it is the
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
investigator can't decide probable cause
 
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
but basically
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
does a full investigation makes a
 
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation and for the most part my
 
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
guess is the commissioner Robert a a
 
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
commissioner rubber stampson says yep
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
you're right and so
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh it seems to me that the Commissioners
 
00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
should be making could be making that
 
00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
determination and then making that
 
00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
instead of defending the process the one
 
00:35:59.089 --> 00:35:59.099 align:start position:0%
thing I haven't heard
 
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
and that's why I sort of would like to
 
00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:02.940 align:start position:0%
hear the commissioner here I have a
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner here the one thing I
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
haven't heard is
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
we think our system is acceptable that
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
that we we think our system is properly
 
00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
serving the people of the State of New
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'd like somebody from the
 
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
commission to tell me they think it as
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
adequately serving the people in the
 
00:36:23.569 --> 00:36:23.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
and if they could do that then I would
 
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
be surprised
 
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some change some
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
modification to make this system work
 
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
and and serve serve our constituents
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
those are my thoughts so uh to follow up
 
00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
on that a little bit oh actually
 
00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo you had a
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
question oh yes it's a question for
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative Gordon
 
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
um representative Gordon you mentioned
 
00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:50.510 align:start position:0%
um representative Gordon you mentioned
that

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:53.569 --> 00:36:53.579 align:start position:0%
um practically the investigator is the
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
one who's deciding whether the case has
 
00:36:58.970 --> 00:36:58.980 align:start position:0%
Merit and goes forward when you feel it
 
00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
should be the Commissioners is that
 
00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:02.569 align:start position:0%
should be the Commissioners is that
correct

00:37:02.569 --> 00:37:02.579 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
right now it is the Commissioners only
 
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
they're taking the recommendation of the
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
investigator so but my guess is that
 
00:37:11.089 --> 00:37:11.099 align:start position:0%
they're rubber stamping for the most
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
part yeah
 
00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you that recommendation
 
00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:17.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for your response um and I
 
00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
think that that's a big problem because
 
00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:23.060 align:start position:0%
I think that we want to see
 
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
transparency between all of the moving
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
parts of the um Human Rights Commission
 
00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
for instance um
 
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
an investigator does his investigation
 
00:37:37.849 --> 00:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
cut and dried hands it over to the
 
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
commission and like let them make the
 
00:37:41.329 --> 00:37:41.339 align:start position:0%
decision instead of the investigator
 
00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
making you know driving the driving a
 
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.870 align:start position:0%
making you know driving the driving a
bus

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
bus
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be
 
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
more fair and more clear
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:55.740 align:start position:0%
thank you representative De Lorenzo so
 
00:37:58.970 --> 00:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
uh representative Gordon just uh so it's
 
00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
my understanding then that if you look
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
at the legal language
 
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
uh in the profitable cause you're saying
 
00:38:06.839 --> 00:38:08.210 align:start position:0%
uh in the profitable cause you're saying
actually

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:08.220 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
that's adequate
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
it's more just on the process side
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
and probably because is is a
 
00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:24.780 align:start position:0%
uh it's a it's it should be a very low
 
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:26.030 align:start position:0%
uh it's a it's it should be a very low
standard

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:29.220 align:start position:0%
okay the problem will cause the names of
 
00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court said probable cause is
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
less than more likely than not
 
00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:36.300 align:start position:0%
and More Than A Reasonable Suspicion
 
00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
that has case law that says that and so
 
00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
it's a very low standard and that's the
 
00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
standard to move forward
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
to adjudication
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
but what's happening is you have an
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
investigator from what I can see who's
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
basically going out there doing this
 
00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
full investigation
 
00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:02.660 align:start position:0%
and coming back and saying hey you know
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
this this this k
 
00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
this is this is going to be the outcome
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
of the case basically
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
and then based upon that the parties
 
00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.310 align:start position:0%
and then based upon that the parties
settle

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
settle
 
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
but it it seems to me that it should be
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
probable cause should be the the
 
00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:23.220 align:start position:0%
beginning of the
 
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:25.740 align:start position:0%
should be the beginning of a process as
 
00:39:28.609 --> 00:39:28.619 align:start position:0%
opposed to as it is right now the end of
 
00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:29.940 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
because what is happening is they're
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
going through this whole process of
 
00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:36.900 align:start position:0%
probable cause and then as the Director
 
00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
just said most people are settling and
 
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
the reason they're settling is because
 
00:39:43.609 --> 00:39:43.619 align:start position:0%
you basically decided the case
 
00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
so I just I just want to kind of follow
 
00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
up you know with a question back for you
 
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
and then maybe a follow-up question for
 
00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:53.339 align:start position:0%
the for the director so with obviously
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
you've been a judge and you've sat on
 
00:39:58.490 --> 00:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee we have
 
00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
um the the the research
 
00:40:05.089 --> 00:40:05.099 align:start position:0%
um from uh Kristen Grant
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
in those
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
labor board Ethics Committee when it
 
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
comes to probable cause is there an
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
investigative process in those relative
 
00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
bodies and what's its nature relative I
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
mean we kind of we kind of talked about
 
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
the the investigation that goes on in
 
00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission
 
00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
comparatively speaking where do you see
 
00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:31.310 align:start position:0%
comparatively speaking where do you see
it

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
um in these other bodies in in most
 
00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
cases it's it's not uh in most bodies
 
00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
it's not an investigator that's going
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
out and investigating it's the parties
 
00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
that are responsible for showing the
 
00:40:47.569 --> 00:40:47.579 align:start position:0%
evidence that's needed to meet probable
 
00:40:50.089 --> 00:40:50.099 align:start position:0%
cause and
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
so for example uh if you have a criminal
 
00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
case a felony case uh you have to have
 
00:40:59.089 --> 00:40:59.099 align:start position:0%
probable cause in order for somebody to
 
00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
go to a trial that probably will cause
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
in a felony case is supposed to be made
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
within 20 days it was at least as far as
 
00:41:08.329 --> 00:41:08.339 align:start position:0%
felonies first it's concerned or
 
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
felonies in this in the circuit court
 
00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:12.839 align:start position:0%
within 20 days and it's up to the police
 
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
to say you know this is the evidence
 
00:41:17.329 --> 00:41:17.339 align:start position:0%
that we have it's up for the defendant
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
to say that's not true
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
and you make that determination and once
 
00:41:25.849 --> 00:41:25.859 align:start position:0%
you make the determination a quick
 
00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
determination then you schedule it for
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
trial and then the parties can do
 
00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.589 align:start position:0%
trial and then the parties can do
whatever

00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
the parties do whatever research they
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gordon director
 
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
Malachi the Human Rights Commission is
 
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's a bit of a unique entity
 
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
and it does have
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
so maybe you could kind of walk us
 
00:41:52.849 --> 00:41:52.859 align:start position:0%
through some of the history
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
um why would the Human Rights Commission
 
00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
have such a departure from these other
 
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
bodies with respect to uh the nature of
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
the investigation
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so that would actually be a
 
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:08.220 align:start position:0%
question for the legislature who created
 
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
us in 1965.
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
um but part of the confusion I think
 
00:42:15.849 --> 00:42:15.859 align:start position:0%
that's being there's a lot of
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
messing around with a lot of different
 
00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
things we are not criminal and so a lot
 
00:42:22.609 --> 00:42:22.619 align:start position:0%
of the explanations that have been given
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
specifically deal with criminal cases
 
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
which are very different from
 
00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
administrative law cases and I think
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
that's part of the problem with the
 
00:42:32.329 --> 00:42:32.339 align:start position:0%
confusion as to what we're discussing
 
00:42:35.329 --> 00:42:35.339 align:start position:0%
what's also being missed is that the
 
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
commission is we are police officers we
 
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
are a district attorney we are a defense
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
attorney to some degree if there's a
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
hearing and we have to represent the
 
00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:47.109 align:start position:0%
hearing and we have to represent the
complainant

00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
complainant
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
we do a variety of things we're the
 
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
judge we have a jury we are all of those
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
elements all put together in one and so
 
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
the problem is when we're discussing
 
00:43:01.609 --> 00:43:01.619 align:start position:0%
probable cause in a criminal case as the
 
00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
judge gets it and the people come before
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
them before the judge him or her
 
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
what is eloquently been missed is the
 
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
Nuance all of the investigation all of
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
the information gathering all of the
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
determination of can we go forward can
 
00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
we have a search warrant Can We Gather
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
this information that's done before it
 
00:43:23.089 --> 00:43:23.099 align:start position:0%
gets to the judge we do all of that so
 
00:43:25.609 --> 00:43:25.619 align:start position:0%
that is a part of our process it's not
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
that everything walks into the door nice
 
00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:28.980 align:start position:0%
and neat when you come into a courtroom
 
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
all of the legwork all of the research
 
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
all of the investigation of the in
 
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
talking to Witnesses and looking under
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
bushes and finding pieces of paper and
 
00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:40.140 align:start position:0%
books and all of those things all that's
 
00:43:41.089 --> 00:43:41.099 align:start position:0%
been done
 
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
so when the judge gets it in a criminal
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
case that work has been done when we
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
when something walks into our door it's
 
00:43:50.569 --> 00:43:50.579 align:start position:0%
as if someone walked into the police
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
department and said someone stole my car
 
00:43:56.569 --> 00:43:56.579 align:start position:0%
now someone has to be assigned to take
 
00:43:59.569 --> 00:43:59.579 align:start position:0%
the intake of who what who you are what
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
happened to your car and gather that
 
00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:02.940 align:start position:0%
information and then it goes through the
 
00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
process we do all of those processes we
 
00:44:07.609 --> 00:44:07.619 align:start position:0%
are not simply a court where something
 
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
is complete and walks into us and then
 
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
we make a determination and then
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
whatever happens after that happens we
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
are all of those processes from souped
 
00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
thank you director
 
00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:24.839 align:start position:0%
um so and and I take your point with
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
respect to the difference uh between the
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission and say a
 
00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
criminal court
 
00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
um one I I did ask
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
um uh Kristen to give us the the
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
difference uh between uh the Human
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission and the labor
 
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
department which I I thought were kind
 
00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
of similar which is why I kind of asked
 
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
her to kind of look at that and in that
 
00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.010 align:start position:0%
her to kind of look at that and in that
case

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
um from if you just go to the second
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
page of the agenda a hearing in the
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor on the other hand
 
00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
does not require showing a probable
 
00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
cause so it looks like in that situation
 
00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
it just goes forward
 
00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:05.220 align:start position:0%
um so again I'm just trying to
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
understand there's there's very very
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
different approaches here and why
 
00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
um if you have any understanding of why
 
00:45:17.809 --> 00:45:17.819 align:start position:0%
um there is a departure between say the
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
the process that um the labor folks we
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
use and and the process that you would
 
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.470 align:start position:0%
use and and the process that you would
use

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not familiar with how the
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
labor department is set up I mean I know
 
00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
they have significantly more
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
investigators than we do so that makes a
 
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
huge difference I'm not familiar with
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
their process so I can't really I can't
 
00:45:38.089 --> 00:45:38.099 align:start position:0%
speak to that
 
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
um I don't know why they don't do an
 
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
investigation first or or they do it
 
00:45:44.569 --> 00:45:44.579 align:start position:0%
later I don't know you had your hand up
 
00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
sure you could sit over there we did
 
00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
it's a work it's a work session so you
 
00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.290 align:start position:0%
it's a work it's a work session so you
could

00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:59.510 align:start position:0%
could
oh

00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
I got a lot of points I want to address
 
00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to try and keep it simple
 
00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:06.660 align:start position:0%
so we can move through it
 
00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative Smith why
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
does the HRC have such departure from
 
00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
the investigation that other agencies do
 
00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
I think that's because of the law that
 
00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
the HRC has been designed to
 
00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.170 align:start position:0%
the HRC has been designed to
administer

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
administer
 
00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:21.950 align:start position:0%
administer
um

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:23.819 align:start position:0%
there's that whole McDonald Douglas
 
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
burden shifting framework for employment
 
00:46:28.609 --> 00:46:28.619 align:start position:0%
law which basically says employee you
 
00:46:30.109 --> 00:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
have to present some evidence of your
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
Prima fashion case employer did you have
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
a legitimate non-discriminatory business
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
reason for doing the action and then the
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
employee gets to say well actually their
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
reason is is a bunch of
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
yes a bunch of Hui it's not right and
 
00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
here's what actually happened
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
um so I think the HRC does have to have
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a different
 
00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:50.220 align:start position:0%
investigation than other agencies but I
 
00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
agree the process can be changed it can
 
00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
be streamlined and made better
 
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:55.670 align:start position:0%
be streamlined and made better
um

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
I think that was the point I wanted to
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
I can hold off on my other points for
 
00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:04.140 align:start position:0%
now please yes
 
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
well no just just just a quick follow-up
 
00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:07.670 align:start position:0%
well no just just just a quick follow-up
so

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:09.900 align:start position:0%
um so they have that standard over at
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
the labor department
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
do you have any knowledge as to because
 
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
I wasn't around when the law was written
 
00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
in 1965. so as to why they would have
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
the the different standard at the Human
 
00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:25.140 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission my knowledge and I'm
 
00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
going to invite my my colleague Megan
 
00:47:28.849 --> 00:47:28.859 align:start position:0%
Douglas to jump up and correct me if she
 
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
has a different view but my knowledge of
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
that is when this law was implemented we
 
00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
wanted a gatekeeper to keep these cases
 
00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
from flooding the court system and so we
 
00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
wanted the HRC to basically operate
 
00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:45.300 align:start position:0%
at the gate and cut off any frivolous
 
00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
claims you know for example if somebody
 
00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:48.290 align:start position:0%
claims you know for example if somebody
says

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:48.300 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:49.670 align:start position:0%
says
um

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
my employer said that I have to tuck in
 
00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
my shirt to come to work so he's
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
discriminating against me because I'm a
 
00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:56.460 align:start position:0%
woman something like that would be a
 
00:47:58.130 --> 00:47:58.140 align:start position:0%
clearly frivolous claim
 
00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
and and that's the type of stuff that
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
the HRC is supposed to weed out before
 
00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
it ever makes it to the court so that we
 
00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:04.740 align:start position:0%
don't clog up the court system and I
 
00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
think that's how that got started in the
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:13.809 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:48:13.809 --> 00:48:13.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
unless there's yeah unless there's
 
00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
someone here from labor that could speak
 
00:48:20.089 --> 00:48:20.099 align:start position:0%
specifically to how labor does their
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
process I don't think we have an answer
 
00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
I mean I know what we do generally
 
00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
reflects how the EEOC which is the
 
00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:28.609 align:start position:0%
reflects how the EEOC which is the
federal

00:48:28.609 --> 00:48:28.619 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
um uh agency does their cases we
 
00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
generally generally reflect their
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
process so I can only assume dangerous
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
words but when the HRC was created that
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
it would reflect what was statutory for
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
that would be my guess if I had to
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
all right so I think we we I think we're
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
in a place right now where we talked
 
00:48:58.849 --> 00:48:58.859 align:start position:0%
about the probable cost standard we're
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the language we're
 
00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:01.849 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the language we're
saying

00:49:01.849 --> 00:49:01.859 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
are there some things maybe that we want
 
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
to do around process
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
um so we'll go on to that
 
00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:15.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
um when you were able to go and meet
 
00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
with the staff which I think you did at
 
00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
the beginning of September if I recall
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
or did you have an opportunity to read
 
00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
um one of the HRC reports to see what it
 
00:49:38.329 --> 00:49:38.339 align:start position:0%
was like
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
no I did not
 
00:49:44.569 --> 00:49:44.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
one I'm just curious about this whole
 
00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:50.300 align:start position:0%
question of the detail
 
00:49:55.329 --> 00:49:55.339 align:start position:0%
that um that are competent
 
00:49:59.210 --> 00:49:59.220 align:start position:0%
responsible investigator
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
appeals is necessary to go into that
 
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
report which seems to take a lot of time
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
and I was just curious
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
thanks Marissa and I just want to say
 
00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:33.770 align:start position:0%
thanks Marissa and I just want to say
Representatives

00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
um Megan and I didn't get a chance to
 
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
connect before this meeting so we're
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
happy to have copies made and sent
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
electronically to you all so that this
 
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
isn't the only copy
 
00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:44.390 align:start position:0%
isn't the only copy
um

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:45.650 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
I thought it would be helpful uh for you
 
00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
all to have a visual of of what um the
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
investigation looks like as finally
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
documented in the probable cause or no
 
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
probable cause determination report
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
um the problem in disseminating it is
 
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
that it's it's confidential in this case
 
00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:11.690 align:start position:0%
that it's it's confidential in this case
the

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
um the plaintiff wanted to stay at the
 
00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
commission precisely because it was a
 
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
confidential process she didn't want to
 
00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
go to court
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
um and so I took some time to redact the
 
00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.490 align:start position:0%
um and so I took some time to redact the
information

00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:27.500 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:29.940 align:start position:0%
and it took it took quite a while
 
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
because the report is lengthy
 
00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
um but what in my view the report shows
 
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:38.940 align:start position:0%
I'll just I'll tell you it's
 
00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:40.430 align:start position:0%
I'll just I'll tell you it's
one

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
two three
 
00:51:43.079 --> 00:51:44.450 align:start position:0%
two three
four

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:44.460 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:45.950 align:start position:0%
four
five

00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:47.450 align:start position:0%
five
six

00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:51.470 align:start position:0%
six
seven

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
I could have counted the page numbers
 
00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
huh nine single spaced Pages uh it looks
 
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
sort of like a summary judgment decision
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
um it looks it looks uh like the
 
00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:07.140 align:start position:0%
investigator here did this over the
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
course of years
 
00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:10.030 align:start position:0%
course of years
um

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:11.990 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
in this case despite the fact that the
 
00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
plaintiff had
 
00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
two three Witnesses corroborating
 
00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:22.069 align:start position:0%
two three Witnesses corroborating
um

00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
corroborating her her theory of the case
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
no probable cause was found
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
and so I thought it would be a good it
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to you also this one
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
this investigation shows
 
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
that the investigator was not able to
 
00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:40.569 align:start position:0%
that the investigator was not able to
contact

00:52:40.569 --> 00:52:40.579 align:start position:0%
contact
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
an important witness until he was he
 
00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
separated from employment for 19 months
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
so it was it was
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
um a year and a half that he was out of
 
00:52:59.809 --> 00:52:59.819 align:start position:0%
the job where this lady worked
 
00:53:02.569 --> 00:53:02.579 align:start position:0%
um and consequently he didn't remember
 
00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:05.220 align:start position:0%
her at all at least he said he didn't
 
00:53:07.609 --> 00:53:07.619 align:start position:0%
and he wasn't able to say anything that
 
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
was helpful to her even though years
 
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
prior she would had identified him as an
 
00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:13.980 align:start position:0%
important Witness
 
00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:16.069 align:start position:0%
important Witness
so

00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
um again no probable cause was found
 
00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:21.530 align:start position:0%
um again no probable cause was found
um

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
I I I'm happy to I'm
 
00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to to to send this around the
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
table I I think I did a fairly good job
 
00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
of of redacting
 
00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:34.140 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if that means that
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily it's publicly accessible
 
00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:40.910 align:start position:0%
 
what

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
what does everybody think about that
 
00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:49.490 align:start position:0%
what does everybody think about that
huh

00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.370 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:54.290 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.809 align:start position:0%
um
okay

00:53:56.809 --> 00:53:56.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:56.819 --> 00:53:57.530 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:53:57.530 --> 00:53:57.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:59.450 --> 00:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
well I guess you can look at it from
 
00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:01.250 align:start position:0%
well I guess you can look at it from
afar

00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
afar
 
00:54:04.609 --> 00:54:04.619 align:start position:0%
um it does exist I mean I guess I'll
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
you'll have to accept my representations
 
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
as to what what's in here I can tell you
 
00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:11.220 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the case if that
 
00:54:20.569 --> 00:54:20.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:20.579 --> 00:54:21.849 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:54:21.849 --> 00:54:21.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:25.140 align:start position:0%
the iris is stemmed here I received it
 
00:54:29.290 --> 00:54:29.300 align:start position:0%
January 22nd my birthday uh in 2020.
 
00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:37.069 --> 00:54:37.079 align:start position:0%
um complainant was fired
 
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:51.130 --> 00:54:51.140 align:start position:0%
yeah I just want to respond to
 
00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's question a little
 
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
bit about what do these reports look
 
00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:56.390 align:start position:0%
bit about what do these reports look
like

00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
um one thing Megan said was that even
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
though the the plaintiff in this case
 
00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:02.220 align:start position:0%
had corroborating Witnesses no probable
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
cause was found that's really important
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
because the way the plaintiff
 
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
identifying corroborating Witnesses
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
probably occurred at that third stage
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
after the employer has already given
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
their reason and the plaintiff says no
 
00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:15.180 align:start position:0%
that's a bunch of Hui here are my
 
00:55:18.010 --> 00:55:18.020 align:start position:0%
Witnesses here's why these are important
 
00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
if the probable cause standard as
 
00:55:23.329 --> 00:55:23.339 align:start position:0%
written had been correctly applied
 
00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff should have had probable
 
00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
cause because like representative Gordon
 
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
said what's happening is that they're
 
00:55:30.109 --> 00:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
deciding the merits of the case and
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
that's not what's supposed to be done
 
00:55:32.809 --> 00:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
they're just supposed to be saying have
 
00:55:35.089 --> 00:55:35.099 align:start position:0%
you given me something to believe that
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
the type of discrimination you say
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
happened actually did
 
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
and if you've given me something even if
 
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
I don't necessarily believe it if some
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable person could that's good
 
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
enough check the box move on
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
and this is so detailed representative
 
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
Smith and analyzing every potential fact
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
in the case that it's going above and
 
00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
beyond what's required
 
00:55:59.329 --> 00:55:59.339 align:start position:0%
say I have gender discrimination at work
 
00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
and I've got five examples of how that's
 
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
happening to me if the probable cost
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
standard is applied correctly I only
 
00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
have to give the HRC one before they can
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
say okay you get to move to the next
 
00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:10.130 align:start position:0%
say okay you get to move to the next
step

00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:10.140 align:start position:0%
step
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
because I just have to give them some
 
00:56:13.549 --> 00:56:13.559 align:start position:0%
credible evidence that a reasonable
 
00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
representative Gordon in effect that's
 
00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:27.300 align:start position:0%
an adjudication of the claim
 
00:56:32.089 --> 00:56:32.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:34.609 --> 00:56:34.619 align:start position:0%
and and what happens what happened to
 
00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
this plaintiff is that she didn't
 
00:56:38.809 --> 00:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
because no probable cause was found she
 
00:56:38.819 --> 00:56:39.710 align:start position:0%
because no probable cause was found she
has

00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
she has no relief at all under RSA 354a
 
00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
she can't go to Superior Court and she
 
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
can't bring a 354a plane it's done she
 
00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
could appeal the no probable cause
 
00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:54.589 align:start position:0%
could appeal the no probable cause
decision

00:56:54.589 --> 00:56:54.599 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
um which I've done once and that case
 
00:57:00.109 --> 00:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
has been
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
it was remanded to the commission and
 
00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:04.380 align:start position:0%
it's now going on six years for the
 
00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:08.930 align:start position:0%
it's now going on six years for the
judication

00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo for Megan Hi
 
00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
Megan um so
 
00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
in that particular case you were
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
speaking of whether they found no
 
00:57:19.730 --> 00:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
probable cause and you know the case was
 
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
like just dropped right
 
00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
well is there an option or an Avenue to
 
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
go before the EEOC on a Case no because
 
00:57:32.089 --> 00:57:32.099 align:start position:0%
the charge is dually filed with
 
00:57:32.099 --> 00:57:32.930 align:start position:0%
the charge is dually filed with
um

00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:35.940 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission and the EEOC
 
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
there they have a work sharing agreement
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
so that one will investigate claims
 
00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:46.740 align:start position:0%
under both Title VII and RSA 354a now
 
00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
this this employee
 
00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:50.510 align:start position:0%
this this employee
um

00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
could have
 
00:57:55.849 --> 00:57:55.859 align:start position:0%
um brought claims in court under Title
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
VII this is a gender discrimination case
 
00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
she was a a female boss who cursed in in
 
00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:06.140 align:start position:0%
the workplace and it was decided that
 
00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:08.540 align:start position:0%
she broke
 
00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:12.140 align:start position:0%
the ethical code of the of the company
 
00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:14.460 align:start position:0%
meanwhile there was a comparator
 
00:58:17.329 --> 00:58:17.339 align:start position:0%
employee a male who was behaving pretty
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
badly on the regular and nothing
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
happened to him and that was the basis
 
00:58:26.329 --> 00:58:26.339 align:start position:0%
of her her claim she could have a
 
00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:28.740 align:start position:0%
brought title seven claims in court but
 
00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
she wanted to Avail of the confidential
 
00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:34.380 align:start position:0%
process the industry in which she worked
 
00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
was very
 
00:58:36.359 --> 00:58:37.849 align:start position:0%
was very
uh

00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the word is in insular
 
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
I mean there's very close
 
00:58:44.589 --> 00:58:44.599 align:start position:0%
um sorry
 
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
yes yes and actually she after she was
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
let go from this job she got a new job
 
00:58:53.450 --> 00:58:53.460 align:start position:0%
in another
 
00:58:58.430 --> 00:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
you know uh employer in the same Biz and
 
00:59:01.130 --> 00:59:01.140 align:start position:0%
um mysteriously that job
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
just evaporated it was offered her and
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
then right when she was about to start
 
00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
it was taken away and there were there
 
00:59:13.789 --> 00:59:13.799 align:start position:0%
were facts suggesting that there was a a
 
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
meeting held between the former employer
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
and the new employer
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
so there you go that's why she wanted to
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
stay at the at the commission
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:28.559 --> 00:59:30.289 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:59:30.289 --> 00:59:30.299 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
I guess though I'm
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to proceed at this
 
00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:43.140 align:start position:0%
point with obviously we said that we
 
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
think that the standard itself the
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
statutory language of of the standard is
 
00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.470 align:start position:0%
statutory language of of the standard is
good

00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
so this now just comes down to the the
 
00:59:58.490 --> 00:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
application in this particular case you
 
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
know we're going forward with a full
 
01:00:03.049 --> 01:00:03.059 align:start position:0%
adjudication it sounds like
 
01:00:03.059 --> 01:00:03.770 align:start position:0%
adjudication it sounds like
um

01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:05.510 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
do we do we look at
 
01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
bringing in statutory language that
 
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
really tightens up that process or I
 
01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
think that's
 
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
that's a big nut to pull off
 
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
representative McLean yes I could I
 
01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:23.220 align:start position:0%
actually have an idea about that and I
 
01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
don't think we need to bring in
 
01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:26.099 align:start position:0%
statutory language I think we could do
 
01:00:28.849 --> 01:00:28.859 align:start position:0%
it with the rules of the agency which
 
01:00:31.309 --> 01:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
have been expired now for five ish years
 
01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
the rules are several years well yeah
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
the three sections of the rules are
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
expired but we could amend those rules
 
01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.030 align:start position:0%
expired but we could amend those rules
um

01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
to address these issues that we're
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
discussing and I've actually our memo
 
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
that we set forth with the one year
 
01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:47.270 align:start position:0%
that we set forth with the one year
timeline

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
timeline
 
01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:48.839 align:start position:0%
I think would address most of these
 
01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:50.220 align:start position:0%
issues and this morning I've thought of
 
01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
new ideas to streamline that even more
 
01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
and make it even better cut down the
 
01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
investigation time but that would allow
 
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
in my view the HRC to allocate their
 
01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
resources such that they could
 
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
simultaneously investigate new cases
 
01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
coming in and address the backlog in
 
01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:07.740 align:start position:0%
more meaningful numbers because we'd be
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
we'd be decreasing their duties per
 
01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
investigator they'd have less things on
 
01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
their plate than the way they've been
 
01:01:13.809 --> 01:01:13.819 align:start position:0%
doing things
 
01:01:16.849 --> 01:01:16.859 align:start position:0%
and for example this memo that you all
 
01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:18.059 align:start position:0%
should have
 
01:01:18.059 --> 01:01:19.490 align:start position:0%
should have
at

01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
we put first quarter investigator has
 
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
initial this is at the bottom number
 
01:01:25.609 --> 01:01:25.619 align:start position:0%
three investigator has initial
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
discussion with complainant to determine
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
what documents and other evidence are
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
necessary to the case instead of doing
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
that we could cut that step and we could
 
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
put the form five the form that
 
01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
complainants fill out their charge of
 
01:01:39.049 --> 01:01:39.059 align:start position:0%
discrimination on we could add a second
 
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
page to the form five that has a
 
01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
checklist of documents that the
 
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
complainant has to identify at the
 
01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
outset for the commission I believe
 
01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:48.299 align:start position:0%
these documents exist that are relevant
 
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
and will show you that I I've met my
 
01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
proper cost standard please go get them
 
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
investigator and all the complainant has
 
01:01:55.849 --> 01:01:55.859 align:start position:0%
to do is check the box of the types of
 
01:01:57.530 --> 01:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
documents that might exist
 
01:02:00.410 --> 01:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
and then at the investigation phase we
 
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
can and this would take some time but a
 
01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
group of employment lawyers Nila and
 
01:02:07.210 --> 01:02:07.220 align:start position:0%
nhaj could work together to devise
 
01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
checklists by the type of claim such
 
01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:11.700 align:start position:0%
that when the investigator gets into the
 
01:02:13.849 --> 01:02:13.859 align:start position:0%
investigation all they have to do is is
 
01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
look at this checkbox list and say
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
have they offered me some evidence that
 
01:02:20.809 --> 01:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
they're disabled check the box yes have
 
01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:22.140 align:start position:0%
they offered me some evidence that they
 
01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
asked for accommodation yes have they
 
01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:25.799 align:start position:0%
offered me some evidence that they were
 
01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
terminated because they offered because
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
they asked for accommodation yes if so
 
01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
proceed to commissioners
 
01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.829 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
pardon my ignorance since that's so
 
01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
since that's
 
01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.230 align:start position:0%
since that's
um

01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:44.460 align:start position:0%
being taken up potentially in in the
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
rules which is saying have been expired
 
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:48.839 align:start position:0%
for for quite some time
 
01:02:48.839 --> 01:02:50.870 align:start position:0%
for for quite some time
um

01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:53.089 --> 01:02:53.099 align:start position:0%
and this is just me being ignorant
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
what what would the mechanism for that
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
be and and would we as a legislature
 
01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
have a have a role in that or what what
 
01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
is what is the mechanism by which that
 
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
comes to pass
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
I believe the rules are amended through
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
gel car and my understanding which may
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
not be correct my understanding is that
 
01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:14.339 align:start position:0%
the HRC itself is responsible for
 
01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
amending those rules and submitting them
 
01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:19.020 align:start position:0%
to gel car under the APA and I see
 
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
nodding heads so I'm thinking I'm maybe
 
01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
right on this one but
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
I would be willing and I can't speak for
 
01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
other employment lawyers except for this
 
01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
one but you know we'd be willing to help
 
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
come up with some rules so that the
 
01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
agency doesn't have to do this on their
 
01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
own we know they have other work to do
 
01:03:37.849 --> 01:03:37.859 align:start position:0%
and set setting time and people aside to
 
01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
come up with new rules is difficult
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we can gather up some other
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
employment lawyers as well and I'd also
 
01:03:46.609 --> 01:03:46.619 align:start position:0%
be happy to have committee input on you
 
01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
know our drought the employment lawyers
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
drafts of the rules see what what you
 
01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
guys think about those and then maybe we
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
work with the HRC directly to get those
 
01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
passed through gel car just an idea I'm
 
01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
yes representable yeah and uh what we
 
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
would do is recommend to be a commission
 
01:04:07.630 --> 01:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
to rewrite the rules
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
a special Commission
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
okay well so we're an interim study we
 
01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
we have a bill and we say we're going to
 
01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
study that and we'll figure out what to
 
01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.109 align:start position:0%
study that and we'll figure out what to
recommend

01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
well what we can recommend might be to
 
01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
have a commission to rewrite the rules
 
01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:27.420 align:start position:0%
under which the HRC is operating not
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily I mean accepting the statute
 
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
where it is
 
01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
but just looking at rewriting how the
 
01:04:37.609 --> 01:04:37.619 align:start position:0%
commission is actually operating
 
01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
so that's a that's one thing we can do
 
01:04:42.770 --> 01:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
from here
 
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
I think that would be great and I also
 
01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
know that from my memo
 
01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:49.260 align:start position:0%
I had written in here that we need some
 
01:04:51.049 --> 01:04:51.059 align:start position:0%
type of mechanism for enforcement or
 
01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
penalty and I know I didn't provide any
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
suggestions about how we might do that
 
01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
we've come up with some ideas
 
01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
um RSA 189 13 and 189 31 are statutes
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
governing the dismissal of teachers and
 
01:05:05.809 --> 01:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
essentially what it says is if a teacher
 
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
does certain bad things they can be
 
01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
dismissed and the superintendent gets to
 
01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
refer that teacher for dismissal to the
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
school board who then holds a little
 
01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
hearing it's more like a meeting but
 
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
they call it a hearing and the school
 
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
board makes a determination and the
 
01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
teacher might have to hit the road we
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
could do something very similar here
 
01:05:21.359 --> 01:05:22.990 align:start position:0%
could do something very similar here
where

01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
executive director acts as
 
01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
superintendent and the Commissioners act
 
01:05:30.049 --> 01:05:30.059 align:start position:0%
as a school board so if we outline these
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
new rules and we come up with a one year
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
or less process by which HRC can get a
 
01:05:37.370 --> 01:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
case done from start to finish and we
 
01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
see investigators or not we if the
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
executive director sees investigators
 
01:05:44.410 --> 01:05:44.420 align:start position:0%
who are not doing doing that who are not
 
01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:46.140 align:start position:0%
satisfactorily completing their job
 
01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:48.299 align:start position:0%
duties the executive director shall
 
01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
refer that in that investigator to the
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
Commissioners for review the
 
01:05:53.569 --> 01:05:53.579 align:start position:0%
Commissioners will sit with the
 
01:05:55.609 --> 01:05:55.619 align:start position:0%
investigator is there good cause for the
 
01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
reason you're not performing your duties
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
is it a delay of someone else tell me
 
01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
what happened and the Commissioners get
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
to decide whether or not the
 
01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
investigator continues at the commission
 
01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
I think that's something we could write
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
right into the rules as well
 
01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
I think it might work because it's it's
 
01:06:12.049 --> 01:06:12.059 align:start position:0%
borrowing from a republic employee
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
process right
 
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
um and it would give the executive
 
01:06:17.809 --> 01:06:17.819 align:start position:0%
director sufficient control
 
01:06:21.650 --> 01:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:24.049 --> 01:06:24.059 align:start position:0%
yes representative Smith
 
01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:27.059 align:start position:0%
thank you um you've all been terrific
 
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
you've given us lots of help and I think
 
01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
all of us in this room want to see this
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
this agency work
 
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
I personally am not thrilled with what
 
01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
you just suggested because the problem
 
01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:42.589 align:start position:0%
you just suggested because the problem
is

01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
that the investigators are doing now
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
what they are expected to do and what
 
01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
the and what the director holds them
 
01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
to do in terms of how long the cases go
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
and whatever
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
so I don't think
 
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:01.140 align:start position:0%
that that solves anything I think we
 
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
have to solve the underlying issue which
 
01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
is the
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
the fact that the investigators working
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
hard and doing due diligence have in
 
01:07:17.329 --> 01:07:17.339 align:start position:0%
fact ended up acting as almost in the
 
01:07:20.809 --> 01:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
the director of being judge and jury
 
01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:28.140 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:07:30.849 --> 01:07:30.859 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
we don't have to form a commission which
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
can go on forever and ever we don't have
 
01:07:37.789 --> 01:07:37.799 align:start position:0%
to do any of those things what we have
 
01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
to do is say very clearly that the
 
01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:43.549 align:start position:0%
to do is say very clearly that the
language

01:07:43.549 --> 01:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
um the language should clarify the fact
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
that in order to get to probable cause
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
it it is just to establish certain basic
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
facts and that is probable cause
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
probable cause is not the trial
 
01:08:07.609 --> 01:08:07.619 align:start position:0%
um and and that can be done and we can
 
01:08:07.619 --> 01:08:09.650 align:start position:0%
um and and that can be done and we can
uh

01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:14.700 align:start position:0%
uh gel cars meanwhile should be asking
 
01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
why five years have passed and and there
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
hasn't been a review of the rules
 
01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
um and all of that we can do in in
 
01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:26.769 align:start position:0%
um and all of that we can do in in
recommendations

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:26.779 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
and that would put when the new jail car
 
01:08:33.229 --> 01:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
is formed after the election
 
01:08:33.239 --> 01:08:34.550 align:start position:0%
is formed after the election
um

01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
we can be right there and
 
01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
related to the other efforts that we're
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
we're working on and and move this along
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
I I think that everybody in the
 
01:08:50.749 --> 01:08:50.759 align:start position:0%
commission it is is acting in good faith
 
01:08:52.610 --> 01:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
they're doing what they think they're
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
expected to do and
 
01:08:58.849 --> 01:08:58.859 align:start position:0%
we just disagree with what they're
 
01:09:02.209 --> 01:09:02.219 align:start position:0%
expected to do they're not expected
 
01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
the investigator is not expected
 
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
to conduct what I'm calling a trial just
 
01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
in shorthand I think we all know what I
 
01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:11.749 align:start position:0%
in shorthand I think we all know what I
mean

01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
that should make
 
01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
Ms Malachi's work a heck of a lot easier
 
01:09:23.209 --> 01:09:23.219 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me and we would be
 
01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
helping her address what seems to be one
 
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
of her very real concerns which is the
 
01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.709 align:start position:0%
of her very real concerns which is the
backlog

01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
backlog
 
01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
and if I may just respond briefly yes
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
please um I agree with you
 
01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
representative Smith that I think the
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
people there are working in good faith
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to pet agencies are
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
made of people and people are subject to
 
01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
human error even when they're doing
 
01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
their best job and and putting their
 
01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
best foot forward so if we were going to
 
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
do some type of change to the process
 
01:09:52.249 --> 01:09:52.259 align:start position:0%
and the rules I would propose that we
 
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
first revise the process like we've been
 
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
talking about a one-year timeline
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
checklist Etc and then we delay
 
01:10:00.169 --> 01:10:00.179 align:start position:0%
implement we give that we give the
 
01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
investigators time to adjust to this new
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
these new workplace expectations
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
and then at some point maybe we consider
 
01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
implementing the process of if executive
 
01:10:14.290 --> 01:10:14.300 align:start position:0%
director sees people failing to
 
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
satisfactorily complete their job duties
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
she may consider referring them to the
 
01:10:18.719 --> 01:10:20.149 align:start position:0%
she may consider referring them to the
Commissioners

01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
Commissioners
 
01:10:20.159 --> 01:10:45.850 align:start position:0%
Commissioners
um

01:10:45.850 --> 01:10:45.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:48.900 align:start position:0%
try to
 
01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
do the right thing
 
01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:53.330 align:start position:0%
do the right thing
ideally

01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:53.340 align:start position:0%
ideally
 
01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
as painful as this process has been for
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
all of us and it has been very big
 
01:10:59.630 --> 01:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
blowing up for me and I think for
 
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
everybody else ideally we can come out
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:07.130 align:start position:0%
of this
um

01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
with a dead or able to meet the needs of
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
the citizens of the state who were alive
 
01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
on the Human Rights Commission and
 
01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
and make it possible for the staff to do
 
01:11:22.010 --> 01:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
her job and their job isn't
 
01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
to an effective to trials
 
01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm so I I think yeah I think you
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
know I've never worked in in state
 
01:11:33.050 --> 01:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
governments but I'm certain that like
 
01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
any other agency even in the private
 
01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
sector that you know director Malachi
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
holds reviews with her people and if
 
01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
they're not performing then you know
 
01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
there's accountability there but what I
 
01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
was thinking about and I was giving a
 
01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
lot of thought especially in light of we
 
01:11:50.930 --> 01:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
got a memo from the committee researcher
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
just looking at other agencies
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
um and it doesn't seem to be a lot of
 
01:11:59.090 --> 01:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
you know penalizing individuals I was
 
01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:00.900 align:start position:0%
thinking something I just want to get
 
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
your thoughts along the lines of you
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
know in the rules process
 
01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
really codifying if there's
 
01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
non-cooperation with the commission like
 
01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:13.739 align:start position:0%
when I was in there and I was speaking
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
with folks they say you know in the past
 
01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
um we would ask for this and there might
 
01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
be people dragging their their feet or
 
01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
things of this nature and sometimes when
 
01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
we were really overwhelmed we would let
 
01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
that go because we were overwhelmed and
 
01:12:28.370 --> 01:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
actually it gave us a little bit of a
 
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
breather but I I was thinking maybe if
 
01:12:33.890 --> 01:12:33.900 align:start position:0%
you're going to revisit the rules from a
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
penalty perspective it might just be if
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
you're non-complying or non-cooperating
 
01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
that's ground you know for immediate
 
01:12:42.970 --> 01:12:42.980 align:start position:0%
loss of your case or something like that
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
I was thinking something along those
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
lines what are your what are your
 
01:12:48.290 --> 01:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
I think that I think that certainly if
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
if a respondent isn't
 
01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
um compliant with an investigator's
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
request for information for example then
 
01:13:02.330 --> 01:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
no probable cause should be found I mean
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
sorry probable cause should be found
 
01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
right my mistake
 
01:13:09.649 --> 01:13:09.659 align:start position:0%
um I think what Sam and I were trying to
 
01:13:09.659 --> 01:13:11.270 align:start position:0%
um I think what Sam and I were trying to
brainstorm

01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
brainstorm
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
was well what what happens if we've we
 
01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:15.900 align:start position:0%
have a rule in the statute that says
 
01:13:17.689 --> 01:13:17.699 align:start position:0%
investigation shall be done in two years
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
and they're just not
 
01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
um and they're they're not and and
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
they're not for for reasons that aren't
 
01:13:27.649 --> 01:13:27.659 align:start position:0%
um sound
 
01:13:27.659 --> 01:13:29.270 align:start position:0%
um sound
right

01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
um we wanted you we thought you all had
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
questions about about accountability and
 
01:13:39.229 --> 01:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
enforcing whenever we put in 354a and so
 
01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
we we tried to come up with something
 
01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:43.189 align:start position:0%
we we tried to come up with something
that

01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:43.199 --> 01:13:44.090 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
held people accountable but also you
 
01:13:50.209 --> 01:13:50.219 align:start position:0%
know gave people process and rested most
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
of the authority in in the executive
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
director for accountability with that's
 
01:13:56.930 --> 01:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
what that's why we we looked to the
 
01:13:59.450 --> 01:13:59.460 align:start position:0%
teacher statute okay
 
01:14:02.890 --> 01:14:02.900 align:start position:0%
I can't think of any I can't think of
 
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
any situation where an agency is a body
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
is punished for not doing its job I I I
 
01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't think of
 
01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:15.350 align:start position:0%
couldn't think of
any

01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:14:17.930 --> 01:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
analogous situation so that's why we
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
looked to the teacher statute too and I
 
01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
would just add on to that if we clarify
 
01:14:27.770 --> 01:14:27.780 align:start position:0%
the standard alone I don't think that's
 
01:14:29.450 --> 01:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
going to be enough to move these cases
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
through quickly enough to get a
 
01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
significant reduction in the backlog I
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
think they have a very hard job over
 
01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
there and I think we can make it work
 
01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
with the resources they've got if we
 
01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:40.370 align:start position:0%
with the resources they've got if we
just

01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
give them some tools you know it's a com
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's a complex area of the law but
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
luckily we have a bunch of employment
 
01:14:47.209 --> 01:14:47.219 align:start position:0%
lawyers practicing this area regularly
 
01:14:49.729 --> 01:14:49.739 align:start position:0%
who can give them tools to simplify
 
01:14:51.229 --> 01:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
their job
 
01:14:51.239 --> 01:14:52.370 align:start position:0%
their job
um

01:14:52.370 --> 01:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
I wish that I had a checklist of
 
01:14:56.209 --> 01:14:56.219 align:start position:0%
elements of the law at my fingertips
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
every single day that'd be awesome
 
01:14:59.630 --> 01:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
because they'd make my job simpler we
 
01:15:01.610 --> 01:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
could do that for them
 
01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
you know I I do agree
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
um that further clarifying the probable
 
01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
cause language you know based on some of
 
01:15:11.630 --> 01:15:11.640 align:start position:0%
the discussion today and the comments
 
01:15:14.050 --> 01:15:14.060 align:start position:0%
you know from a representative Gordon
 
01:15:16.370 --> 01:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
we're probably in a good place with
 
01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
respect to that language it it it's I
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
think it's just a just a question of of
 
01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:23.810 align:start position:0%
think it's just a just a question of of
application

01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
application
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
um but I would
 
01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
oh did you have a question
 
01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
okay so but but I I did I did want to
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
give the the director we've been talking
 
01:15:37.490 --> 01:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
a lot about the fact that we haven't had
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
rules in a while and we'd like to go
 
01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
back and revisit the rules and things
 
01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
like that so I would like just to give
 
01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
you the opportunity to give your
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that uh do you think that's
 
01:15:49.729 --> 01:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
a good way to go
 
01:15:49.739 --> 01:15:50.630 align:start position:0%
a good way to go
um

01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
why is it uh
 
01:15:56.689 --> 01:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
just yeah just what what are your
 
01:15:58.930 --> 01:15:58.940 align:start position:0%
thoughts with respect to basically
 
01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
moving through the rules process in this
 
01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:04.010 align:start position:0%
moving through the rules process in this
area

01:16:04.010 --> 01:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:05.090 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you so much to unpack
 
01:16:11.090 --> 01:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
um we do need to go through gel car
 
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
period full stop
 
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
um I don't agree with the majority of
 
01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
what complainants bar shared you know we
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
could as soon as something comes in and
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
it meets prima facie we could just
 
01:16:25.850 --> 01:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
Market probable cause and move on
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
whether the respondent responds or not I
 
01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
mean that would certainly be easier and
 
01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
we would move things through I don't
 
01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
think that's what any of us want because
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
then that's not giving the respondent an
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to respond so part of the
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
process is that there's checks and
 
01:16:47.330 --> 01:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
balances along the way and based on the
 
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
suggestions it's removing some of those
 
01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:52.140 align:start position:0%
checks and balances I think the Attorney
 
01:16:54.649 --> 01:16:54.659 align:start position:0%
General's office is smart enough to
 
01:16:57.050 --> 01:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
assist us with any check sheets that we
 
01:16:58.729 --> 01:16:58.739 align:start position:0%
might need I don't think we need their
 
01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
assistance in doing that I appreciate
 
01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:03.900 align:start position:0%
the offer we do have internal things but
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
I think part of it goes back to there's
 
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
still a lack of clear understanding as
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
to what we do these sessions whether
 
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
it's a hearing or these meetings are
 
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
very specific questions and very pointed
 
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
questions which is great but unless you
 
01:17:22.130 --> 01:17:22.140 align:start position:0%
come and look and look at a charge as
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
it's walking in and take some time with
 
01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
us to understand our process you're
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
still missing so much of the nuance and
 
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
the report that was shared with you was
 
01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
from 2020 which was part of the problem
 
01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
we don't do reports like that anymore
 
01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
but if you have a complainants bar that
 
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
is slowing down the process if we're
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
going to assess penalties then everybody
 
01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
gets a penalty not just one side so I
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:59.570 --> 01:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
there are some areas of the rules that
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
we would like to tighten there are some
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
things that need explanations there's
 
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
some things that we do that maybe we
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do anymore prohawk viche long
 
01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
conversation but putting that on the
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
record maybe we don't need to do those
 
01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
and then that removes some opportunities
 
01:18:17.810 --> 01:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
for certain attorneys outside of the
 
01:18:19.729 --> 01:18:19.739 align:start position:0%
state to practice before us maybe
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
there's a different process that doesn't
 
01:18:23.570 --> 01:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
involve us that that should take place
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
so that's something important but I
 
01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:30.540 align:start position:0%
think the agency itself with the
 
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
guidance of the Attorney General's
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
office can manage to make it through
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
jail car looking at our rules having our
 
01:18:39.770 --> 01:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
commissioners approve them and then that
 
01:18:41.810 --> 01:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
whole process is public anyway so if
 
01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
others want to make comments and
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
suggestions they're welcome to do so it
 
01:18:46.729 --> 01:18:46.739 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that we need to adopt them
 
01:18:51.610 --> 01:18:51.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo
 
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr clear
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you Miss Malachi thank you for
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
all of your hard work
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
um so I was wondering is there a
 
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
National Organization of professionals
 
01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
like Professional Organization for state
 
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination agencies that you
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
that you might be a member of or
 
01:19:15.649 --> 01:19:15.659 align:start position:0%
different states and members of
 
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
um other than the EEOC because that's
 
01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
who we practice with we usually are in a
 
01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:22.860 align:start position:0%
work sharing agreement so other than
 
01:19:25.490 --> 01:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
that that's all that I'm aware of
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
I thought it might be helpful if there
 
01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
were a National Association of you know
 
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
folks who work for anti-discrimination
 
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
state agencies because that's you know
 
01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
that's where a lot of um you know um
 
01:19:43.130 --> 01:19:43.140 align:start position:0%
practices get polished and
 
01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:44.630 align:start position:0%
practices get polished and
agencies

01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:46.130 align:start position:0%
agencies
um

01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:48.530 align:start position:0%
um
they

01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
I guess I would say they advocate for
 
01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
themselves and learn new practices and
 
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
there's always training and stuff yes um
 
01:19:58.669 --> 01:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
well the eeoc's process is a bit
 
01:19:58.679 --> 01:20:00.110 align:start position:0%
well the eeoc's process is a bit
different

01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
um and they do move it a lot faster
 
01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
because what they do is they set
 
01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
priorities every year so let's say
 
01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:08.209 align:start position:0%
priorities every year so let's say
um

01:20:08.209 --> 01:20:08.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
immigrant workers minority workers and
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
women are their 2023 priorities if your
 
01:20:18.410 --> 01:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
case isn't really rock solid you are
 
01:20:21.290 --> 01:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
dismissed there is no investigation
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
they give you a right to sue and you're
 
01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
out the door you're done so that would
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
help us as well if we adopted what the
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
EEOC did but but the commission based on
 
01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
how it's created has elected not to do
 
01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
that and to provide full investigation
 
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
that's relative to whoever's asking the
 
01:20:41.330 --> 01:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
question but but to provide an
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
investigation so everything that walks
 
01:20:44.570 --> 01:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
in the door
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
is going to get something someone look
 
01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
is really looking at it not just well
 
01:20:52.010 --> 01:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
this doesn't quite meet our criteria or
 
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
this one isn't very strong there could
 
01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
be something there but it makes Prima
 
01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
fascia but that's it and then it gets
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:04.970 --> 01:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
follow up so does your do your work is
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
at your agency attend any HUD trainings
 
01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
on Fair Housing that type of thing so
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
there is a HUD training annually and the
 
01:21:15.410 --> 01:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
EEOC participates in that it's a civil
 
01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
rights training and they do attend that
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
every year I have made sure there's
 
01:21:21.169 --> 01:21:21.179 align:start position:0%
money in my budget for them to attend
 
01:21:23.209 --> 01:21:23.219 align:start position:0%
that and if there are any trainings that
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
are online at this point because of
 
01:21:27.290 --> 01:21:27.300 align:start position:0%
covid things are a lot more accessible
 
01:21:29.870 --> 01:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
whether the EEOC is offering it we
 
01:21:32.090 --> 01:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
always take those trainings or one of
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
the other sister agencies in New England
 
01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
that offer something the staff will take
 
01:21:38.930 --> 01:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
those or if there are other trainings
 
01:21:40.490 --> 01:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
that are approved they will take those
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:50.090 --> 01:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
good question
 
01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:52.250 align:start position:0%
good question
um

01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
you've heard to the complainant bar and
 
01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
um the earlier Witnesses conferred to
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
refer to the employment
 
01:22:06.669 --> 01:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
bar so
 
01:22:09.169 --> 01:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
in in that case I don't know I should
 
01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
ask you or or that
 
01:22:14.689 --> 01:22:14.699 align:start position:0%
whether all the attorneys
 
01:22:18.430 --> 01:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
in the employment bar are there to
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
represent the complainants rather than
 
01:22:23.930 --> 01:22:23.940 align:start position:0%
employers there are attorneys that
 
01:22:25.610 --> 01:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
represent both sides
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
so like the attorneys we have here they
 
01:22:30.530 --> 01:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
customarily will have they represent an
 
01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
individual that's bringing a charge and
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
then there are other attorneys that will
 
01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
represent the company that is responding
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
to the charge but so the group that
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
well let me ask you so do you
 
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
when you gave us suggestions are the
 
01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
suggestions only from those people who
 
01:22:57.310 --> 01:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:05.330 --> 01:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
yeah director Ed
 
01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:09.370 align:start position:0%
yeah director Ed
um

01:23:09.370 --> 01:23:09.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:12.649 --> 01:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
started off at the last session or the
 
01:23:15.050 --> 01:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
session before that just saying that it
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that if I were a
 
01:23:19.850 --> 01:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
litigant that I would have a reasonable
 
01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
expectation that my case would be
 
01:23:26.990 --> 01:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
resolved in a fairly timely manner maybe
 
01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
in a year
 
01:23:30.050 --> 01:23:30.060 align:start position:0%
that might not be consistent with the
 
01:23:31.370 --> 01:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
current statute
 
01:23:33.950 --> 01:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me that if I were to go
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
to court I would expect my case or I
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
hope my case would be resolved within a
 
01:23:38.159 --> 01:23:38.750 align:start position:0%
hope my case would be resolved within a
year

01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:40.250 align:start position:0%
year
and

01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:43.729 --> 01:23:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:46.970 --> 01:23:46.980 align:start position:0%
and that's not happening now and we're
 
01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
not doing it within two years where it's
 
01:23:52.370 --> 01:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
taking longer than that so
 
01:23:54.350 --> 01:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
and from what you just said we were
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
talking about making changes in the
 
01:23:58.930 --> 01:23:58.940 align:start position:0%
rules in order to
 
01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
facilitate change to maybe speed up the
 
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
process to make it work and perhaps get
 
01:24:07.729 --> 01:24:07.739 align:start position:0%
it down to a year
 
01:24:07.739 --> 01:24:09.290 align:start position:0%
it down to a year
so

01:24:09.290 --> 01:24:09.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
but you've indicated that you don't
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
think that there's a knee I I don't want
 
01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
to quote you but basically what you've
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
said is you don't see a need for major
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
changes in the rules or some changes
 
01:24:20.930 --> 01:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
that need to be made but no major
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
changes in the way you go about doing
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
things in the rules
 
01:24:26.159 --> 01:24:28.910 align:start position:0%
things in the rules
so

01:24:28.910 --> 01:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
other than adding resources which is
 
01:24:34.850 --> 01:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
what you've said in the past is you just
 
01:24:36.250 --> 01:24:36.260 align:start position:0%
need more
 
01:24:38.930 --> 01:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
investigators more people
 
01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
other than adding resources
 
01:24:43.850 --> 01:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
how would you go about bringing that
 
01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
time frame down to a year
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and actually time in court is
 
01:24:52.970 --> 01:24:52.980 align:start position:0%
two and a half years so longer
 
01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:55.610 align:start position:0%
two and a half years so longer
um

01:24:55.610 --> 01:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:58.250 --> 01:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
part of bringing that changing that time
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
frame is doing the internal changes that
 
01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
we've already done
 
01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
okay and then continuing to look at
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
other areas that could make things move
 
01:25:11.570 --> 01:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
faster so is it we're working right now
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
on creating a list actually a checklist
 
01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
but a list that goes to the respondent
 
01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
in their notice letter to say so we
 
01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
already tell them to hold on to all the
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
information but reminding them that you
 
01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
can send in on both sides if there's
 
01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
information that's important to your
 
01:25:32.330 --> 01:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
charge send it in you don't need to wait
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
until something is assigned part of it
 
01:25:38.689 --> 01:25:38.699 align:start position:0%
is is Staff turnover I mean I'm losing
 
01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
someone now to the federal government so
 
01:25:44.209 --> 01:25:44.219 align:start position:0%
some people they get in you're training
 
01:25:46.669 --> 01:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
them and then they don't work out so
 
01:25:48.290 --> 01:25:48.300 align:start position:0%
they're terminated some people get in
 
01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
they're doing a great job and they move
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
on to make more money whether it's
 
01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
within the state or outside of the state
 
01:25:57.770 --> 01:25:57.780 align:start position:0%
and when that happens because we have
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
five investigators when you lose one
 
01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
person the that's a fifth of your
 
01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
Workforce which means the people who are
 
01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
already doing what they're doing are
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
taking on those cases that were assigned
 
01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
because someone's already made them you
 
01:26:14.930 --> 01:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
know reached out so they're taking those
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
cases on which means what's what's
 
01:26:19.010 --> 01:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
waiting Waits a little longer until
 
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
those cases continue forward so that's
 
01:26:24.649 --> 01:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
the other part as to why it's important
 
01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
to have additional staff because if
 
01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:28.860 align:start position:0%
someone leaves or if someone's
 
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
terminated you know they leave on hey I
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
found a better job that's great or they
 
01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
are not doing a good job and they're
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
terminated you don't have such a seismic
 
01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
shift in your Workforce and something
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been really discussed I have
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
I don't have an administrator in my
 
01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
office right now and I haven't since
 
01:26:50.689 --> 01:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
2020. one of my investigators whose job
 
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
it is to investigate is doing
 
01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:54.290 align:start position:0%
it is to investigate is doing
administrative

01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:55.330 align:start position:0%
administrative
um

01:26:55.330 --> 01:26:55.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
administrative case work as well as her
 
01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:01.189 align:start position:0%
administrative case work as well as her
investigations

01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
01:27:01.199 --> 01:27:02.689 align:start position:0%
investigations
so

01:27:02.689 --> 01:27:02.699 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:05.090 --> 01:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
that's that's all a part of it it is
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
very nuanced and that is why not fully
 
01:27:10.970 --> 01:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
understanding what we do the limitations
 
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
that we're facing and how we're doing it
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
um is a challenge and because the staff
 
01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
was cut then that was in 2011 that was
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
why the time frame I believe was
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
increased to two years if you want to
 
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
make it one year in the statute that's
 
01:27:29.090 --> 01:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
fine but I need more staff in order to
 
01:27:31.370 --> 01:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
do it because if I only have the five or
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
if I end up with four and one person
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
leaves there is no way to make that work
 
01:27:38.930 --> 01:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
when you don't have the individuals that
 
01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
are responsible for their key things so
 
01:27:43.610 --> 01:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
along with administrative one
 
01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
investigator doing administrative work I
 
01:27:46.610 --> 01:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
do it as well
 
01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
and everything else that is on my plate
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
to do so to answer your question more
 
01:27:56.209 --> 01:27:56.219 align:start position:0%
fully we will continue to look at what
 
01:27:58.129 --> 01:27:58.139 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures internally we
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
can change and that is why there is such
 
01:28:02.090 --> 01:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
an amazing relationship with the AG's
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
office to help us look at this to tweak
 
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
and then I'm constantly talking to the
 
01:28:08.090 --> 01:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
investigators and we've come up with
 
01:28:10.689 --> 01:28:10.699 align:start position:0%
tool kits and things to send out to
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
unrepresented folks so they can do a lot
 
01:28:15.649 --> 01:28:15.659 align:start position:0%
of some of the charges on their own it
 
01:28:18.169 --> 01:28:18.179 align:start position:0%
still has to be looked at but then they
 
01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
can do some of that writing on their own
 
01:28:23.149 --> 01:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
which relieves some of one piece of for
 
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
intake but it doesn't change the volume
 
01:28:27.410 --> 01:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
of things that are coming in and the
 
01:28:29.090 --> 01:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
phone calls and the constant
 
01:28:33.410 --> 01:28:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:37.490 --> 01:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
any other thoughts or comments
 
01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative Smith
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
thank you um when you submitted your
 
01:28:46.729 --> 01:28:46.739 align:start position:0%
request to the governor
 
01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
did you uh request additional staff I
 
01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:51.169 align:start position:0%
did you uh request additional staff I
did

01:28:51.169 --> 01:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
good for you thank you
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
I requested four investigators and
 
01:28:58.910 --> 01:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
um a training person so that we can
 
01:29:01.610 --> 01:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
actually make some make some Headway in
 
01:29:03.770 --> 01:29:03.780 align:start position:0%
what's happening in the state and I have
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
a paralegal and I've requested to make
 
01:29:09.169 --> 01:29:09.179 align:start position:0%
that person full-time and to also have
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
my admin readminister the refunded or
 
01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
funded again I'm not sure the quite the
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
correct term for that as well as
 
01:29:21.050 --> 01:29:21.060 align:start position:0%
having the part-time person in intake
 
01:29:24.050 --> 01:29:24.060 align:start position:0%
having the funds put back for that then
 
01:29:25.729 --> 01:29:25.739 align:start position:0%
we would be fully staffed and I feel
 
01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:28.139 align:start position:0%
like we could really make a big dent in
 
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
so I think we're at a place right now we
 
01:29:41.090 --> 01:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
kind of went through the meat of the oh
 
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:50.390 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:52.129 --> 01:29:52.139 align:start position:0%
one thing I just want to clarify and
 
01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:53.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's probably an error on my
 
01:29:54.770 --> 01:29:54.780 align:start position:0%
part because I get a little excited I
 
01:29:57.050 --> 01:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
talk quickly I skip over things
 
01:29:58.970 --> 01:29:58.980 align:start position:0%
um I am not advocating that we deprived
 
01:30:00.649 --> 01:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
the respondents a chance to respond
 
01:30:01.970 --> 01:30:01.980 align:start position:0%
because that would actually be contrary
 
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
to what the law requires I am just
 
01:30:06.530 --> 01:30:06.540 align:start position:0%
advocating that we simplify the process
 
01:30:08.450 --> 01:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
of employee makes initial claims
 
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
employer responds employee then responds
 
01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
to employers response
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
um second point I would make is that I
 
01:30:18.290 --> 01:30:18.300 align:start position:0%
know director Malachi feels that the HRC
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
with the a assistant with the attorney
 
01:30:22.189 --> 01:30:22.199 align:start position:0%
general's assistance and working with
 
01:30:23.689 --> 01:30:23.699 align:start position:0%
gel car is sufficient to get these rules
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
passed respectfully I would say that
 
01:30:28.669 --> 01:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
that's been the situation for five-ish
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
however many years the rules have been
 
01:30:31.970 --> 01:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
expired and clearly that's not working
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
so I think some additional and I agree
 
01:30:36.169 --> 01:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
with director Malachi I think they
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
probably do need additional resources my
 
01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
proposal is offering them free resources
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
nobody has to pay for my time to help
 
01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
them come up with rules and I would not
 
01:30:47.330 --> 01:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
profess to know the ins and outs of what
 
01:30:49.250 --> 01:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
they do on a daily basis so I would want
 
01:30:51.770 --> 01:30:51.780 align:start position:0%
to work with director Malachi and anyone
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
else from the Human Rights Commission
 
01:30:54.770 --> 01:30:54.780 align:start position:0%
who's willing to help us get rules
 
01:30:56.570 --> 01:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
passed so I'm not there every day I
 
01:30:57.649 --> 01:30:57.659 align:start position:0%
don't know what goes on inside those
 
01:31:00.050 --> 01:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
walls but I do
 
01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
know the law that I practice in and
 
01:31:05.689 --> 01:31:05.699 align:start position:0%
I and some others and we can gather a
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
bigger group if we ever get to that
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
point are happy to pitch in our time and
 
01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
resources free of charge to get things
 
01:31:15.709 --> 01:31:15.719 align:start position:0%
moving I respect that director Malachi
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
has taken the initiative to implement
 
01:31:19.610 --> 01:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
internal processes to improve things I
 
01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
think that's really hard to do when you
 
01:31:22.729 --> 01:31:22.739 align:start position:0%
are under resourced and you're
 
01:31:24.050 --> 01:31:24.060 align:start position:0%
struggling just to keep up with the
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
day-to-day but
 
01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
if internal measures were enough I don't
 
01:31:30.649 --> 01:31:30.659 align:start position:0%
think we'd be here right now and that's
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
not to be dismissive to director Malachi
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
I think she's doing a great job it's
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
just that I think she's got a lot on her
 
01:31:38.570 --> 01:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
plate and maybe some help would be nice
 
01:31:42.110 --> 01:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
that's all I have a question
 
01:31:44.450 --> 01:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
representative dilorenzo all right
 
01:31:45.649 --> 01:31:45.659 align:start position:0%
um well thank you for your presentation
 
01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
and as you were speaking I was wondering
 
01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
if there are resources that may be able
 
01:31:53.689 --> 01:31:53.699 align:start position:0%
to help the um Human Rights Commission
 
01:31:53.699 --> 01:31:54.910 align:start position:0%
to help the um Human Rights Commission
workers

01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
workers
 
01:31:58.850 --> 01:31:58.860 align:start position:0%
and that could be maybe a special effort
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
by the bar association the New Hampshire
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
Bar Association because I know that like
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts I have the legal
 
01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
advocacy and Resource Center
 
01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
um which I I trained in a hundred
 
01:32:11.450 --> 01:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
thousand years ago
 
01:32:14.450 --> 01:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
um and then the law clinics at the law
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
school maybe some help there so I think
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
we have to be a little bit creative
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
maybe I see Annie's FaceTime but
 
01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
to help with the integer caseload or
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:42.110 --> 01:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
right anybody else
 
01:32:45.530 --> 01:32:45.540 align:start position:0%
okay oh representative Gordon just just
 
01:32:48.050 --> 01:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
comment and that is
 
01:32:51.050 --> 01:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
I uh and I I think that some Overture
 
01:32:52.490 --> 01:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
could be made to the governor's office
 
01:32:57.290 --> 01:32:57.300 align:start position:0%
as well in terms of making change in the
 
01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:00.780 align:start position:0%
department because I'm sure he's as
 
01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
aware of the governor as aware of the
 
01:33:07.850 --> 01:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:13.090 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:33:13.090 --> 01:33:13.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
so all right so
 
01:33:18.169 --> 01:33:18.179 align:start position:0%
let's just
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
kind of get into a little bit of the
 
01:33:23.209 --> 01:33:23.219 align:start position:0%
wrap up here so at as director Malik I
 
01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
said there's a there's a lot to unpack
 
01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:26.870 align:start position:0%
said there's a there's a lot to unpack
so

01:33:26.870 --> 01:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:28.610 --> 01:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:30.470 align:start position:0%
um but
um

01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of the path forward we're going
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
to have the executive session for the
 
01:33:36.770 --> 01:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
whole committee
 
01:33:39.649 --> 01:33:39.659 align:start position:0%
um in October at some point so I just
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
kind of want to get some consensus as to
 
01:33:46.370 --> 01:33:46.380 align:start position:0%
where we want to go and what we want to
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
bring forth to
 
01:33:48.719 --> 01:33:49.610 align:start position:0%
bring forth to
um

01:33:49.610 --> 01:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:52.610 --> 01:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
the broader committee so does anybody I
 
01:33:54.290 --> 01:33:54.300 align:start position:0%
have my thoughts but I don't want to
 
01:33:56.270 --> 01:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
kind of start with them so does anybody
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
have any thoughts that they'd like to
 
01:34:01.370 --> 01:34:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:03.770 --> 01:34:03.780 align:start position:0%
representative Lorenzo oh thank you Mr
 
01:34:06.110 --> 01:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
chair well I would like to work towards
 
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
um passing SB 296 you know make that the
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
priority and that's you know
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
with our committee
 
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.830 align:start position:0%
with our committee
okay

01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:21.649 --> 01:34:21.659 align:start position:0%
representative walper so unfortunately
 
01:34:24.410 --> 01:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
uh passing SB 296 is not within our
 
01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:25.390 align:start position:0%
uh passing SB 296 is not within our
purview

01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:25.400 align:start position:0%
purview
 
01:34:28.850 --> 01:34:28.860 align:start position:0%
the best we could do is say we recommend
 
01:34:31.010 --> 01:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
that right be reintroduced that's what I
 
01:34:32.810 --> 01:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
mean and passed okay
 
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
and all that would do as it's written
 
01:34:38.090 --> 01:34:38.100 align:start position:0%
would be to uh
 
01:34:40.250 --> 01:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
remove the right of the respondent to
 
01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
remove after finding is a probable cause
 
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
which I think would be a good thing
 
01:34:46.129 --> 01:34:46.139 align:start position:0%
don't get me wrong
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
but I don't think it does anything to
 
01:34:49.970 --> 01:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
resolve the
 
01:34:52.370 --> 01:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
situations that we're hearing about and
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
the timeline of all of this
 
01:34:57.770 --> 01:34:57.780 align:start position:0%
which is uh I think our greater concern
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
I think that's really why we're sitting
 
01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:03.129 align:start position:0%
I think that's really why we're sitting
here

01:35:03.129 --> 01:35:03.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
so I mean from my perspective uh the
 
01:35:08.570 --> 01:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
reason that we wanted to interim study
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
this was because we had concerns about
 
01:35:13.729 --> 01:35:13.739 align:start position:0%
the resources
 
01:35:15.890 --> 01:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
um at the Human Rights Commission to be
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
able to satisfy uh the requirements of
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
296. so I think
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
um actually pretty early on uh with
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
respect to the work of the subcommittee
 
01:35:29.689 --> 01:35:29.699 align:start position:0%
we came to an understanding that uh SB
 
01:35:31.850 --> 01:35:31.860 align:start position:0%
296 its original language is
 
01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:33.590 align:start position:0%
296 its original language is
constitutional

01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
um and uh that 48 other states already
 
01:35:40.129 --> 01:35:40.139 align:start position:0%
do it and that the Human Rights
 
01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
Commission does indeed have the
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
resources to do that so from that
 
01:35:44.639 --> 01:35:45.890 align:start position:0%
resources to do that so from that
perspective

01:35:45.890 --> 01:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
um the core of SB 296 as we received it
 
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
I would be comfortable going to the
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole and saying yes we
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
recommend this for future legislation
 
01:36:01.490 --> 01:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
it's constitutional other states do it
 
01:36:03.890 --> 01:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
the resources are there boom so from
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
that perspective I think we're okay
 
01:36:09.649 --> 01:36:09.659 align:start position:0%
there may be though an opportunity and
 
01:36:12.410 --> 01:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
you know part of our discussions have
 
01:36:14.090 --> 01:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
kind of unpacked some of the other
 
01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
things that are going on at the Human
 
01:36:17.330 --> 01:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission there may be though an
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity to add to that
 
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
um now we do have the performance audit
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
where we're going to hopefully go before
 
01:36:30.770 --> 01:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
the lpaoc in and ask for something and
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
they all kind of look to see where where
 
01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
does that kind of dovetail in with the
 
01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
other priorities of the of the state
 
01:36:40.729 --> 01:36:40.739 align:start position:0%
they may decide to go forward they may
 
01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
not decide to go forward but the other
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
area where I do think that we had broad
 
01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:48.610 align:start position:0%
area where I do think that we had broad
agreement

01:36:48.610 --> 01:36:48.620 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:36:52.970 --> 01:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
was on the fact that um it's worth going
 
01:36:55.810 --> 01:36:55.820 align:start position:0%
back and revisiting the rules
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
especially in light of the fact that
 
01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
they've been expired I think it was said
 
01:37:04.189 --> 01:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
for five years and so
 
01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
you know while uh and I and I don't know
 
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
what the what what would constitute that
 
01:37:12.590 --> 01:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
rule-making committee from jail car I I
 
01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
would assume you would have folks from
 
01:37:18.290 --> 01:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
the respondent side the claim inside you
 
01:37:20.689 --> 01:37:20.699 align:start position:0%
would have folks from the HRC or not so
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
you have some uh representative Smith
 
01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you I think you're you know you
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
you're making a good point that we can
 
01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:30.050 align:start position:0%
you're making a good point that we can
begin

01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
begin
 
01:37:32.090 --> 01:37:32.100 align:start position:0%
um by saying
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
the bill having reviewed the bills that
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
came to us
 
01:37:36.719 --> 01:37:38.390 align:start position:0%
came to us
um

01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
the bill is fine as far as it goes
 
01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:44.930 align:start position:0%
the bill is fine as far as it goes
however

01:37:44.930 --> 01:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:37:48.169 --> 01:37:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
three other areas
 
01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
that we think must be
 
01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:56.450 align:start position:0%
that we think must be
um

01:37:56.450 --> 01:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:00.250 --> 01:38:00.260 align:start position:0%
looked into one
 
01:38:04.850 --> 01:38:04.860 align:start position:0%
that we strongly urge
 
01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:06.770 align:start position:0%
that we strongly urge
uh

01:38:06.770 --> 01:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:11.209 --> 01:38:11.219 align:start position:0%
jail car and the commission to work
 
01:38:11.219 --> 01:38:12.850 align:start position:0%
jail car and the commission to work
together

01:38:12.850 --> 01:38:12.860 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:38:17.530 --> 01:38:17.540 align:start position:0%
to come up with new
 
01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:19.209 align:start position:0%
to come up with new
rules

01:38:19.209 --> 01:38:19.219 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
based on all the knowledge that we've
 
01:38:22.850 --> 01:38:22.860 align:start position:0%
had since that's probably number three
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
but I I said it first so I don't forget
 
01:38:25.199 --> 01:38:26.030 align:start position:0%
but I I said it first so I don't forget
it

01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
secondly that um
 
01:38:32.930 --> 01:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
we uh strongly urge
 
01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:33.890 align:start position:0%
we uh strongly urge
um

01:38:33.890 --> 01:38:33.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:37.550 --> 01:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh the performance audit group
 
01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:38.810 align:start position:0%
uh the performance audit group
to

01:38:38.810 --> 01:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:40.250 align:start position:0%
to
um

01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:44.510 --> 01:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
look into not the financial but you know
 
01:38:48.290 --> 01:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
the uh operational uh
 
01:38:53.810 --> 01:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
the performance piece of and third that
 
01:38:57.110 --> 01:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
we clarify either
 
01:39:00.410 --> 01:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
through rules or if necessary
 
01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
through statute
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
exactly what is meant
 
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.610 align:start position:0%
exactly what is meant
by

01:39:07.610 --> 01:39:07.620 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:08.450 align:start position:0%
by
um

01:39:08.450 --> 01:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:11.930 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:39:11.930 --> 01:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
I'm having a blank
 
01:39:17.689 --> 01:39:17.699 align:start position:0%
by probable cause thank you
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
um and uh and that
 
01:39:25.370 --> 01:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
we believe that our research has shown
 
01:39:28.610 --> 01:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
us that probable cause as it is
 
01:39:31.610 --> 01:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
interpreted currently
 
01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:32.270 align:start position:0%
interpreted currently
um

01:39:32.270 --> 01:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
by uh the commission uh
 
01:39:39.050 --> 01:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
goes further than our standard
 
01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
understanding of probable cause and
 
01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
probable cause should very clearly be
 
01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:46.129 align:start position:0%
probable cause should very clearly be
just

01:39:46.129 --> 01:39:46.139 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:39:46.139 --> 01:39:47.709 align:start position:0%
just
the

01:39:47.709 --> 01:39:47.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
initial judgment yet that yes which I
 
01:39:53.570 --> 01:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
use the word triage but maybe that's not
 
01:39:55.490 --> 01:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
the right word that yes this is
 
01:39:59.330 --> 01:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
something worth pursuing and that
 
01:40:03.649 --> 01:40:03.659 align:start position:0%
and I think we have to mention that
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
and hopes that
 
01:40:10.370 --> 01:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
when could be us we could present
 
01:40:13.129 --> 01:40:13.139 align:start position:0%
to um OLS
 
01:40:16.250 --> 01:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
uh a new bill
 
01:40:18.770 --> 01:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
everybody here except Ned could present
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
a new bill that
 
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.729 align:start position:0%
a new bill that
um

01:40:22.729 --> 01:40:22.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:22.739 --> 01:40:24.050 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:40:24.050 --> 01:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:26.330 --> 01:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
that includes in it the language that we
 
01:40:28.490 --> 01:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
think is fine that we got from the
 
01:40:31.970 --> 01:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
Senate plus a clarification of the
 
01:40:34.370 --> 01:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
interpretation of probable cause the
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
other two things are already legislative
 
01:40:40.129 --> 01:40:40.139 align:start position:0%
and that would be gel car and
 
01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
performance audit
 
01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:43.189 align:start position:0%
performance audit
so

01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so does that make sense to people
 
01:41:49.070 --> 01:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:51.290 --> 01:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
the only issue that I have with the
 
01:41:54.050 --> 01:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
probable cause definition
 
01:41:57.290 --> 01:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
it's in the statute it says it makes the
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
determination the standard that's
 
01:42:03.169 --> 01:42:03.179 align:start position:0%
applied is correct but then it says that
 
01:42:06.169 --> 01:42:06.179 align:start position:0%
the standard after investigation
 
01:42:09.290 --> 01:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
and I think that after investigation is
 
01:42:11.330 --> 01:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
the issue because
 
01:42:13.250 --> 01:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that you could find
 
01:42:15.770 --> 01:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
probable cause after you do the
 
01:42:18.290 --> 01:42:18.300 align:start position:0%
three-step process
 
01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
and of the initial complaint submission
 
01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:24.250 align:start position:0%
and of the initial complaint submission
the

01:42:24.250 --> 01:42:24.260 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
employer's response and then the
 
01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:27.950 align:start position:0%
employer's response and then the
complainants

01:42:27.950 --> 01:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
complainants
 
01:42:30.530 --> 01:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
subsequent response you could make a
 
01:42:32.450 --> 01:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
public cause without necessarily having
 
01:42:39.290 --> 01:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
yes so just one second I set a question
 
01:42:45.169 --> 01:42:45.179 align:start position:0%
then I'll I'll go right to you so you're
 
01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
saying basically to leave that part open
 
01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:50.340 align:start position:0%
maybe have an investigation maybe not
 
01:42:54.290 --> 01:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
but basically provide that Latitude
 
01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
but I think the way it's being
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
interpreted right now by the division
 
01:43:00.169 --> 01:43:00.179 align:start position:0%
you have to have a full investigation in
 
01:43:03.169 --> 01:43:03.179 align:start position:0%
order to find probable cause and I think
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
that's the issue is I don't think you
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
need a full investigation to have
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
problem to find probable cause and what
 
01:43:13.850 --> 01:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
you're doing is basically adjudicating
 
01:43:16.010 --> 01:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
the whole case and having investigator
 
01:43:18.770 --> 01:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
adjudicate the case basically act as a
 
01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:19.990 align:start position:0%
adjudicate the case basically act as a
judge

01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
judge
 
01:43:22.189 --> 01:43:22.199 align:start position:0%
adjudicate the case
 
01:43:24.890 --> 01:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
and then give it to a commissioner to
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
make a finding a probable cause but
 
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
they're basically finding yeah
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's true or isn't true is is basically
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
their ruling
 
01:43:35.570 --> 01:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
representative wolper
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Mr chairman I
 
01:43:39.649 --> 01:43:39.659 align:start position:0%
think we have a problem here
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
and the problem is in fact in the
 
01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.270 align:start position:0%
and the problem is in fact in the
statute

01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:43:48.050 --> 01:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
I just want to read a couple sentences
 
01:43:50.330 --> 01:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:43:52.850 --> 01:43:52.860 align:start position:0%
which of these after the filing of any
 
01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:00.590 --> 01:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
one of the Commissioners designated by
 
01:44:02.570 --> 01:44:02.580 align:start position:0%

01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:04.380 align:start position:0%

01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
during the course of the investigation
 
01:44:13.609 --> 01:44:13.619 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:15.719 align:start position:0%
shall encourage the parties to resolve
 
01:44:17.810 --> 01:44:17.820 align:start position:0%

negotiations
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
and in such Commission
 
01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:24.709 align:start position:0%
and in such Commission
ER

01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
ER
 
01:44:27.950 --> 01:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
shall determine as such invest after
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
after such investigation that probable
 
01:44:35.090 --> 01:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:37.729 --> 01:44:37.739 align:start position:0%
for crediting the allegations of the
 
01:44:37.739 --> 01:44:39.770 align:start position:0%
for crediting the allegations of the
complainant

01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
complainant
 
01:44:41.810 --> 01:44:41.820 align:start position:0%
the commissioner shall immediately
 
01:44:44.649 --> 01:44:44.659 align:start position:0%
Endeavor to eliminate the unlawful
 
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
discriminatory practice
 
01:44:52.010 --> 01:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:55.729 --> 01:44:55.739 align:start position:0%
and the what this is saying to me
 
01:44:59.810 --> 01:44:59.820 align:start position:0%
is what does the human the reason we're
 
01:45:03.709 --> 01:45:03.719 align:start position:0%
getting the kinds of reports that were
 
01:45:06.430 --> 01:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned here which attorney
 
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
executive director Malachi says it's not
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
what we're doing now is because that's
 
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
what the statute calls for
 
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
this is in fact
 
01:45:17.090 --> 01:45:17.100 align:start position:0%
if if
 
01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
after such investigation the finding a
 
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
probable cause exists the commissioner
 
01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
shall immediately Endeavor to eliminate
 
01:45:31.370 --> 01:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:33.649 --> 01:45:33.659 align:start position:0%
you know you know where that is it's an
 
01:45:33.659 --> 01:45:34.810 align:start position:0%
you know you know where that is it's an
RSA

01:45:34.810 --> 01:45:34.820 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
01:45:39.410 --> 01:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
354a colon 21 Roman 2A and if you have
 
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
the same copy I do it's about the fifth
 
01:45:42.890 --> 01:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
line down begins with the word
 
01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:45.050 align:start position:0%
line down begins with the word

01:45:45.050 --> 01:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
determined
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
but that whole thing that I started is
 
01:45:50.149 --> 01:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
354 Roman 2A
 
01:45:52.370 --> 01:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
after following complaints it's all one
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
sentence and the commissioner has
 
01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:55.390 align:start position:0%
sentence and the commissioner has
already

01:45:55.390 --> 01:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
immediately to Endeavor to eliminate the
 
01:46:04.189 --> 01:46:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:06.109 --> 01:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
and that's as far as it goes that's what
 
01:46:09.290 --> 01:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
that's the whole investigatory part of
 
01:46:11.810 --> 01:46:11.820 align:start position:0%
this statute
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:49.070 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:52.669 --> 01:46:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:56.930 --> 01:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
had the problem and then
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
to take steps necessary which would have
 
01:47:04.129 --> 01:47:04.139 align:start position:0%
required a decision that
 
01:47:06.850 --> 01:47:06.860 align:start position:0%
yes there's a problem here
 
01:47:09.169 --> 01:47:09.179 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem to me to be any
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
relationship between that language
 
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
and what would that happen
 
01:47:16.669 --> 01:47:16.679 align:start position:0%
well and that could be right because it
 
01:47:19.250 --> 01:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
seems to me this just says the commit
 
01:47:20.450 --> 01:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
and file complaint and have an
 
01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
investigation and whatever is decided
 
01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
and I totally agree when with the report
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
there's equivalent of summary judgment
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
or as and this is talking about one
 
01:47:31.370 --> 01:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
commissioner there's no such thing as a
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:38.810 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:47:38.810 --> 01:47:38.820 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:47:43.129 --> 01:47:43.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:43.139 --> 01:47:52.010 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:47:52.010 --> 01:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:47:55.550 --> 01:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
so it's totally understandable to me
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
that the investigators would be doing
 
01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
all the work
 
01:48:01.430 --> 01:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
to make
 
01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:03.050 align:start position:0%
to make
a case

01:48:03.050 --> 01:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
a case
 
01:48:04.790 --> 01:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
and getting rubber stamped by the
 
01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:06.709 align:start position:0%
and getting rubber stamped by the
commissioner

01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:06.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:40.010 --> 01:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
there's no Hearing in there there is no
 
01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:42.470 align:start position:0%
there's no Hearing in there there is no
hearing

01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:48:42.480 --> 01:49:05.229 align:start position:0%
hearing
foreign

01:49:05.229 --> 01:49:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:10.970 --> 01:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
commissioner showing her issue written
 
01:49:12.890 --> 01:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
notice blah blah blah
 
01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
answer charges and to three members of
 
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
the commission and then you have it here
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
but but this statute says you do an
 
01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
investigation and then and the
 
01:49:27.709 --> 01:49:27.719 align:start position:0%
commission an a commissioner
 
01:49:31.010 --> 01:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
makes a determination and is immediately
 
01:49:35.810 --> 01:49:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:37.790 --> 01:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
immediately Endeavor to eliminate the
 
01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
unlawful practice
 
01:49:43.250 --> 01:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
and that's where this is breaking down
 
01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:45.310 align:start position:0%
and that's where this is breaking down
huh

01:49:45.310 --> 01:49:45.320 align:start position:0%
huh
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
well what but think about it the intent
 
01:49:51.530 --> 01:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
is not that
 
01:49:53.270 --> 01:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in makes a complaint
 
01:49:55.790 --> 01:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
there's an investigation there's a
 
01:49:57.770 --> 01:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
finding a probable cause and then
 
01:49:59.629 --> 01:49:59.639 align:start position:0%
there's a hearing no
 
01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
that is not what this says
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
it says they make a complaint there's an
 
01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:06.950 align:start position:0%
it says they make a complaint there's an
investigation

01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
and if there's probable cause
 
01:50:12.830 --> 01:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
the commission is shall immediately
 
01:50:14.689 --> 01:50:14.699 align:start position:0%
Endeavor to eliminate the unlawful
 
01:50:14.699 --> 01:50:16.370 align:start position:0%
Endeavor to eliminate the unlawful
practice

01:50:16.370 --> 01:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:50:18.910 --> 01:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
so if we
 
01:50:22.669 --> 01:50:22.679 align:start position:0%
if that fails
 
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
then there's another opportunity
 
01:50:28.430 --> 01:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
for a hearing before the whole
 
01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:30.530 align:start position:0%
for a hearing before the whole
Commission

01:50:30.530 --> 01:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:48.590 --> 01:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
I thought it was two years so maybe
 
01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
maybe they're thinking
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
that oh yeah at the end of that section
 
01:50:56.880 --> 01:50:58.970 align:start position:0%
that oh yeah at the end of that section
so

01:50:58.970 --> 01:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:01.790 --> 01:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
any complaint file pursuance can be
 
01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
removed after 180 days oh four yeah yeah
 
01:51:06.169 --> 01:51:06.179 align:start position:0%
and administrative section of the
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
commission tell me exactly the position
 
01:51:10.189 --> 01:51:10.199 align:start position:0%
brush up close each case or commits
 
01:51:12.590 --> 01:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
adjudicated proceedings on Seth case
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:20.930 --> 01:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
so close
 
01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:25.370 align:start position:0%
so close
if

01:51:25.370 --> 01:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:29.209 --> 01:51:29.219 align:start position:0%
so if we were to look at some of the
 
01:51:30.890 --> 01:51:30.900 align:start position:0%
language you were talking about with
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
respect to probable cause representative
 
01:51:32.639 --> 01:51:33.410 align:start position:0%
respect to probable cause representative
Accord

01:51:33.410 --> 01:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
Accord
 
01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
that would
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
based on representative Walker's comment
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
create a conflict right there chance to
 
01:51:43.250 --> 01:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
change the statue so you have to get
 
01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:44.870 align:start position:0%
change the statue so you have to get
into

01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:47.270 align:start position:0%
into
um

01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
so I just you know fool the committee do
 
01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
we think that we
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
really want to get into that's that's a
 
01:51:57.229 --> 01:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff to get into that we want to
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:02.689 --> 01:52:02.699 align:start position:0%
if we have to really
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:09.290 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:52:09.290 --> 01:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative I'm thinking I'm just
 
01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
listening to what you're saying and you
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
thought well do we want to get into that
 
01:52:17.270 --> 01:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
we talked about a possible performance
 
01:52:20.990 --> 01:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
audit so wouldn't it make sense to if in
 
01:52:22.729 --> 01:52:22.739 align:start position:0%
fact there is going to be a performance
 
01:52:24.590 --> 01:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
audit to write any
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
um statute after that
 
01:52:29.629 --> 01:52:29.639 align:start position:0%
I mean I I think there are some simple
 
01:52:31.729 --> 01:52:31.739 align:start position:0%
things you know that we can do
 
01:52:33.950 --> 01:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
but I agree with you get getting into
 
01:52:37.790 --> 01:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
some heavy meat and potatoes like this
 
01:52:40.430 --> 01:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
um it's going to require some thought
 
01:52:44.209 --> 01:52:44.219 align:start position:0%
um some interactive dialogue to just go
 
01:52:46.609 --> 01:52:46.619 align:start position:0%
in and well I well I you know understand
 
01:52:48.530 --> 01:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
and respect your comments it's it's
 
01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
going to take some thinking and uh so I
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
even though the performance audit if
 
01:52:56.510 --> 01:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
we're lucky enough to get it
 
01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:57.530 align:start position:0%
we're lucky enough to get it
um

01:52:57.530 --> 01:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:01.669 --> 01:53:01.679 align:start position:0%
there's there's a a a length to that I I
 
01:53:03.290 --> 01:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
think the end product would be better
 
01:53:05.390 --> 01:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
than if just the folks on the
 
01:53:06.830 --> 01:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee were to go into it that's
 
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:14.510 --> 01:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
I no I I concur because as I the more I
 
01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
think about this the more I think this
 
01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
is meant to be a non-judicial procedure
 
01:53:24.410 --> 01:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
or is this just an investigation and
 
01:53:26.810 --> 01:53:26.820 align:start position:0%
if there's reason to believe that the
 
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
Discrimination has actually occurred
 
01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
reason to believe probable cause
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
then there's a there's effort to um
 
01:53:40.010 --> 01:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
mitigate the circumstances
 
01:53:42.890 --> 01:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
to remove the discriminatory practice
 
01:53:45.890 --> 01:53:45.900 align:start position:0%
or correct whichever is
 
01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
but see we're not getting to that point
 
01:53:53.810 --> 01:53:53.820 align:start position:0%
at all
 
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
until we go through this
 
01:53:57.470 --> 01:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
very whole long thing and look for
 
01:53:59.330 --> 01:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
hearings and then this and that's why we
 
01:54:01.850 --> 01:54:01.860 align:start position:0%
have develop our removal
 
01:54:04.850 --> 01:54:04.860 align:start position:0%
right because at the point in the
 
01:54:08.570 --> 01:54:08.580 align:start position:0%
statute where probable cause is
 
01:54:08.580 --> 01:54:10.310 align:start position:0%
statute where probable cause is
determined

01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
determined
 
01:54:12.590 --> 01:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
the commission is supposed to be taking
 
01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:14.689 align:start position:0%
the commission is supposed to be taking
action

01:54:14.689 --> 01:54:14.699 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:54:14.699 --> 01:54:17.209 align:start position:0%
action
immediately

01:54:17.209 --> 01:54:17.219 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
01:54:17.219 --> 01:54:19.490 align:start position:0%
immediately
right

01:54:19.490 --> 01:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:54:22.669 --> 01:54:22.679 align:start position:0%
so allowing removal at that point is to
 
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
totally throw it the role of the
 
01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:28.790 align:start position:0%
totally throw it the role of the
commission

01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:30.590 --> 01:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
and I think that that part we're all
 
01:54:33.169 --> 01:54:33.179 align:start position:0%
we're all okay on but I think you know
 
01:54:35.450 --> 01:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
in in light of that
 
01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:36.770 align:start position:0%
in in light of that
I'm

01:54:36.770 --> 01:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
I would I would even leave the probable
 
01:54:43.370 --> 01:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:43.380 --> 01:54:44.629 align:start position:0%
 
I think

01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:54:47.450 --> 01:54:47.460 align:start position:0%
broadly speaking it's it's adequate
 
01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:51.060 align:start position:0%
maybe we can talk about how it's applied
 
01:54:54.050 --> 01:54:54.060 align:start position:0%
um but I I just don't want to create
 
01:54:56.930 --> 01:54:56.940 align:start position:0%
conflict within the statute that we
 
01:54:58.609 --> 01:54:58.619 align:start position:0%
really haven't taken the time to look
 
01:54:58.619 --> 01:55:00.350 align:start position:0%
really haven't taken the time to look
into

01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:55:02.689 --> 01:55:02.699 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
on to representative Smith's other point
 
01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
which is gel car
 
01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:10.129 align:start position:0%
which is gel car
um

01:55:10.129 --> 01:55:10.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:10.139 --> 01:55:12.590 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:55:12.590 --> 01:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:13.970 --> 01:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
I just want to follow up on
 
01:55:15.770 --> 01:55:15.780 align:start position:0%
representative wolper's comment a little
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
bit about maybe writing that into the
 
01:55:21.229 --> 01:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
statute that we would you know ask for a
 
01:55:23.330 --> 01:55:23.340 align:start position:0%
commission or a formal convening of gel
 
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
car to do that
 
01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:26.149 align:start position:0%
car to do that
um

01:55:26.149 --> 01:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
I I understand your comment is that
 
01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:32.940 align:start position:0%
really necessary but I I think having
 
01:55:34.729 --> 01:55:34.739 align:start position:0%
something that kind of forces the hand
 
01:55:38.290 --> 01:55:38.300 align:start position:0%
would be good
 
01:55:41.390 --> 01:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
should we should we be putting that
 
01:55:44.570 --> 01:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
into the language of the stat of of
 
01:55:46.850 --> 01:55:46.860 align:start position:0%
whatever we come out of here with
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
well I I don't think that's the way to
 
01:55:55.250 --> 01:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
handle that I think the way to handle it
 
01:55:58.129 --> 01:55:58.139 align:start position:0%
is in the report that we make
 
01:56:02.750 --> 01:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
um uh as to the bill I mean and that
 
01:56:06.050 --> 01:56:06.060 align:start position:0%
would then be on record
 
01:56:09.590 --> 01:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
um and we then are free to
 
01:56:12.290 --> 01:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
uh for someone to talk to the governor
 
01:56:16.010 --> 01:56:16.020 align:start position:0%
about about the funding and we're also
 
01:56:19.729 --> 01:56:19.739 align:start position:0%
free for someone to talk to the newly
 
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
formed gel car to say
 
01:56:25.010 --> 01:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
this is something that needs to be done
 
01:56:27.709 --> 01:56:27.719 align:start position:0%
and we have it in and we say here's the
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
report and we're showing you that I
 
01:56:33.470 --> 01:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:36.050 --> 01:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
oh representative walpark I agree with
 
01:56:38.209 --> 01:56:38.219 align:start position:0%
representative Smith if we write a
 
01:56:40.330 --> 01:56:40.340 align:start position:0%
report along the lines that we just
 
01:56:43.310 --> 01:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
delineated right that we we think we
 
01:56:45.410 --> 01:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
should do the remove the removal from
 
01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:48.109 align:start position:0%
should do the remove the removal from
296

01:56:48.109 --> 01:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
296
 
01:56:49.850 --> 01:56:49.860 align:start position:0%
but we really think what needs to happen
 
01:56:52.370 --> 01:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
is the rules need to be updated
 
01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:53.750 align:start position:0%
is the rules need to be updated
then

01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
everybody in the world including
 
01:56:58.970 --> 01:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
director Malachi can take that
 
01:57:04.250 --> 01:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:06.830 --> 01:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
so well rather than put that
 
01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
in the legislation just put it in the
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
okay so representative Smith you also
 
01:57:32.270 --> 01:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
talked about funding
 
01:57:35.570 --> 01:57:35.580 align:start position:0%
um are there thoughts from anybody about
 
01:57:38.030 --> 01:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
requests for funding in the report or or
 
01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:40.310 align:start position:0%
requests for funding in the report or or
comments

01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:42.410 align:start position:0%
comments
oh

01:57:42.410 --> 01:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:56.689 --> 01:57:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:00.290 --> 01:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
or we could say in the report that based
 
01:58:02.089 --> 01:58:02.099 align:start position:0%
on the information the director has
 
01:58:07.070 --> 01:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
given us we support our request
 
01:58:13.370 --> 01:58:13.380 align:start position:0%
for additional funds uh and uh in order
 
01:58:16.669 --> 01:58:16.679 align:start position:0%
for the agency to be able to carry out
 
01:58:18.490 --> 01:58:18.500 align:start position:0%
its statue
 
01:58:23.589 --> 01:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.490 --> 01:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
role but uh and then meanwhile
 
01:58:29.930 --> 01:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
we need
 
01:58:29.940 --> 01:58:34.390 align:start position:0%
we need
um

01:58:34.390 --> 01:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
have you had your uh
 
01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:42.719 align:start position:0%
your hearing yet for uh house
 
01:58:47.570 --> 01:58:47.580 align:start position:0%
this is the on the governor's request
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
budget yeah
 
01:58:50.639 --> 01:58:57.350 align:start position:0%
budget yeah
okay

01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:59.810 --> 01:58:59.820 align:start position:0%
so you think I think you could put in
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
there that uh
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
with uh in the current process
 
01:59:10.430 --> 01:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
the resources are inadequate
 
01:59:13.970 --> 01:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
to meet reasonable time frames for a
 
01:59:17.030 --> 01:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
resolution of cases
 
01:59:19.850 --> 01:59:19.860 align:start position:0%
as required by Statute
 
01:59:22.129 --> 01:59:22.139 align:start position:0%
and that additional resources are
 
01:59:22.139 --> 01:59:41.470 align:start position:0%
and that additional resources are
required

01:59:41.470 --> 01:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:48.890 --> 01:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
we'll give representative Oprah a minute
 
02:00:05.689 --> 02:00:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:18.109 --> 02:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:21.109 --> 02:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
yeah so quick review I have five items
 
02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
maybe good for cars
 
02:00:26.089 --> 02:00:26.099 align:start position:0%
maybe four
 
02:00:29.930 --> 02:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
to be included in our report
 
02:00:34.970 --> 02:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
so the inaction of SB 296 report
 
02:00:34.980 --> 02:00:37.070 align:start position:0%
so the inaction of SB 296 report
language

02:00:37.070 --> 02:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:00:41.870 --> 02:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:44.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:00:44.450 --> 02:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:50.030 --> 02:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
and then you get to resources uh what I
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
had was resources above the normal
 
02:00:58.070 --> 02:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
operational level are required to
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
address the backlog of cases
 
02:01:04.370 --> 02:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
and current processes require additional
 
02:01:13.370 --> 02:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:21.649 --> 02:01:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:23.149 --> 02:01:23.159 align:start position:0%
do it
 
02:01:23.159 --> 02:01:24.310 align:start position:0%
do it
yeah

02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:01:27.530 --> 02:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
no I I agree you you want to you want to
 
02:01:29.209 --> 02:01:29.219 align:start position:0%
bring some stability over to the
 
02:01:32.450 --> 02:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
commission that's I think vital
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
um and so it goes beyond the backlog
 
02:01:37.609 --> 02:01:37.619 align:start position:0%
well it does yeah
 
02:01:40.490 --> 02:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
but good
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
deal is to prevent the agency from
 
02:01:45.890 --> 02:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
becoming a training agency because from
 
02:01:45.900 --> 02:01:46.910 align:start position:0%
becoming a training agency because from
what

02:01:46.910 --> 02:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:01:49.250 --> 02:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
um director Malachi said is that people
 
02:01:51.530 --> 02:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
come and they leave they leave to go to
 
02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
you know more money or whatever so
 
02:01:58.850 --> 02:01:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:03.709 --> 02:02:03.719 align:start position:0%
okay so I mean I those uh those four
 
02:02:06.890 --> 02:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
items dovetail in with my thoughts
 
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
everybody else agree
 
02:02:12.050 --> 02:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
okay so what we'll do then is
 
02:02:14.570 --> 02:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
um I think from a statutory perspective
 
02:02:16.669 --> 02:02:16.679 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of
 
02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
the bill is 296. we're good the rest of
 
02:02:21.649 --> 02:02:21.659 align:start position:0%
it will go into the report
 
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
um we'll work to get something together
 
02:02:26.410 --> 02:02:26.420 align:start position:0%
by the time that representative Gordon
 
02:02:28.850 --> 02:02:28.860 align:start position:0%
convenes the committee as a whole and
 
02:02:31.490 --> 02:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
will present that to the whole committee
 
02:02:35.810 --> 02:02:35.820 align:start position:0%
so does anybody have any other thoughts
 
02:02:38.450 --> 02:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
um representative wolper so uh Mr
 
02:02:39.649 --> 02:02:39.659 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah
 
02:02:42.229 --> 02:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
the concern the only concern that I
 
02:02:44.570 --> 02:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
would have is if someone has to actually
 
02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
write the report
 
02:02:49.850 --> 02:02:49.860 align:start position:0%
and typically that would be go to all of
 
02:02:52.070 --> 02:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
us to review before we submitted to the
 
02:02:53.930 --> 02:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
full committee
 
02:02:57.050 --> 02:02:57.060 align:start position:0%
so I would suggest that we decide uh
 
02:02:58.609 --> 02:02:58.619 align:start position:0%
who's going to write it
 
02:03:00.410 --> 02:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
that would be useful
 
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:06.490 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:03:06.490 --> 02:03:06.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:12.169 --> 02:03:12.179 align:start position:0%
we plan to meet uh maybe just before
 
02:03:15.410 --> 02:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
the meeting for the whole committee
 
02:03:21.050 --> 02:03:21.060 align:start position:0%
to redo it because we can't discuss it
 
02:03:22.609 --> 02:03:22.619 align:start position:0%
any other way without having another
 
02:03:22.619 --> 02:03:24.890 align:start position:0%
any other way without having another
meeting

02:03:24.890 --> 02:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
so we yeah so once uh
 
02:03:39.229 --> 02:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
I had to look at my calendar
 
02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
um and I'll get back to representative
 
02:03:43.850 --> 02:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
Gordon on that and then he'll kind of
 
02:03:45.709 --> 02:03:45.719 align:start position:0%
pull the rest of the committee
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
understand what their scheduling is like
 
02:03:50.330 --> 02:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
we'll all get together when we know that
 
02:04:15.530 --> 02:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:19.010 --> 02:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
right October 19th
 
02:04:22.490 --> 02:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
so when that comes out we'll we'll
 
02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
schedule something then
 
02:04:27.830 --> 02:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
to get to get the five of us together
 
02:04:29.930 --> 02:04:29.940 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman I would suggest that we
 
02:04:29.940 --> 02:04:31.310 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman I would suggest that we
meet

02:04:31.310 --> 02:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
meet
 
02:04:34.030 --> 02:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
for lunch
 
02:04:36.169 --> 02:04:36.179 align:start position:0%
no we can't do it has to be a public
 
02:04:37.850 --> 02:04:37.860 align:start position:0%
meeting right
 
02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
yeah yes so like half an hour before
 
02:04:42.589 --> 02:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
whatever the
 
02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
schedule time for the regular full
 
02:04:58.250 --> 02:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:02.990 --> 02:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:04.850 --> 02:05:04.860 align:start position:0%
it's all right well what what's what's
 
02:05:06.589 --> 02:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
the date on that
 
02:05:10.810 --> 02:05:10.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:14.570 --> 02:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
subject to me checking like uh I worked
 
02:05:17.089 --> 02:05:17.099 align:start position:0%
for him enough the other way around so
 
02:05:17.099 --> 02:05:19.430 align:start position:0%
for him enough the other way around so
um

02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:26.990 --> 02:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:29.089 --> 02:05:29.099 align:start position:0%
I said no wrong answer
 
02:05:32.450 --> 02:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
um okay uh so that's fine so
 
02:05:34.430 --> 02:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
but in terms of
 
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
um who is going to write the report I
 
02:05:39.050 --> 02:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
was thinking to to be putting something
 
02:05:41.689 --> 02:05:41.699 align:start position:0%
together unless you're volunteering
 
02:05:41.699 --> 02:05:43.609 align:start position:0%
together unless you're volunteering
what

02:05:43.609 --> 02:05:43.619 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:05:46.010 --> 02:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to let you have it all right
 
02:05:50.030 --> 02:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
so um yeah so I'll I'll uh I'll put
 
02:05:51.290 --> 02:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
something together I've never written
 
02:05:53.030 --> 02:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
one before but I'll figure it out and
 
02:05:55.550 --> 02:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
then we'll get us all together and
 
02:05:57.050 --> 02:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
um I can
 
02:05:59.149 --> 02:05:59.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I I definitely am going to be
 
02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%
walking to the back of the room when
 
02:06:03.770 --> 02:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
this is done uh and uh although she's
 
02:06:06.109 --> 02:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
grimacing a bit so we'll see
 
02:06:13.070 --> 02:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:15.169 --> 02:06:15.179 align:start position:0%
before the night before I will do that
 
02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:18.239 align:start position:0%

02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
director Malachi says a lot to unpack
 
02:06:29.149 --> 02:06:29.159 align:start position:0%
and uh certainly a lot of learning for
 
02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
me and everybody has been very patient
