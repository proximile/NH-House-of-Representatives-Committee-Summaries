committee need to
 
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
know and I guess we can get started
 
00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
started on that I don't know if my um
 
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
ranking chair would like to have a few
 
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
words with you um welcome everyone U I
 
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 align:start position:0%

working with everyone uh this term and
 
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh I think that probably what I I I I
 
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
believe that the what we're going to be
 
00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 align:start position:0%
doing is going through the the committee
 
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
procedures and I'm uh happy to let uh
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
representative Aon take the lead on that
 
00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
and I will probably chip in occasionally
 
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
if uh I want to emphasize something uh
 
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
but um I just want to um one thing I
 
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize at the outset is that
 
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
representative Aon and I really work
 
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
closely together on committee leadership
 
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
we are both really dedicated to the idea
 
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
that this is a nonpartisan committee and
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh that's a long-standing tradition
 
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
since well before I started in 200 13 uh
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
so um let's uh I hope we can continue in
 
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
that spirit thank you my vice chair

representative Bixby uh had to say I've
 
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
been serving on this committee since
 
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 align:start position:0%

together to get out good
 
00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
legislation and when we agree to
 
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
disagree it's
 
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 align:start position:0%

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
representative Peter Bixby I'm from do
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
and uh I was uh first elected in 2012
 
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
and uh I was really wanted to be on this
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
committee because I do a lot of
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
Homestead gardening and orcharding and
 
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
I'm a member of the main organic farmers
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
and gardeners Association and New
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on nor Northeast Northeast um
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.269 align:start position:0%
Northeast organic farmers or Association
um

00:12:36.269 --> 00:12:36.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
and unpacking all the one one sometimes
 
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
gets overwhelmed by unpacking all the
 
00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
acronyms so um uh so I've been for quite
 
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
a while I've been um providing most of
 
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
the produce uh for my family from our
 
00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
Gardens and Orchard uh and we have
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
laying hands on um nothing larger than
 
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
that because I'm not zoned for it um and
 
00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:08.839 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that uh kind of
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
surprised me when I was on the commit
 
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
when I joined the committee was that and
 
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
I was expecting to be mostly about
 
00:13:17.189 --> 00:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
agriculture and some environmental stuff
 
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden we were discussing
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
all of these animal cruelty
 
00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:25.399 align:start position:0%
bills and that sort of says wow where
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
did this come from but uh so there there
 
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
will be topics that you might not
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily expect when you um uh when
 
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
you sign up for an Agriculture and
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
environment committee but there they are
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
and uh you'll learn about them very
 
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
quickly so uh uh I guess that's um there
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
we'll learn more about each other as we
 
00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:48.519 align:start position:0%
go on but that's kind of the nutshell
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:53.639 align:start position:0%

um
um

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
but I also have well my sons have a farm
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
um it started out as ours we were into
 
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
we did hydroponic uh gardening we did
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
about 5 Acres of
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
Hydroponics and uh it was quite an
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
experience my son has chosen not to do
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
Hydroponics he wants to grow in soil so
 
00:16:54.309 --> 00:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
he's gone into specialty berries
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
specifically hasc caps and kiwi
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
berries um and and they take about three
 
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
uh to four years uh to really start
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
producing commercially but he spent
 
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
about five years getting this the land
 
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:10.039 align:start position:0%
ready for that so he is actually taking
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
over our farm but um and obviously uh
 
00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:14.829 align:start position:0%
over our farm but um and obviously uh
food

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:14.839 align:start position:0%
food
 
00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
security uh for the State of New
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the population is near and
 
00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:22.039 align:start position:0%
dear to my heart uh as you'll learn we
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
can only feed about 6% of our population
 
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
with what we actually grow currently um
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
which is a scary thought when we think
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
about that our grocery stores on 18
 
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.120 align:start position:0%

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
working in the US and over in Eastern
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
Europe where there solid waste issues
 
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
were a disaster after they drove out the
 
00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:23.559 align:start position:0%
Russians um and I'm very engaged and inv
 
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
involved in agriculture too at a local
 
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
level I came here in 1978 to Homestead
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh we've done sugaring um we have a
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
small Vineyard and a winery that we make
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
wine from and uh live in 20 acres in the
 
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
back Hills of alad so very pleased to be
 
00:18:41.549 --> 00:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
here and I hope I could help it looks
 
00:18:46.149 --> 00:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
like a a wonderful uh group thank you
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%

morning uh good morning all uh
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative Scully this is actually
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
my second term not consecutive I was up
 
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
here in 17 and 18 and I'm back again I
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
had HED to Ser in the security my first
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
go around it didn't work out that way um
 
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
I felt my background would be useful to
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
um the Hampshire having done hazardous
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
weight cleanups investigations and
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
cleanups for about 40 years so I'm happy
 
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
I'm here now because I think I can help
 
00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
with um my experience and expertise in
 
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
terms of trying to craft legislation
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
that will um make the hampture better
 
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
for all of us I also think that um food
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
energy and probably our medicines are
 
00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
hugely important that we're able to be
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient here in the United

00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%

representative

00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
siketus good morning is it on yes okay I
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm from Nashville award s um if
 
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with nashwa it is my
 
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
wward starts at um East Hollis Street
 
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
and it goes all the way down to the
 
00:22:27.149 --> 00:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
state line um the reason that I'm saying
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
that is because
 
00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
I don't know four years ago this is my
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
fifth term maybe four years ago we
 
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
started to get a lot of letters about
 
00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.669 align:start position:0%
started to get a lot of letters about
Forest

00:22:38.669 --> 00:22:38.679 align:start position:0%
Forest
 
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
Lake and
 
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
um so I I drove and I have a spinal cord
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
injury high in my neck and um my husband
 
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
had recently died but I didn't think I
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
could make it but I drove all the way up
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
to Fourth Lake and it was frozen and it
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
was covered with snow and we had a
 
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
constituent meeting in the middle of
 
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
force Lake before the Committee hearing
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm rabid about Forest Lake and um
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
I've I've met the people up there I've
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
worked hard with them and um I'm glad
 
00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:19.559 align:start position:0%
that you're here from Whitefield because
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
I love Whitefield and and I'm so glad
 
00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:24.919 align:start position:0%
that I got my eyes on it and I'm
 
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
actually thrilled beyond belief that the
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
governor said in her inaugural address
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
that there was not going to be a
 
00:23:36.909 --> 00:23:36.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
Lake we have a problem in New
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because we have lack
 
00:23:46.669 --> 00:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
regulations environmental
 
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
regulations and so it's people's
 
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
business models to get trash from other
 
00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
states and bring it here and um
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
that sends me around the bend it's not a
 
00:24:03.789 --> 00:24:03.799 align:start position:0%
free enterprise thing as far as I'm
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
concerned and
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
so I just feel like the other thing that
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
bothers me a lot is creep creep of the
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
housing as more and more housing needs
 
00:24:18.909 --> 00:24:18.919 align:start position:0%
to get built people are going to push
 
00:24:21.789 --> 00:24:21.799 align:start position:0%
further and further and it's going to be
 
00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to be uh Boston's Northern
 
00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
suburbs and what's going to happen is
 
00:24:30.389 --> 00:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
they're going to want to put limits on
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
Family Farms in terms of noise in terms
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
of a lot of things they're going to go
 
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
out there they're going to have a MC
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
Mansion built right next to a working
 
00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%
farm and then they're going to get upset
 
00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
about the noise and so those are the
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
things I think that Co taught us that
 
00:24:50.159 --> 00:24:51.669 align:start position:0%
things I think that Co taught us that
the

00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559 align:start position:0%
um Supply chains are easily broken and
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
we need to get the Farms pumping out
 
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
food I believe firmly in farm to table
 
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
and in Homestead
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
um that people with homestead should be
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
able to with minimal regulation sell
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
their products so those are the things
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:25:22.269 --> 00:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
um that mean a lot to me by uh trade I I
 
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:26.120 align:start position:0%
I'm a registered nurse and from the time
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
I was six years old I wanted to to be a
 
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
burn nurse and I became a burn nurse and
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
in charge of the burn unit at the brigam
 
00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:38.200 align:start position:0%
for many many many years and and then I
 
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
got my spinal cord injury and I can't
 
00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.389 align:start position:0%
got my spinal cord injury and I can't
work

00:25:41.389 --> 00:25:41.399 align:start position:0%

morning good morning thank you madam
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
chair and if you want to close those
 
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
doors you can full disclosure I have no
 
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
experience in agriculture or
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
Environmental Studies um I'm a 35-year
 
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
retired occupational therapist so I
 
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
don't know if that qualifies me for
 
00:26:21.269 --> 00:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
anything however I did um uh this is my
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
first term as a representative in Tilton
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
Bel now District 8 but I am um a second
 
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
non-consecutive term representative
 
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
originally from Manchester um I grew up
 
00:26:33.549 --> 00:26:33.559 align:start position:0%
right outside of Logan Airport if you
 
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
can't tell so I think that kind of
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
qualifies me for environmental things I
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
grew up there when the airport was
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
expanding and a lot of the environmental
 
00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
groups came in and said no you have to
 
00:26:47.389 --> 00:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
stop this so I saw a lot of things I saw
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
when the Jets took off or especially
 
00:26:51.789 --> 00:26:51.799 align:start position:0%
when they landed they would um they
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
would dump their jet fuel into the
 
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
harbor um before they landed because
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
that was a safety protocol back back
 
00:27:00.269 --> 00:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
then so I saw some environmental things
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
and I can appreciate anybody here who
 
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
blank slate and I can't wait to learn
 
00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:13.039 align:start position:0%
about the things that you all have been
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
on the election law committee which was
 
00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:20.120 align:start position:0%

and now living in Tilton I can see the
 
00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
true Majesty of the state and why it's
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
important that we work on these issues
 
00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
and keep New Hampshire pristine not only
 
00:27:33.149 --> 00:27:33.159 align:start position:0%
environmentally but make sure that
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
people have the opportunity to earn a
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
living on this land so um thank you for

00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
slate so you know throw it at me I'm
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
ham number seven and um I'm the building
 
00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
inspector in town um my background is a
 
00:27:58.440 --> 00:27:59.710 align:start position:0%
inspector in town um my background is a
former

00:27:59.710 --> 00:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
former
 
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:02.200 align:start position:0%
educator uh licensed a master
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
electrician and a contractor it goes on
 
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
forever the list is um pretty pretty
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
long so I won't blow you with that
 
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
anyways the reason I'm on this committee
 
00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
is because we also have a farm we um
 
00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
process and raise uh over a thousand
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
Birds a year not only for us but for
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
other people we're the only um we're the
 
00:28:20.669 --> 00:28:20.679 align:start position:0%
only Farm in Southern New Hampshire that
 
00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
does process birds for other people uh
 
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
we have a great following uh we sell to
 
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:27.799 align:start position:0%
not only restaurants but out of our
 
00:28:29.549 --> 00:28:29.559 align:start position:0%
store on our property and also at
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
farmers markets um there's a lot of
 
00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
regulations I think that need to be
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
changed um things that hinder uh farms
 
00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and it's certainly um
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's certainly achievable and I think
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
this community can do
 
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
it thank you thank you so much we have

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
sessions I will need to know whether uh
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%

getting substitutes for exec sessions
 
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
that is something that is done on a
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
partisan basis so uh if you're a
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
republican then that needs to go to to U
 
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron and she would make
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
that request of the speaker's office if
 
00:31:29.629 --> 00:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
that if you're a Democrat they would
 
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
that request you'd uh send that to me
 
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:35.240 align:start position:0%

Democratic office and they need the and
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
then the Democratic office needs to make
 
00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:43.240 align:start position:0%
the request uh for substitutes for for
 
00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:43.909 align:start position:0%

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:23.960 align:start position:0%

having laptops or Chromebooks or
 
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:28.400 align:start position:0%

testifying that you're not on your phone
 
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
texting somebody you're not on your
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
laptop looking up you know something on
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
Amazon that you please give the people
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
who are testifying who have given of
 
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
their day uh your full attention and I
 
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
think this committee is also pretty well
 
00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
known uh for the attention that we do
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
provide to the people who come and
 
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
testify before for us so please please
 
00:36:03.309 --> 00:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
make sure that you are affording them
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
the attention and the courtesy that you
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
would expect for yourself when you go to
 
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
testify in other committees
 
00:36:12.309 --> 00:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
representative gerana thank you madam I
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
just want to Second something the chair
 
00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
just said that we have people come up to
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
us after testifying I've seen it
 
00:36:21.069 --> 00:36:21.079 align:start position:0%
countless times and they're just in awe
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
of how much respect they got from the
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
committee and say this is so different
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
from testifying in front of other
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
committees and so so um you know I think
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's a great culture that's been
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
created in this committee and and people
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
will will let you know how much they
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely um
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
okay we have in our committee room which
 
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
is on on the other side you go out the
 
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:51.640 align:start position:0%
door and you hang a left here is a
 
00:36:54.309 --> 00:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
committee room and that's has uh
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
committee room drawers there's a file
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
cabinets with drawers in it you will at
 
00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:02.200 align:start position:0%
some point all be getting um a bill
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
folder once they get all the bills that
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
are coming to our committee photocopied
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
each one of us will get um a bill file
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
and you as far as I'm concerned you can
 
00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
keep that bill file here it's supposed
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
to stay here but some of us have binders
 
00:37:26.349 --> 00:37:26.359 align:start position:0%
and I keep my files of my uh of of the
 
00:37:26.359 --> 00:37:27.870 align:start position:0%
and I keep my files of my uh of of the
legislation

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
the bills in in my binder I take it home
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
with me um that's up to you I I don't
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
really mind it if you keep it here you
 
00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
don't keep it here we're all adults and
 
00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
responsible and I think we can figure
 
00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
that out um emergency procedures for
 
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
room um sure represent VI so so the
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
folder that um that the bills come in
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
needs to stay it should actually stay at
 
00:37:56.349 --> 00:37:56.359 align:start position:0%
your desk when you finish it when you
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
finish because that that gets that
 
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:00.280 align:start position:0%
folder gets reused by a committee
 
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
assistant to pass to provide more bills
 
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
each week until we're done with them um
 
00:38:09.309 --> 00:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
so uh you can take the bills out put
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
them in your drawer leave the folder at
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
your desk so that it can be collected by
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
the committee assistant and um and that
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the way it operates okay
 
00:38:19.079 --> 00:38:21.030 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the way it operates okay
thank

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
you so we have emergency procedures for
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
this committee room um and um if there's
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
any kind of fire alarm or anything we're
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
going to hear some sort of uh audible
 
00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
alarm and I would announce an emergency
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
may exist and that we would have to exit
 
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
the building uh when we exit the
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
building we would use the West staircase
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
and go to Green Street which is out that
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
way um they don't want us in the lob
 
00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:55.079 align:start position:0%
garage uh under no circumstances during
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
an emergency would we use the elevators
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
um there is the um the stairwell down
 
00:39:04.109 --> 00:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
that way down the hall there if we are
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
to shelter in place we would go to room
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
307 or 207 if we are downstairs those
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
are designated waiting areas to wait for
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
assistance for those who can't exit the
 
00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
building um and protective services
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
would be here to advise where to go uh
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
collection Point members are to evacuate
 
00:39:26.589 --> 00:39:26.599 align:start position:0%
to a determined place where the chair
 
00:39:28.829 --> 00:39:28.839 align:start position:0%
can take a head count and ensure all
 
00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:31.079 align:start position:0%
members have exited the building and I
 
00:39:34.349 --> 00:39:34.359 align:start position:0%
would suggest probably at the corner up
 
00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
here by where they're doing construction
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
on um the new garage that we would
 
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
gather at that at that
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
place um for building re-entry access to
 
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
the building would be authorized by the
 
00:39:52.349 --> 00:39:52.359 align:start position:0%
conquered fire department personnel and
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
communicated to Protective
 
00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
Services in case of a medical e
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
emergency we would call
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
911 um which internally would be
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
9911 and uh we would have to uh then
 
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
describe what happened the victim's name
 
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
and condition please nobody have a heart
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
attack thank you I'd appreciate it um
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
AED devices are located in the L Lobby
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
downstairs uh we have procedures to call
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
27122 so protective services is a aware
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
of the situation U we would not move the
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
victim but clear the area around the
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
victim and I I would suggest you read
 
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
over these um procedures the emergency
 
00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:40.839 align:start position:0%
procedures so that if God forbid
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
anything would happen that we are kind
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
of clear on what we're supposed to where
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to go what we're supposed
 
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.190 align:start position:0%

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.349 align:start position:0%
that though so I'll have to ask the
committee

00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
assistant so environment agriculture
 
00:42:22.109 --> 00:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
what are we doing here um according to
 
00:42:22.119 --> 00:42:23.109 align:start position:0%
what are we doing here um according to
rule

00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
rule
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
31g it shall be the duty of the
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
committee on environment and agriculture
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
to cons consider all matters concerning
 
00:42:30.549 --> 00:42:30.559 align:start position:0%
Agricultural and farm problems of the
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
state physical land use including
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
current use the various agricultural
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
organizations the protection of state's
 
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
environment from forms of pollution
 
00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
other than air or water which is
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
designated to another committee we deal
 
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
with waste management issues and such
 
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
other matters as may be referred to
 
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
it again I want to reiterate environment
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
agriculture has always been run as a
 
00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan committee and we expect it
 
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
to remain that way so we hope that you
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
will keep your R&amp;D at the door and when
 
00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
you come in here we're all going to work
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
together to solve problems for the State
 
00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire I think it's really
 
00:43:16.549 --> 00:43:16.559 align:start position:0%
important um I know that we we will have
 
00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
philosophical differences on how to
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
solve problems and that's okay we can
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
agree to disagree and be um agreeable
 
00:43:29.069 --> 00:43:29.079 align:start position:0%
about that um
 
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
worked so far and I hope it will
 
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
continue to work
 
00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
um for this bium the size of our
 
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
committee is 16 members we did have
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
20 um and the balance of uh of course I
 
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
just spoke about nonpartisanship but it
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
is nine Republicans and seven
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
Democrats um but we will we will work
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
together on these issues
 
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
um anybody have questions about that
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
because I find that's very very
 
00:44:08.109 --> 00:44:08.119 align:start position:0%
important representative minor actually
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry this may not be relevant but I
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
just wondering where is the mileage
 
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
kiosk in these buildings oh yeah uh
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
mileage kiosk in the lob is downstairs
 
00:44:20.829 --> 00:44:20.839 align:start position:0%
in there's one on each side and it's by
 
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
if you go by the um security desk y
 
00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.470 align:start position:0%
if you go by the um security desk y
there's

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
one on one side side of the building by
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
the women's bathroom and one on the
 
00:44:34.349 --> 00:44:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:38.119 align:start position:0%
yeah okay um I have laid out and worked
 
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby on our committee
 
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
seating we are sitting a mixed seating
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
which I'm I know other committees sit
 
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
Democrats on one side or holigans on the
 
00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
other we decided we didn't want to do
 
00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
that um and if anyone is unhappy with
 
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
their seat or wants to change please let
 
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
me know
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
no represent also like to uh note that
 
00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
we also when we designed the seating we
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
also tried to pair newer members with
 
00:45:10.549 --> 00:45:10.559 align:start position:0%
older members so that um so that you
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
should have someone who is more
 
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
you so you know they can lean over and
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
say well what was that motion what does
 
00:45:23.549 --> 00:45:23.559 align:start position:0%
that mean representative Scully uh
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
question Madam chair regarding the issue
 
00:45:28.829 --> 00:45:28.839 align:start position:0%
of pollution um are are we do we deal
 
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
with soil pollution yes okay I it's kind
 
00:45:33.549 --> 00:45:33.559 align:start position:0%
of weird because sometimes soil
 
00:45:35.549 --> 00:45:35.559 align:start position:0%
pollution can also result in water
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
pollution so have you dealt with issues
 
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
and how does that handle yes um well you
 
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
know uh
 
00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
the the the what the committee on uh
 
00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:53.839 align:start position:0%
resources they do um soil pollution as
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
well and water runoff so sometimes um
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
depending on what the speaker deci
 
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
decides we may get bills that they might
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
hear or they might get bills we might
 
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
hear but there's sort of a gray area in
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
there I don't know representative K you
 
00:46:14.109 --> 00:46:14.119 align:start position:0%
look like you want to say something
 
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um and a lot of
 
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
times some of those issues come down to
 
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh like one of the issues had to deal
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
with fertilizer run off into water so
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
because fertilizer is a a a what we are
 
00:46:31.549 --> 00:46:31.559 align:start position:0%
tasked with it's our purview here so it
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
depends on the topic in the actual bill
 
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
whether it comes to our committee or
 
00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.670 align:start position:0%
whether it comes to our committee or
another

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
committee okay represent vix so uh there
 
00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
are um there are a couple of levels of
 
00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
that one is that uh the the committee
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
the the way that bills get assigned to
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
the Committees is uh in in Practical
 
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
terms is done by the speaker's office
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
and uh they may choose to assign
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
something to our committee or to another
 
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
committee that doesn't seem to
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily make sense at first glance
 
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
and there are two possible answers to
 
00:47:11.069 --> 00:47:11.079 align:start position:0%
that one is that they have a huge number
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
of bills to assign and sometimes they
 
00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
make mistakes and if that happens we try
 
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
to catch it fairly early for instance
 
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:19.480 align:start position:0%
last term there was a bill that had to
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
do with solid waste permitting in
 
00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:23.839 align:start position:0%
municipalities but it had to do with
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
Municipal fees and I noticed this and I
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh said to repes representative eron you
 
00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
need to talk with Municipal and County
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
and get this vacated because this is not
 
00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
ours uh on the other hand sometimes
 
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
there are gray areas in terms of where
 
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
you know where it go where it fits in
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
terms of one committee's purview or
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
another and there's also uh they're also
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
matters of which parts of Statute are
 
00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:56.839 align:start position:0%
being changed so the parts of stat
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
statute that have to do with the
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture and with solid
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
waste and dees are really our purview uh
 
00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
there was a bill that we was initially
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
came to our committee last term and uh
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
we wanted to amend it in order to change
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
it to the way that something was being
 
00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:17.839 align:start position:0%
sold as opposed to the way it was being
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
disposed and we learned from the clerk
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
that uh well actually because it's
 
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:25.480 align:start position:0%
changing something in the in the in the
 
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
commer statutes we couldn't me we
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
couldn't do the amendment on that bill
 
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh so there are all sorts of things that
 
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
are you know eventually you learn about
 
00:48:38.349 --> 00:48:38.359 align:start position:0%
these things but um but the short the
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
short thing is that we mostly get things
 
00:48:45.549 --> 00:48:45.559 align:start position:0%
that are uh farming Solid Waste animals
 
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
and uh and food protection yep so our
 
00:48:52.589 --> 00:48:52.599 align:start position:0%
typical Bill topics will be solid waste
 
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
which includes recycling landfills
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
product of stewardship
 
00:49:01.069 --> 00:49:01.079 align:start position:0%
um a policy support and promotion
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
Federal food safety modernization act
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
Farm stands and Homestead food
 
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.670 align:start position:0%
Farm stands and Homestead food
operations

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
pesticides Animal Welfare both farm and
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
household and current use
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
issues early bills um I don't know which
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
of our 25 bills yet are called early
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
bills I will find that out later today
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
and so those bills need to be addressed
 
00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:27.160 align:start position:0%
expeditiously because because they need
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
to go to another committee such as
 
00:49:32.789 --> 00:49:32.799 align:start position:0%
Finance if there's a um a financial
 
00:49:35.549 --> 00:49:35.559 align:start position:0%
implication or it may be you know we
 
00:49:38.589 --> 00:49:38.599 align:start position:0%
deal with one bill that has to do with
 
00:49:40.829 --> 00:49:40.839 align:start position:0%
an animal thing but it's also might go
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
to a fishing game after us I don't know
 
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
but anyway the early bills get priority
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
treatment in order to have them heard
 
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
and exact quickly so they can move on we
 
00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:55.480 align:start position:0%
have in our
 
00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
committee right now six
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and um a subcommittee is a
 
00:50:04.589 --> 00:50:04.599 align:start position:0%
subset of our larger
 
00:50:04.599 --> 00:50:06.150 align:start position:0%
subset of our larger
committee

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
um when we have a bill that maybe needs
 
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit of extra work or uh some
 
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:18.440 align:start position:0%
further discussion uh subcommittees
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
those bills would be referred to the
 
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and subcommittees will
 
00:50:25.309 --> 00:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
report back to our
 
00:50:28.589 --> 00:50:28.599 align:start position:0%
committee um which will tell us what
 
00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
they've found out or what they've
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
decided about that particular bill to
 
00:50:36.789 --> 00:50:36.799 align:start position:0%
help us uh get through our our
 
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
work um each subcommittee will have a
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
designated chair so I have a a signup
 
00:50:47.069 --> 00:50:47.079 align:start position:0%
sheet for the six subcommittees that we
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
have here um this we had eight people on
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee last time and uh
 
00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby and I have decided
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
to pair that down down to five people
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
would be three Dem uh three Republicans
 
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
two Democrats on each one and so what
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do is I'm going to send
 
00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
this paper around if you have a
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that you're interested in
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
serving on please write your name down
 
00:51:16.349 --> 00:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
and uh representative Bixby and I will
 
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
then later go through and assign people
 
00:51:22.349 --> 00:51:22.359 align:start position:0%
to those committees the
 
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittees yes representative Miner
 
00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
uh with these subcommittees will it
 
00:51:29.069 --> 00:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
involve more time uh being here in in
 
00:51:33.069 --> 00:51:33.079 align:start position:0%
the uh uh legislative building yes so
 
00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
normally what what we've done in the
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
past is schedule the the person who was
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
doing who's chair of the subcommittee
 
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
would um schedule the subcommittee
 
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
probably prior to a committee meeting
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
hearing committee hearings or uh on
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
another day specific that all five
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
members can attend so I just want to be
 
00:51:59.309 --> 00:51:59.319 align:start position:0%
clear are are you saying that um that
 
00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:01.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting may not be on on a
 
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
Tuesday it may be on a different day
 
00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
correct it depends on the chair and the
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
committee members if they can decide on
 
00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
a meeting on another day specific but
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
those committee subcommittee meetings
 
00:52:17.349 --> 00:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
are noticed in the house calendar and
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
they are treated as a regular committee
 
00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
meeting would be treated they're live
 
00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
streamed they're uh people somebody
 
00:52:29.549 --> 00:52:29.559 align:start position:0%
takes notes and um and you guys work on
 
00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:31.640 align:start position:0%
particular piece of legislation okay
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
I'll have to I'll have to um speak to
 
00:52:35.549 --> 00:52:35.559 align:start position:0%
you more about this and sure thank you
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
sure representative Bixby yeah so we do
 
00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
make an effort to uh arrange it so that
 
00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee is can meet on a
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
Tuesday if depend it depends on how full
 
00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
our schedule is but we try to make it
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
possible to we try we we we try to to
 
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
minimize the number of days people need
 
00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
to come in right but we also have to
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
take keep in mind the the
 
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
full the full schedule and the and the
 
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
um and the deadlines sure I understand
 
00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
that but given my circumstances I mean
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
two days would be about the the most I
 
00:53:10.109 --> 00:53:10.119 align:start position:0%
could be here so we're going to have to
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
see if we can get creative with this
 
00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:15.640 align:start position:0%
right okay yep thank you anyone else any
 
00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:17.240 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
00:53:22.109 --> 00:53:22.119 align:start position:0%
that um Madam chair so there are two um
 
00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
areas where I feel like would I have
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
both interest in some expertise I are
 
00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
you asking people to sign up for as many
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
as they think they're interested in and
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
you pick just pick one or two one or two
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
yep thank
 
00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:39.309 align:start position:0%
yep thank
you

00:53:39.309 --> 00:53:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
okay um I also want to make it clear
 
00:53:46.589 --> 00:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
that it's not our job as a committee nor
 
00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
is it the job of the
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittees to fix a bad Bill we get a
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
bill that comes to us that's really not
 
00:53:58.430 --> 00:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
complete um um there's a whole lot of
 
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
moving parts and it's complicated and
 
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
the way it's written is just not you
 
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
know kind of a mess it's not really our
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
job to fix
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
it um there are bills that may come to
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
us that might you know have some extra
 
00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
questions that we want to get answered
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
that might need a little bit of um
 
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
tweaking here and there but a complete
 
00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
overhaul of any kind of Bill that comes
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
to us that's not really something that I
 
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
think we want to get involved in um we
 
00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
want to rely on the uh sponsor of the
 
00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
bill to really come with us come to us
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
with a bill that's uh you know
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
substantial and makes sense and works
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
and that we can
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
consider represent Bixby yeah so that
 
00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:53.720 align:start position:0%
being said uh what often drives our
 
00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
decision to amend a bill or not amend a
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
bill is how important we think the
 
00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
overriding issue is so last term we had
 
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
a bill on phosphate fertilizer and the
 
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
concept of the bill made a lot of sense
 
00:55:11.789 --> 00:55:11.799 align:start position:0%
the way that it had been drafted had a
 
00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
lot of problems so uh I took it on
 
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
myself and we decided as a committee
 
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
that it really made this is a really
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
important issue because cyanobacteria
 
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
blooms are you know getting out of hand
 
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:27.160 align:start position:0%
in the state and limiting phos is a huge
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
way to help mitigate that
 
00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
so uh I I took it on myself to do a lot
 
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
of leg work for doing the amendment on
 
00:55:38.349 --> 00:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
it and brought it to the subcommittee
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
and got more polishing on it and we
 
00:55:44.829 --> 00:55:44.839 align:start position:0%
managed to get that F through uh it
 
00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
passed you our committee unanimously
 
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
passed the house unanimously passed the
 
00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:49.750 align:start position:0%
passed the house unanimously passed the
Senate

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:52.359 align:start position:0%
unanimously we had a little bit of an
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
issue with the governor but we uh both
 
00:55:58.270 --> 00:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
the house the Senate uh made a very
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
large uh effort to make sure that it
 
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
that vetto got overridden and now it is
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh in and that was in law um on the
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
other hand there are other bills that
 
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
are just there might be some issue that
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
is real behind it but the approach that
 
00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
is suggested is just completely
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and in those cases we are
 
00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:25.559 align:start position:0%
likely more likely to say um back to the
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
drawing for next
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
year quite right representative
 
00:56:34.589 --> 00:56:34.599 align:start position:0%
ger represent last point we did a couple
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
of bills last time where the the
 
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
approach was just not workable it just
 
00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
not realistic but there was an
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
thats discuss a letter from thee to our
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
congal delation um so sometimes we're
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
able to ways talking commission or issu
 
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
or like
 
00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
that without spending more time than we
 
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
the sounds like a water fountain going
 
00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
on here thank you representative
 
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
Penza it was something something with my
 
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
mic sorry oh was it the mic yeah it was
 
00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
sounding it up worked so it Wasing on
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
the bill and the represent came
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill and immediately said
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
there's just a couple little problems
 
00:57:56.589 --> 00:57:56.599 align:start position:0%
with the bill and
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
you know the Bill's already on board
 
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
with the Senate U the senator was there
 
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
and brought the amendment and so instead
 
00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:07.240 align:start position:0%
of having that Amendment have to get so
 
00:58:09.309 --> 00:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
the bill goes through the house go
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
through the committee and then goes
 
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
through the house and then has to go to
 
00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
Senate and then get Amendment there he
 
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to see if the committee he
 
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
brought the amendment forward would take
 
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
that amendment in so I'm hoping that if
 
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:21.640 align:start position:0%
there's you know collaboration on the
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
other side which we need you know we
 
00:58:26.349 --> 00:58:26.359 align:start position:0%
need them to to push things through May
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
if there's any issues with any of the
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
bills that are coming forward to our
 
00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
committee that we could have that
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
collaboration with Senator as well they
 
00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:39.559 align:start position:0%
inherent so yeah and I just want to make
 
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
it clear too that when any bill goes to
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
a committee is your sponsor or
 
00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor sponsor comes and introduces
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
the bill to the committee it is then the
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
committee's bill it is no longer the
 
00:58:55.789 --> 00:58:55.799 align:start position:0%
sponsor's bill so but the sponsor can
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
come and say look at you know I've got
 
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
an amendment in hand because I saw that
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
there was this problem and we can
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
consider that Amendment um so there's
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
that representative kamat thank you
 
00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:14.200 align:start position:0%
madam chair um and the other thing is is
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
that this committee does really well is
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
if we find that not only the issue is
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
very important we can retain the bill
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
and work on
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:37.720 align:start position:0%
mine uh so thank you madam chair um I
 
00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:39.160 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say that if there's a
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
topic that's very important to us but
 
00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
say the bill isn't ready for prime time
 
00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
but we feel as a committee in the first
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
year we can retain that bill and then
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
work on it over a course of a few months
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
um so that we can uh come up with with
 
00:59:59.230 --> 00:59:59.240 align:start position:0%
better language um and I know that a lot
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
of committees when they you know I've
 
01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
heard that when they retain a bill or
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
something we actually work on all bills
 
01:00:08.589 --> 01:00:08.599 align:start position:0%
we retain we don't retain bills if we're
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
not going to work on them we delve into
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
the subjects um we do deep Dives in this
 
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
committee which I think is extremely
 
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
important for everyone to understand
 
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
um we take our our jobs uh seriously and
 
01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
retaining a bill is also an option
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank
 
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
you okay anybody else have anything to
 
01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:37.240 align:start position:0%
add any of our veterans NOP okay um so I
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
just want to also go over we do have
 
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
assigned to our committee a committee
 
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
researcher her name is Christy a freser
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
she takes the place of Kristen Grant who
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
was our committee researcher last year
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
um and they have
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
help they help provide information to
 
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
help our committee members do our job um
 
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
they also assist the committee chair the
 
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
clerk subcommittee chairs and they're
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
just technical
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
helpers um the research staff work with
 
01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
the committee chairs and vice chairs to
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
ensure that we get information that we
 
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
need so if you have you want to get more
 
01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
information about
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know certain use of rodenticides
 
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
or or uh a certain technology that's
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
being used um you can ask me to ask the
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
committee researcher to do some research
 
01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
for you and I'd be happy to do that um
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
but all requests would have to come
 
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
through the chair it's not like you can
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
go to Christie yourself as a member and
 
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
say hey can you do this research for me
 
01:01:59.069 --> 01:01:59.079 align:start position:0%
that way cuts down any possibility of um
 
01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
say representative sofikitis and
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny asking for the same
 
01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:07.160 align:start position:0%
information um independently and not
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
knowing we don't we don't want to have
 
01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:12.220 align:start position:0%
duplicate work being done
 
01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:14.750 align:start position:0%
duplicate work being done

um they everything that they basically
 
01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
work with the committee leadership and
 
01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:26.039 align:start position:0%
um and uh so when you're uh you so uh
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
take the lead from Judy and from
 
01:04:34.269 --> 01:04:34.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
Andes contact that you have with the
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
assistant I you could say hi and be
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
friendly and all that sort of things but
 
01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of asking for any sort of work
 
01:04:46.269 --> 01:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
that should come through the chair the
 
01:04:46.279 --> 01:04:48.309 align:start position:0%
that should come through the chair the
committee

01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:04:48.319 --> 01:04:52.670 align:start position:0%
committee
leadership

01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
this okay I think there's a problem in
 
01:05:09.309 --> 01:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
the system
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
yeah all right but we'll move along
 
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
that's okay um regarding our public
 
01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:20.200 align:start position:0%
hearings um our public hearings are open
 
01:05:22.029 --> 01:05:22.039 align:start position:0%
to the public and members of the public
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
agency heads and other representatives
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
from organizations to come to test
 
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
testify on the bills being heard it is
 
01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
not necessary to have a committee Quorum
 
01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
as a quorum is only needed for any
 
01:05:35.069 --> 01:05:35.079 align:start position:0%
deliberation and official action so we
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
need a quorum if we're going to vote on
 
01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
anything or exec on any
 
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
decorum treat everyone as you would like
 
01:05:49.549 --> 01:05:49.559 align:start position:0%
to be treated um we want to make sure
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
that we give people the respect um and
 
01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
courtesy that we would like to have have
 
01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:56.870 align:start position:0%
courtesy that we would like to have have
for

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
ourselves um for members of the
 
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
committee uh we ask that you remove any
 
01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
buttons or stickers that show any kind
 
01:06:08.190 --> 01:06:08.200 align:start position:0%
of advocacy for or against any
 
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
particular topic that comes before us we

questions avoid sharing your knowledge
 
01:07:21.269 --> 01:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
on the subject or your opinion this is
 
01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
the time for the public to tell us what
 
01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:26.839 align:start position:0%
they think
 
01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
we are here to listen and gather
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
information and all questions will come
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
through me so if representative Kenny
 
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
has a question um she would raise her
 
01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
hand I would say representative Kenny
 
01:07:47.269 --> 01:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
and then you would uh she would direct
 
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
her question to the person
 
01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:55.839 align:start position:0%
testifying uh sure represent ktoa
 
01:07:58.510 --> 01:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh the other thing
 
01:07:59.950 --> 01:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
too is
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
that um the chair gets to everyone
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes she doesn't see your hand but
 
01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:07.799 align:start position:0%
uh there's myself and the clerk will
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
always be looking to see if someone has
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
her hand raised so um wait for her to
 
01:08:16.749 --> 01:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
recognize you if you ask a question and
 
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
you have another question you have to
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
ask the chair if you can do a follow-up
 
01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
you just don't get to do a free-for-all
 
01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
for questions every question goes
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
through the
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
chair thank you yeah we we want to try
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
and keep it as uh organized as we can
 
01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
otherwise everybody's talking over each
 
01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
other and that's not good representative
 
01:08:40.829 --> 01:08:40.839 align:start position:0%
King thank you madam this one's not
 
01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
working well well
 
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair um I'm assuming
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
it's the same in this committee as it
 
01:08:51.070 --> 01:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
was in my last committee that if you
 
01:08:52.669 --> 01:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
need to get up and use the restroom or
 
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
walk away at any time you're not
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
obligated to stay stuck in your seat you
 
01:08:58.590 --> 01:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
can just get up and go out um people
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
often do that if they have uh another
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
bill they want to testify on in a
 
01:09:05.229 --> 01:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
different committee or if they want to
 
01:09:07.709 --> 01:09:07.719 align:start position:0%
speak with somebody who just testified
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
they want to have a talk outside in the
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
in the room you're not not glued to your
 
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.030 align:start position:0%
in the room you're not not glued to your
seat

01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
seat
 
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
so yes but I would that being said I
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
would like to make sure that um you are
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
not getting up moving around coming to
 
01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
your seat leaving your seat in the
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
middle of somebody testifying because it
 
01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:31.719 align:start position:0%
is rude and um if you would wait until
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
the person has finished
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
testifying uh to get up and leave for
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
whatever reason then that's perfectly
 
01:09:43.870 --> 01:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
fine uh thank you Ma thank you madam
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
chair uh the other thing is is if you do
 
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
get up and you leave your seat you need
 
01:09:51.789 --> 01:09:51.799 align:start position:0%
to wait at the end of the aisle until
 
01:09:53.789 --> 01:09:53.799 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes you to come back to
 
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
your seat um that way if we're in the
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
middle of a conversation there's no
 
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
disruptions for anybody the other thing
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
is is that nobody from the audience can
 
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
go past these desks um and come behind
 
01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.870 align:start position:0%
go past these desks um and come behind
our

01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
Bixby oh dear all right I'm gonna just
 
01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
try to speak loudly okay all right so uh
 
01:10:25.149 --> 01:10:25.159 align:start position:0%
one other thing in terms of and I think
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
that I I agree entirely with everything
 
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
that representative Aaron said in terms
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
of uh decorum and uh politeness with
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
people who are testifying and I just
 
01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
like to amplify that one of the things
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
that is part of that is never suggesting
 
01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
that someone who is testifying has some
 
01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
sort of a particular ulterior motive uh
 
01:10:51.149 --> 01:10:51.159 align:start position:0%
we uh we want to be dealing with facts
 
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
here we don't try to guess people's
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
motives and another thing that can
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
happen is if someone who is testifying
 
01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
is suggesting that there is an
 
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
alternative motive to someone some other
 
01:11:05.709 --> 01:11:05.719 align:start position:0%
speaker or some other side then uh the
 
01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
chair will uh gavel that and say that is
 
01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
not appropriate so uh we're trying to
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
really get the facts out we are uh this
 
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
is not about uh individual people this
 
01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
is not about personalities this is about
 
01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
what facts we need to deal with in order
 
01:11:26.669 --> 01:11:26.679 align:start position:0%
to make a good uh decision
 
01:11:26.679 --> 01:11:27.669 align:start position:0%
to make a good uh decision
any

01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.629 --> 01:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
ger no oh my goodness all right I just
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
want to use myself as an example of of
 
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
how not to behave uh and and that
 
01:11:45.070 --> 01:11:45.080 align:start position:0%
representative chair Aon brought up the
 
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
point about especially with members of
 
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
the public importance of the Forum but
 
01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
also with some of our colleagues who
 
01:11:53.149 --> 01:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
will testify we had a bill uh last
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
session where you know of our colleagues
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
was was presenting in a bill and was
 
01:11:59.629 --> 01:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
making a number of statements that were
 
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
simply factually inaccurate um um and I
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
was part of the problem with the bill
 
01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
and I admit I kind of you know got into
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
that argumentative mode with my
 
01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
questions um and Not only was it not
 
01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
helpful for the bill but it's also as
 
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
we've talked about how to reduce the
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
amount of time we spend on bills that
 
01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
are nowhere near ready for prime time
 
01:12:25.629 --> 01:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
that's one of the ways we make more
 
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
efficient use of our time it's by not
 
01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
asking questions that don't need to be
 
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
asked but I I know I was guilty of that
 
01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
and it may be a Temptation at times but
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's important to resist representative
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
kto then Penza thank you madam chair um
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to follow up uh with uh
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
represent bxby and represent Jama and I
 
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
know that sometimes it's easy that we
 
01:12:49.709 --> 01:12:49.719 align:start position:0%
can get
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
confrontational um it you know and we
 
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
have to do that the time to discuss the
 
01:12:59.070 --> 01:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
bill and what has been said is in exec
 
01:13:01.629 --> 01:13:01.639 align:start position:0%
session we will have the opportunity to
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
discuss everybody that testified in all
 
01:13:07.229 --> 01:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
testimony and we can go through it and
 
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
dissect it when we're executing a bill
 
01:13:11.229 --> 01:13:11.239 align:start position:0%
or if that bill has been referred at to
 
01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee um so there is a chance
 
01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
to go through everything and uh really
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
have the committee work it all out if
 
01:13:23.629 --> 01:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
there's any questions represent
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
Penza no
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
I guess mine is the only one huh this
 
01:13:32.229 --> 01:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
one work no oh mine works you
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
mine I don't have any problems speaking
 
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
loudly um I agree with all of the points
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
um except for one piece like if you have
 
01:13:44.669 --> 01:13:44.679 align:start position:0%
someone that is truly testifying that is
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
giving factually incorrect information
 
01:13:50.629 --> 01:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
you can you can you can question them on
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
that if you know what the truth is it's
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
not that like we're not going to just
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
let blanket whatever happened I mean
 
01:14:01.709 --> 01:14:01.719 align:start position:0%
that's that's our job um I do believe if
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
it's a bogus bill and I think this is
 
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
the point of where we all know what
 
01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
happened with the tabling right we we
 
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
all heard all the backlash for that um
 
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
if we know it's a bogus bill that's you
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
know the way to get through it real
 
01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
quickly is not to egg them on like you
 
01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
know what Nick is say so
 
01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
just let it let it go and then you know
 
01:14:25.229 --> 01:14:25.239 align:start position:0%
we don't even have to any question we
 
01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
know it's is something that's gonna
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
quickly get it anyway
 
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
so represent Bixby uh two points um one
 
01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
just adding on to what what
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative kis said about executive
 
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
session we often will also have a work
 
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
session on bills and that is where we
 
01:14:46.629 --> 01:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
sort of have an initial discussion with
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
the amongst the committee members about
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
what should happen with the bill and are
 
01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
there things we need to do to improve it
 
01:14:57.390 --> 01:14:57.400 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing is that I would um
 
01:14:59.470 --> 01:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
respectively disagree with uh
 
01:15:01.629 --> 01:15:01.639 align:start position:0%
representative Penza about uh
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
challenging someone who is saying
 
01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:06.679 align:start position:0%
something that is uh that is not factual
 
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
you can ask a clarifying question to say
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that they're you know
 
01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
that they what they're saying is what
 
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
they intend to say or if they they might
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
adjust it if they realize oh I said that
 
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
wrong or you might ask them or you might
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
ask them where did you get that
 
01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:40.950 align:start position:0%
ask them where did you get that
information

01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
if someone is insisting on something
 
01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
that you are fairly sure is not factual
 
01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get to change that
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
they're not going to change it so
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
another approach is when someone else is
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
testifying you might ask the same
 
01:15:58.750 --> 01:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
question to get second appendant yeah
 
01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:00.750 align:start position:0%
question to get second appendant yeah
okay

01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
um so uh when somebody is uh coming to
 
01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:09.400 align:start position:0%
testify we will get pink cards uh and
 
01:16:14.189 --> 01:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
have them call them up as they uh have
 
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
have their pin cards to us um we would
 
01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:19.719 align:start position:0%
ask the speakers to State their name who
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
they represent for the record submit
 
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
copies of any written testimony and
 
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
summarize it for the committee and
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
refrain from repeating what has already
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
been said if we have many many people
 
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
coming to testify I will
 
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
certainly remind uh some of the folks
 
01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
that uh if they've heard something being
 
01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
said before that they don't need to
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
repeat it for us so that we're not
 
01:16:46.629 --> 01:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
hearing the same thing 50 million
 
01:16:52.110 --> 01:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
times um we may at times uh put in some
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
time limits for speakers uh sometimes we
 
01:16:57.669 --> 01:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
had asked them only to testify for about
 
01:16:57.679 --> 01:16:58.590 align:start position:0%
had asked them only to testify for about
3

01:16:58.590 --> 01:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
3
 
01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.270 align:start position:0%
3
minutes

01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
um so those you know we we kind of set
 
01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:05.320 align:start position:0%
the set the ground rules for any
 
01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.590 align:start position:0%
the set the ground rules for any
particular

01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
hearing when committee members are
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
sponsors or co-sponsors of bills some of
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
you are co-sponsors of bills that may
 
01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
come or sponsors of bills that may come
 
01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
to our committee so what happens with
 
01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
that a Committee Member who is also a
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor or co-sponsor of a bill before
 
01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:25.709 align:start position:0%
sponsor or co-sponsor of a bill before
the

01:17:25.709 --> 01:17:25.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:28.990 --> 01:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
committee say you sponsor bill you can
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
come and um introduce the bill to the
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
committee or you can testify as a
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor to the
 
01:17:39.550 --> 01:17:39.560 align:start position:0%
committee um the thing with that is if
 
01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:41.350 align:start position:0%
committee um the thing with that is if
you

01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
testify you cannot sit here and an ask
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
questions of subsequent
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
um in a moment
 
01:17:58.990 --> 01:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
a sponsor or co-sponsor who does not
 
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
testify may ask questions of other
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
testimonials so if one exception is if a
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
bill was filed by the chair me or
 
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
another member as a courtesy to an
 
01:18:14.110 --> 01:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
executive department or the judicial
 
01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
branch these bills have a line stating
 
01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
at the top by whose request they were
 
01:18:23.470 --> 01:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
introduced and um so there's that
 
01:18:25.229 --> 01:18:25.239 align:start position:0%
representative Penza would you like to
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
add to that no I well first had a
 
01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
question for what you said so so if
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
you're if you're announcing a bill for
 
01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
no I believe you can yes so uh if if the
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill does not appear to
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
testify and you are and you are simply
 
01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill pro forma as a
 
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
courtesy for that sponsor who was not
 
01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
able to make it then
 
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
that does not put a limmit on your
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
ability correct
 
01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
correct my my other question was um if
 
01:19:07.390 --> 01:19:07.400 align:start position:0%
you are the uh if you're a co-sponsor or
 
01:19:10.030 --> 01:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
the main sponsor and you're speaking or
 
01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
testifying um and you know that there's
 
01:19:14.669 --> 01:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
other people on the committee that
 
01:19:17.629 --> 01:19:17.639 align:start position:0%
support your bill um give them the
 
01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
questions that you want to ask whoever
 
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
else is going to testify so you know
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
somebody that has way too many bills
 
01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:27.639 align:start position:0%
um is going to have to be working that
 
01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure I'm not able to sit here
 
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
and ask
 
01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
questions okay engage your committee
 
01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:36.750 align:start position:0%
questions okay engage your committee
anything

01:19:36.750 --> 01:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
else okay because we're running short on
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
time now um so for ex we will on
 
01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
occasion have work work sessions after
 
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
we hear testimony on bills and we kind
 
01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
of want to get a sense of of where the
 
01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
committee is on that we will have work
 
01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
sessions prior to having any kind of
 
01:19:57.310 --> 01:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
exec session on a bill representative
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah one more quick note about um
 
01:20:04.030 --> 01:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
about public input uh there is also a
 
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
blue sheet where people can sign in uh
 
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
in favor or against a bill where they
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
when they aren't speaking and there is
 
01:20:10.239 --> 01:20:10.990 align:start position:0%
when they aren't speaking and there is
an

01:20:10.990 --> 01:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:20:15.149 --> 01:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
online uh place where people can sign in
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
in favor or against bills and we
 
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
announced the numbers of uh how many
 
01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
people signed in on blue sheet and how
 
01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:23.560 align:start position:0%
many people signed in online for and
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
against at the end of the hearing on a
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
bill I would also uh recommend that uh
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee take a look at
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
the online portal for where uh testimony
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
is submitted because a lot of times
 
01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:38.719 align:start position:0%
there are people who will submit
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
testimony and not come to the committee
 
01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
and we should read what they have
 
01:20:46.270 --> 01:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
written so that we know uh what their
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
thoughts are on that so for executive
 
01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
they are you know run the same a chair
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
the chair opens the executive session we
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
have discussion on bills um we make
 
01:21:09.709 --> 01:21:09.719 align:start position:0%
motions um to either itl OTP or
 
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
whatever retain it refer to interim
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
study whatever um and the the
 
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
uh I will recommend I I will
 
01:21:25.629 --> 01:21:25.639 align:start position:0%
um um I will then you know ask who who
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
has the who has a motion to present we
 
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
have a discussion on that um and then we
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
vote on it or we look at amendments uh
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
on that bill as well and uh look to vote
 
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
on those
 
01:21:42.669 --> 01:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
amendments um so I have the procedure
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
here on on how executive sessions are
 
01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
run then of course we have committee
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
reports so the committee reports are the
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
little short paragraph blurbs that um
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
appear in the house calendar when we are
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
setting as a body in the house to vote
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
on uh certain
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
bills and um the person who makes the
 
01:22:11.709 --> 01:22:11.719 align:start position:0%
motion in exec session for the bill say
 
01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative King makes a motion to
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
itl specif HB 1590 or whatever it is um
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
he would then be the one to write the
 
01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
committee report uh if that motion were
 
01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:27.270 align:start position:0%
committee report uh if that motion were
to

01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
pass um the committee report is intended
 
01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
to be a clear concise summary of the
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
legislation the committee's reason for
 
01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
making its recommendation they are very
 
01:22:40.110 --> 01:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
important documents they're permanent
 
01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
record of the committee's work and the
 
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
first opportunity to educate all house
 
01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:47.320 align:start position:0%
members about the bill when it's printed
 
01:22:50.590 --> 01:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
uh in the house calendar we don't need
 
01:22:52.669 --> 01:22:52.679 align:start position:0%

01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%

uh committee reports are
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
written I review those committee I
 
01:24:04.709 --> 01:24:04.719 align:start position:0%
review those committee reports and I
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
look to see that they're complete and
 
01:24:09.229 --> 01:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
that they have um you know correct
 
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
information um I don't really take too
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh heavily editing anything and if
 
01:24:16.629 --> 01:24:16.639 align:start position:0%
something I think needs to be changed
 
01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
I'll talk to you about it representative
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah so uh if you were writing a
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
committee report for the first second or
 
01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:27.400 align:start position:0%
you if not you're you're not very
 
01:24:29.790 --> 01:24:29.800 align:start position:0%
experienced at it then there are more
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
experienced members of the committee who
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
will be happy to help you in terms of
 
01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
phrasing and whatnot uh and so you know
 
01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the experience on the
 
01:24:42.270 --> 01:24:42.280 align:start position:0%
committee to um to get some assistance
 
01:24:44.109 --> 01:24:44.119 align:start position:0%
in writing those until you're feeling
 
01:24:46.149 --> 01:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
confident on it yourself okay
 
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa thank you madam
 
01:24:52.149 --> 01:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
chair and the committee report uh can be
 
01:24:54.910 --> 01:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
a majority report or a minority report
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
because a minority if we have a
 
01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
difference in voting uh someone may want
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
to write a Minority Report um but that
 
01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:04.360 align:start position:0%
still goes through the chair for
 
01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:07.480 align:start position:0%
review U clarification when we say
 
01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
majority or minority it the minor is the
 
01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
majority or minority on the particular
 
01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
vote for that bill it might be that uh
 
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
that it's that it's completely you know
 
01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
re divorced from any sort of partisan uh
 
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
character membership
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
but it's just who had the most votes on
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
the B on the vot on Motion versus who
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
had the the smaller number of votes yeah
 
01:25:34.350 --> 01:25:34.360 align:start position:0%
we've had majority reports that have
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
been bipartisan that's fine
 
01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:38.590 align:start position:0%
been bipartisan that's fine
representative

01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:47.030 align:start position:0%
representative
Freeman

01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
I'm well the the the committee report is
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
normally written by the person who made
 
01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
the amend the uh motion in the exec
 
01:25:58.030 --> 01:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
session so uh if there's a reason why
 
01:26:00.629 --> 01:26:00.639 align:start position:0%
they can't write it um they can ask me
 
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
and I can do something about that
 
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
representative Penza I also wanted to um
 
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
during our last session when we voted on
 
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
rules someone had brought up about um
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
making sure that those reports from a
 
01:26:18.270 --> 01:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
clerk couldn't be modified um I just
 
01:26:19.790 --> 01:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
wanted everybody in this committee to
 
01:26:22.030 --> 01:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
know we haven't had any issues with that
 
01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
at all um there's you know if there's a
 
01:26:27.790 --> 01:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
grammatical error or something like that
 
01:26:30.189 --> 01:26:30.199 align:start position:0%
that gets fixed but the content of your
 
01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
message from a majority or a minority
 
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
has never been touched in this committee
 
01:26:35.870 --> 01:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
I know that it has happened in other
 
01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
committees that's why that was brought
 
01:26:39.629 --> 01:26:39.639 align:start position:0%
forward it wasn't a frivolous thing to
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
say but I want to sure everyone you know
 
01:26:47.109 --> 01:26:47.119 align:start position:0%
we yeah the best committe yeah well when
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
I get committee reports from folks and I
 
01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
need to get some kind of clarification
 
01:26:53.629 --> 01:26:53.639 align:start position:0%
or something or something doesn't sound
 
01:26:56.470 --> 01:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
right I will communicate with the person
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
who wrote the committee report and say
 
01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
look it can you re can we reword it to
 
01:27:03.669 --> 01:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
say this and such so we work together on
 
01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
that collaboration always representative
 
01:27:09.709 --> 01:27:09.719 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah and so the the reports
 
01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
written by the person who makes the
 
01:27:14.350 --> 01:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
motion uh usually before an executive
 
01:27:16.629 --> 01:27:16.639 align:start position:0%
session representative Aron and I will
 
01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
sit down and talk about who's going to
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
make the motion who's going to make the
 
01:27:22.590 --> 01:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
seconds on all of the bills we're
 
01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
discussing and or or that are on the
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
schedule for the executive session so
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
and we will then um sort of bring up we
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
will ask members of our caucuses uh who
 
01:27:37.629 --> 01:27:37.639 align:start position:0%
wants to make motions on particular
 
01:27:40.830 --> 01:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
bills so that um you're not going to be
 
01:27:43.270 --> 01:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
suddenly uh learning that you're going
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
to be making the motion and you're going
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
to be make writing the report about
 
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
something you know without any you know
 
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
prior knowledge it's all it's pretty
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair I assume it's
 
01:28:01.229 --> 01:28:01.239 align:start position:0%
not a requirement that a Minority Report
 
01:28:05.109 --> 01:28:05.119 align:start position:0%
be written how is that handled in this
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
committee representative Bixby so uh the
 
01:28:11.550 --> 01:28:11.560 align:start position:0%
people who are on the minority of a vote
 
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
decide amongst themselves whether
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to write a report and
 
01:28:18.669 --> 01:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
who's going to do it uh and sometimes
 
01:28:24.270 --> 01:28:24.280 align:start position:0%
there'll be a situation where uh
 
01:28:27.149 --> 01:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
there was a minority vote but it wasn't
 
01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
something that people cared an awful lot
 
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
about and they'll just let it slide on
 
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
on the other hand there might be a
 
01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:35.119 align:start position:0%
minority vote and it might be a minority
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
of one but that person cares an awful
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
lot in which case there'll be a Minority
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
Report sure and then we'll also um agree
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
as to whether something would go on
 
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
consent or not and of course there would
 
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
have to be a um um a committee report to
 
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
go along uh with that
 
01:28:57.709 --> 01:28:57.719 align:start position:0%
representative King and um sometimes
 
01:29:00.310 --> 01:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
there can be a a minority position that
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
will still allow it to go to consent
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
calendar y y
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
so right as long as if there's a
 
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
Minority Report it can't go in consent
 
01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
but if there's a if let's say two people
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
just vote against the bill uh if they
 
01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
say during the executive section we're
 
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
okay with this being on consent then it
 
01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
can still go on consent right okay are
 
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
we clear on that all right
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
good uh okay last thing field
 
01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
trips we typically organize farm and
 
01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
other related tours and we have in the
 
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
past and we will give plenty of notice
 
01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
on when and where um these tours will
 
01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
take place in fact I do have
 
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
um I do have a request
 
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
from um Rob Johnson from Farm Bureau
 
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
about whether or not the committee would
 
01:29:58.629 --> 01:29:58.639 align:start position:0%
like to have uh the young Farmers
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
breakfast in March or April so that is
 
01:30:03.709 --> 01:30:03.719 align:start position:0%
something that we're going to have to uh
 
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
figure out and talk to talk about but
 
01:30:10.109 --> 01:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
we've already been invited to uh to do
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
the farm
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
breakfast um so when we have these field
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
trips we hope that committee members
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
will participate and come uh you will
 
01:30:22.270 --> 01:30:22.280 align:start position:0%
likely get mileage for those field trips
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
and those trips are designed to help you
 
01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
increase our knowledge on various issues
 
01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
last year we visited um landfills we
 
01:30:34.669 --> 01:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
went uh to visit UNH extension green
 
01:30:36.910 --> 01:30:36.920 align:start position:0%
houses we've done a bunch of different
 
01:30:40.030 --> 01:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
interesting things representative Howard
 
01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say that I attended
 
01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
every field trip last time and highly
 
01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
relevant and very interesting and learn
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
okay so that's pretty much us in a in a
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
nutshell um you'll certainly have
 
01:31:03.870 --> 01:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
questions as we go along as will I and
 
01:31:06.149 --> 01:31:06.159 align:start position:0%

02:36:18.870 --> 02:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
anytime so we can give you a better
 
02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
understanding of what we what we do and
 
02:36:23.910 --> 02:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
where we're located uh and you all you
 
02:36:26.429 --> 02:36:26.439 align:start position:0%
folks will all be over there next next
 
02:36:29.910 --> 02:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
year next January y so uh right most of
 
02:36:30.910 --> 02:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
the hearings are going to be right on
 
02:36:33.110 --> 02:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
the same floor as we are we'll be seeing
 
02:36:35.590 --> 02:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of you and U that'll be a good
 
02:36:38.190 --> 02:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
thing so
 
02:36:41.790 --> 02:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
um just an overview of the department
 
02:36:42.910 --> 02:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not going to read our
 
02:36:45.950 --> 02:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
mission you can do that but you can see
 
02:36:48.830 --> 02:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
we have six full divisions although
 
02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:50.030 align:start position:0%
we have six full divisions although
really

02:36:50.030 --> 02:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:36:51.870 --> 02:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
uh fsma which is food safety
 
02:36:55.510 --> 02:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
modernization act is a uh a small
 
02:36:58.510 --> 02:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
division directly under me nobody wanted
 
02:37:01.309 --> 02:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
to take it on when we took it over from
 
02:37:04.469 --> 02:37:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh Health and Human Services so I am
 
02:37:07.349 --> 02:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
really acting as the division head on on
 
02:37:11.590 --> 02:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
that we have 44 approved positions when
 
02:37:15.469 --> 02:37:15.479 align:start position:0%
I came on as commissioner in December of
 
02:37:21.269 --> 02:37:21.279 align:start position:0%
17 we had 32 filled positions with 38
 
02:37:25.830 --> 02:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
authorized and as of today we have 44
 
02:37:29.790 --> 02:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
filled positions um we are we have no
 
02:37:32.670 --> 02:37:32.680 align:start position:0%
vacancies in the department and uh we
 
02:37:35.190 --> 02:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
also have added over that period of time
 
02:37:36.990 --> 02:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
a lead
 
02:37:40.429 --> 02:37:40.439 align:start position:0%
it uh individual who technically works
 
02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
for Department of uh Information
 
02:37:45.349 --> 02:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
Technology but is embedded and has his
 
02:37:48.190 --> 02:37:48.200 align:start position:0%
office there uh he will also be working
 
02:37:50.750 --> 02:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
with Jud judicial Council which is on
 
02:37:51.670 --> 02:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:37:55.130 --> 02:37:55.140 align:start position:0%
floor as we are so
 
02:37:55.140 --> 02:37:56.790 align:start position:0%
floor as we are so
[Music]

02:37:56.790 --> 02:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:37:58.630 --> 02:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
um let me
 
02:38:00.990 --> 02:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
see y so you're going to hear from
 
02:38:04.030 --> 02:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
everybody except uh bismo the food
 
02:38:07.309 --> 02:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
safety modernization act uh which is
 
02:38:09.990 --> 02:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
fully Federal federally funded if the
 
02:38:12.150 --> 02:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
feds pull the funding the program goes
 
02:38:13.790 --> 02:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
away but that's where we go out and we
 
02:38:16.830 --> 02:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
do uh inspections on any place that is
 
02:38:19.750 --> 02:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
growing food that is being consumed our
 
02:38:23.429 --> 02:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
primary focus is on food that is ready
 
02:38:26.790 --> 02:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
to eat to make sure that that food is
 
02:38:30.389 --> 02:38:30.399 align:start position:0%
handled properly so that in fact you
 
02:38:32.550 --> 02:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
know there there aren't problems with
 
02:38:35.070 --> 02:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
that we're less concerned about food
 
02:38:39.469 --> 02:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
that has to be cooked um but regardless
 
02:38:39.479 --> 02:38:40.150 align:start position:0%
that has to be cooked um but regardless
we

02:38:40.150 --> 02:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:38:42.830 --> 02:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
do take a great deal of care in making
 
02:38:44.830 --> 02:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
sure that everything is done according
 
02:38:48.030 --> 02:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
to the best standards
 
02:38:51.469 --> 02:38:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:53.070 --> 02:38:53.080 align:start position:0%
where do I go from
 
02:38:56.750 --> 02:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
there the next Slide the overview of
 
02:38:58.269 --> 02:38:58.279 align:start position:0%
course we're promoting and regulating
 
02:39:01.510 --> 02:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
all branches of Agriculture regulating
 
02:39:04.190 --> 02:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
commercial transactions involving
 
02:39:07.389 --> 02:39:07.399 align:start position:0%
weights distance volume of time volume
 
02:39:12.070 --> 02:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
and time um I would gather to say or
 
02:39:14.469 --> 02:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
dare to say perhaps that you probably
 
02:39:17.590 --> 02:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
don't go more than a day or two without
 
02:39:20.110 --> 02:39:20.120 align:start position:0%
doing something that we
 
02:39:22.750 --> 02:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
regulate um you'll find out about the
 
02:39:23.670 --> 02:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
02:39:26.309 --> 02:39:26.319 align:start position:0%
any measuring or weighing device is
 
02:39:28.150 --> 02:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
regulated by us and you'll hear more
 
02:39:31.670 --> 02:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
about that from from that division um
 
02:39:34.630 --> 02:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
and so we really have our hands on
 
02:39:36.870 --> 02:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
things that you know people don't
 
02:39:39.030 --> 02:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
understand until they really delve into
 
02:39:42.630 --> 02:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
it um the we regulate the grade and
 
02:39:44.590 --> 02:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
quality of agricultural
 
02:39:48.110 --> 02:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
crops uh gather information disseminate
 
02:39:51.469 --> 02:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
that we we do a lot of cooperation with
 
02:39:51.479 --> 02:39:52.429 align:start position:0%
that we we do a lot of cooperation with
other

02:39:52.429 --> 02:39:52.439 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:39:55.550 --> 02:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
agencies um our sister organization if
 
02:39:57.950 --> 02:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
you will is really coopera Cooperative
 
02:39:59.670 --> 02:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
Extension at the University of New
 
02:40:03.510 --> 02:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have great relationship
 
02:40:06.429 --> 02:40:06.439 align:start position:0%
with Cooperative Extension and work with
 
02:40:08.389 --> 02:40:08.399 align:start position:0%
them we have contracts but there are
 
02:40:09.870 --> 02:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
times when they just say hey you need
 
02:40:12.510 --> 02:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
help we'll help you for instance when we
 
02:40:15.910 --> 02:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
when we first got into um the whole
 
02:40:17.910 --> 02:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
problem during the pandemic and the
 
02:40:20.190 --> 02:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
federal money that we had there
 
02:40:23.150 --> 02:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
um they just hopped in and helped and
 
02:40:25.670 --> 02:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
there were no charges uh to us on that
 
02:40:27.469 --> 02:40:27.479 align:start position:0%
so it's a great organization at the
 
02:40:30.269 --> 02:40:30.279 align:start position:0%
University and I'm pleased to say that
 
02:40:33.150 --> 02:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
as of July 1
 
02:40:35.910 --> 02:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
um The Cooperative Extension will be
 
02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:37.030 align:start position:0%
um The Cooperative Extension will be
back

02:40:37.030 --> 02:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
back
 
02:40:40.190 --> 02:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
under um College of life science and
 
02:40:42.030 --> 02:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
agriculture which it has not been for a
 
02:40:45.429 --> 02:40:45.439 align:start position:0%
while thankfully the new president UNH
 
02:40:47.910 --> 02:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
who came from land grant school and
 
02:40:47.920 --> 02:40:49.550 align:start position:0%
who came from land grant school and
understood

02:40:49.550 --> 02:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
understood
 
02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
that um was very receptive to that idea
 
02:40:55.269 --> 02:40:55.279 align:start position:0%
when I mentioned it to her and said we
 
02:40:56.830 --> 02:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
really need to do this and there's a lot
 
02:40:58.710 --> 02:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
of good good reasons and she's made it
 
02:41:01.630 --> 02:41:01.640 align:start position:0%
happen so very pleased with that and
 
02:41:03.790 --> 02:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
then of course we do whatever else the
 
02:41:05.510 --> 02:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
legislature tells us to do to the best
 
02:41:07.910 --> 02:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
of our ability including pet vending
 
02:41:11.469 --> 02:41:11.479 align:start position:0%
which we would really rather not be
 
02:41:15.110 --> 02:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
doing so the budget overview I think is
 
02:41:18.389 --> 02:41:18.399 align:start position:0%
pretty important this this last year our
 
02:41:20.469 --> 02:41:20.479 align:start position:0%
total authorized spending is just over
 
02:41:20.479 --> 02:41:22.230 align:start position:0%
total authorized spending is just over
$9

02:41:22.230 --> 02:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
$9
 
02:41:25.070 --> 02:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
million 4.9 million comes from the
 
02:41:25.080 --> 02:41:26.269 align:start position:0%
million 4.9 million comes from the
general

02:41:26.269 --> 02:41:26.279 align:start position:0%
general
 
02:41:30.110 --> 02:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
fund 2.9 from other almost three million
 
02:41:34.269 --> 02:41:34.279 align:start position:0%
from other sources and uh
 
02:41:38.429 --> 02:41:38.439 align:start position:0%
1.1 from federal funds but I would note
 
02:41:40.389 --> 02:41:40.399 align:start position:0%
that the total unrestricted revenues
 
02:41:42.070 --> 02:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
that were projected to bring in for this
 
02:41:44.750 --> 02:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
year is over $6
 
02:41:47.349 --> 02:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
million you compare that to the general
 
02:41:50.950 --> 02:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
fund of just under 5 5 million we
 
02:41:53.630 --> 02:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
actually make money for the general
 
02:41:55.790 --> 02:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
fund so
 
02:41:59.630 --> 02:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
we um take in more money than what you
 
02:42:01.950 --> 02:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
give us General funds so that makes it
 
02:42:03.429 --> 02:42:03.439 align:start position:0%
really difficult when we're asked to do
 
02:42:05.870 --> 02:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
budget cuts because we're a profit
 
02:42:09.269 --> 02:42:09.279 align:start position:0%
Center and of course if resources are
 
02:42:11.590 --> 02:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
taken from us it's more difficult for us
 
02:42:14.230 --> 02:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
to actually then produce that Revenue
 
02:42:15.870 --> 02:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
that you've asked us to
 
02:42:19.590 --> 02:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
produce um and with that unless there
 
02:42:22.750 --> 02:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
are any broad questions I'll uh yes
 
02:42:26.070 --> 02:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so um do the
 
02:42:30.150 --> 02:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
unrestrict do the other funds include uh
 
02:42:32.630 --> 02:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
um dedicated
 
02:42:36.990 --> 02:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
funds uh yes I believe they I believe
 
02:42:38.469 --> 02:42:38.479 align:start position:0%
they do I should have asked that
 
02:42:38.479 --> 02:42:39.590 align:start position:0%
they do I should have asked that
question

02:42:39.590 --> 02:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:42:42.429 --> 02:42:42.439 align:start position:0%
specifically um I don't know Josh do you
 
02:42:45.830 --> 02:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:48.630 --> 02:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
do uh one of the things that we did last
 
02:42:49.990 --> 02:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
term was
 
02:42:53.150 --> 02:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
uh shift more money from that was
 
02:42:56.550 --> 02:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
generated by income by fee income to a
 
02:42:58.349 --> 02:42:58.359 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund which is directly under
 
02:42:59.870 --> 02:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
the department rather than having to go
 
02:43:01.830 --> 02:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
through the general fund
 
02:43:03.550 --> 02:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
correct thank
 
02:43:07.110 --> 02:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
02:43:12.630 --> 02:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
sopus hello um is part of this um from
 
02:43:16.269 --> 02:43:16.279 align:start position:0%
animal food pet food a great deal of it
 
02:43:18.510 --> 02:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
is when director Wyman is up here he can
 
02:43:20.389 --> 02:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
speak more specifically to that thank
 
02:43:22.910 --> 02:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:43:27.790 --> 02:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
Penza do you have these just um um
 
02:43:30.870 --> 02:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
overview figures going back as well that
 
02:43:32.990 --> 02:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
would be easily accessible not like
 
02:43:34.510 --> 02:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
right the second but like that could be
 
02:43:36.110 --> 02:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
sent to the committee I think it would
 
02:43:38.590 --> 02:43:38.600 align:start position:0%
be helpful to see this over a period of
 
02:43:42.630 --> 02:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
time I do not have knowledge that we do
 
02:43:44.590 --> 02:43:44.600 align:start position:0%
I don't have knowledge that we don't
 
02:43:46.630 --> 02:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
when I get back I will see what we have
 
02:43:48.309 --> 02:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
available and see if we can send you
 
02:43:49.910 --> 02:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
that information great just to see a
 
02:43:52.349 --> 02:43:52.359 align:start position:0%
comparison over right I think we can we
 
02:43:54.150 --> 02:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
can pull that up certainly over the last
 
02:43:55.910 --> 02:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
five or six years should that' be great
 
02:43:57.790 --> 02:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
thank you should be easy to
 
02:44:03.590 --> 02:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
do what what where what portion of where
 
02:44:06.870 --> 02:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
and what portion of the funds go to fund
 
02:44:10.090 --> 02:44:10.100 align:start position:0%
the Diagnostic lab
 
02:44:10.100 --> 02:44:12.230 align:start position:0%
the Diagnostic lab
[Music]

02:44:12.230 --> 02:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:44:14.870 --> 02:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
so wasn't prepared for that
 
02:44:19.110 --> 02:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
question I think that there is an income
 
02:44:19.120 --> 02:44:20.150 align:start position:0%
question I think that there is an income
stream

02:44:20.150 --> 02:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
stream
 
02:44:23.870 --> 02:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
within um
 
02:44:26.750 --> 02:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
our I want to say it may come
 
02:44:29.349 --> 02:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
from dog licensing I'll get you a
 
02:44:31.230 --> 02:44:31.240 align:start position:0%
specific on that but it's not a general
 
02:44:33.910 --> 02:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
fund appropriation as I I recall but
 
02:44:36.030 --> 02:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
there is an appropriation and that is
 
02:44:37.870 --> 02:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
another thing that technically the
 
02:44:40.110 --> 02:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Agriculture has uh
 
02:44:42.349 --> 02:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
budgetary oversight over the Diagnostic
 
02:44:45.510 --> 02:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
lab at un yeah I I'm particularly
 
02:44:47.910 --> 02:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
interested to know for the money that's
 
02:44:50.269 --> 02:44:50.279 align:start position:0%
taken in
 
02:44:53.150 --> 02:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
where that money comes from and how that
 
02:44:57.870 --> 02:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
money funds the Diagnostic lab I I I
 
02:45:00.309 --> 02:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
believe we had I think in the past we
 
02:45:02.830 --> 02:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
had bills that came to our committee and
 
02:45:05.070 --> 02:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
it was indicated that um good portion of
 
02:45:08.750 --> 02:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
the dog licensing does go to fund the
 
02:45:11.269 --> 02:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
Diagnostic lab that is my
 
02:45:13.910 --> 02:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
recollection sorry go
 
02:45:17.670 --> 02:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
ahead yeah yeah okay uh representative K
 
02:45:20.030 --> 02:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you madam chair thank
 
02:45:23.389 --> 02:45:23.399 align:start position:0%
you commissioner for being here um and I
 
02:45:25.070 --> 02:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
know you don't probably do not have the
 
02:45:26.750 --> 02:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
answer on this but I'm just going to ask
 
02:45:29.790 --> 02:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
it to the entire department there um
 
02:45:31.630 --> 02:45:31.640 align:start position:0%
with other funds and it includes
 
02:45:34.670 --> 02:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds can we get a breakdown
 
02:45:37.950 --> 02:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
of the dedicated funds and what dollars
 
02:45:41.030 --> 02:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
are in those um so that we could see
 
02:45:42.630 --> 02:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
that certainly we do have we do have
 
02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:43.309 align:start position:0%
that certainly we do have we do have
that

02:45:43.309 --> 02:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:45:46.830 --> 02:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
information and um I will note on these
 
02:45:50.190 --> 02:45:50.200 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds that
 
02:45:52.309 --> 02:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
um we have made things more transparent
 
02:45:54.190 --> 02:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
part of that was through bill that you
 
02:45:58.550 --> 02:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
passed last year um the the amount of
 
02:46:02.269 --> 02:46:02.279 align:start position:0%
money in there um not huge we've pulled
 
02:46:04.070 --> 02:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
a lot out since I become commissioner
 
02:46:07.870 --> 02:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
for specific things and in general we
 
02:46:12.349 --> 02:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
anticipate that because of the shift in
 
02:46:13.990 --> 02:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
in funding and how we're funding it
 
02:46:17.150 --> 02:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
those numbers will continue to come down
 
02:46:20.910 --> 02:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
um about three budget ago I I said this
 
02:46:24.630 --> 02:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
is not sustainable to do it this way but
 
02:46:27.070 --> 02:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
because of what we've been asked um in
 
02:46:28.710 --> 02:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
the budget process we are pulling those
 
02:46:30.429 --> 02:46:30.439 align:start position:0%
down which I I think in general is
 
02:46:32.950 --> 02:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable but at some point the
 
02:46:35.870 --> 02:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
chickens will come home to roost and we
 
02:46:38.269 --> 02:46:38.279 align:start position:0%
may not have enough money depending on
 
02:46:40.150 --> 02:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
where our Revenue stream goes from I
 
02:46:41.670 --> 02:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
think we've done a pretty good job and
 
02:46:44.389 --> 02:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
things are working out pretty well but
 
02:46:47.150 --> 02:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
those those funds are being used to fund
 
02:46:50.190 --> 02:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
the programs um that the money comes in
 
02:46:54.269 --> 02:46:54.279 align:start position:0%
from uh and we are not building those
 
02:46:56.750 --> 02:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
those funds up any any longer which they
 
02:46:59.469 --> 02:46:59.479 align:start position:0%
were uh they had been previously
 
02:47:02.469 --> 02:47:02.479 align:start position:0%
followup yes Madam chair thank you
 
02:47:05.230 --> 02:47:05.240 align:start position:0%
um so I've been hearing stuff about the
 
02:47:07.670 --> 02:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
cost of care fund um because I'm
 
02:47:09.670 --> 02:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
assuming that is one of those dedicated
 
02:47:12.790 --> 02:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
funds um can you tell us where we stand
 
02:47:14.349 --> 02:47:14.359 align:start position:0%
with that is that fully funded at the
 
02:47:17.469 --> 02:47:17.479 align:start position:0%
moment or do we are we how that's thank
 
02:47:20.670 --> 02:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
you it's it's not fully funded um I
 
02:47:22.830 --> 02:47:22.840 align:start position:0%
think fully funded I think our our
 
02:47:26.269 --> 02:47:26.279 align:start position:0%
number we would hope to get it up into I
 
02:47:27.870 --> 02:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
don't remember what the mil the number
 
02:47:29.910 --> 02:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
is now but in the in the
 
02:47:33.910 --> 02:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
millions it is um well under a million
 
02:47:36.429 --> 02:47:36.439 align:start position:0%
right now I just had another small batch
 
02:47:39.910 --> 02:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
of requests come in but
 
02:47:43.190 --> 02:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um we will be putting very
 
02:47:44.469 --> 02:47:44.479 align:start position:0%
little into the fund in the next
 
02:47:47.230 --> 02:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
biennium because that's the first place
 
02:47:49.710 --> 02:47:49.720 align:start position:0%
any of our are funding the fair
 
02:47:53.110 --> 02:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
the funding for land purchases the the
 
02:47:57.950 --> 02:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
fund for uh fairs and the fund for um
 
02:48:01.070 --> 02:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
cost of care pulled those down to about
 
02:48:05.349 --> 02:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
$25,000 a year roughly 20 25,000 a year
 
02:48:07.429 --> 02:48:07.439 align:start position:0%
each uh and if we're asked to make
 
02:48:10.190 --> 02:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
further cuts um that'll be the next to
 
02:48:12.190 --> 02:48:12.200 align:start position:0%
go because I'm not going to to be
 
02:48:14.230 --> 02:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
funding these these things and laying
 
02:48:17.030 --> 02:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
off people we have a mission to do when
 
02:48:19.070 --> 02:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
it takes people to to accomplish that
 
02:48:21.349 --> 02:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
mission thank you very much I appreciate
 
02:48:22.870 --> 02:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
it thank
 
02:48:25.990 --> 02:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
you okay all right with that I will turn
 
02:48:29.030 --> 02:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
it over to director Russo from the
 
02:48:35.190 --> 02:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:37.670 --> 02:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
control good afternoon honorable members
 
02:48:38.990 --> 02:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
of the environment and agriculture
 
02:48:41.030 --> 02:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
committee I'm David rouso I see the
 
02:48:43.710 --> 02:48:43.720 align:start position:0%
division of pesticide control pesticide
 
02:48:45.309 --> 02:48:45.319 align:start position:0%
control being one of the divisions
 
02:48:46.510 --> 02:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
within the
 
02:48:51.510 --> 02:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:53.230 --> 02:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
I'll give you a quick overview of what
 
02:48:57.190 --> 02:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:59.550 --> 02:48:59.560 align:start position:0%
does bottom line is the protection of
 
02:49:02.269 --> 02:49:02.279 align:start position:0%
human health and the environment while
 
02:49:04.750 --> 02:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
recognizing the benefits of pesticides
 
02:49:06.389 --> 02:49:06.399 align:start position:0%
so there's a mission statement there but
 
02:49:08.190 --> 02:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
really the bottom line is to protect
 
02:49:10.030 --> 02:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
human health and the environment while
 
02:49:12.790 --> 02:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
recognizing the benefit of pesticides
 
02:49:14.030 --> 02:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
I'm proud to say that New Hampshire was
 
02:49:16.550 --> 02:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
one of the first state programs in
 
02:49:18.269 --> 02:49:18.279 align:start position:0%
regards to pesticide control in the
 
02:49:20.349 --> 02:49:20.359 align:start position:0%
nation we're talking about Roots back
 
02:49:23.229 --> 02:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
into the 1960s predate the Environmental
 
02:49:25.269 --> 02:49:25.279 align:start position:0%
Protection Agency at the federal level
 
02:49:26.229 --> 02:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
as well as the Department of
 
02:49:28.710 --> 02:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services so the department
 
02:49:30.389 --> 02:49:30.399 align:start position:0%
really jumped on board quickly with
 
02:49:32.429 --> 02:49:32.439 align:start position:0%
those with that manager protection of
 
02:49:34.349 --> 02:49:34.359 align:start position:0%
human health and the
 
02:49:36.269 --> 02:49:36.279 align:start position:0%
environment now I was thinking if I was
 
02:49:38.229 --> 02:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
sitting in your seat what would be
 
02:49:40.990 --> 02:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
helpful for me to remember the division
 
02:49:42.510 --> 02:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
of pesticide control so if there's one
 
02:49:44.389 --> 02:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
thing you could remember we have a
 
02:49:46.469 --> 02:49:46.479 align:start position:0%
licensing component so people that go on
 
02:49:48.710 --> 02:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
to someone else's property and use pesti
 
02:49:50.630 --> 02:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
decides they need to have a license
 
02:49:52.870 --> 02:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
there's an exam standard it's a written
 
02:49:54.309 --> 02:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
closed book exam so if there's one thing
 
02:49:56.349 --> 02:49:56.359 align:start position:0%
you can remember there is a license
 
02:49:58.349 --> 02:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
requirement for folks that go on to
 
02:49:59.429 --> 02:49:59.439 align:start position:0%
other people's property and use
 
02:50:01.269 --> 02:50:01.279 align:start position:0%
pesticides as well as private use of
 
02:50:03.389 --> 02:50:03.399 align:start position:0%
pesticides to create a commod commodity
 
02:50:05.630 --> 02:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
so agriculture so licensing then I
 
02:50:07.110 --> 02:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
thought well there's two things maybe
 
02:50:08.870 --> 02:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
there's two things not just one but
 
02:50:10.950 --> 02:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
there's product registration we register
 
02:50:13.110 --> 02:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
all products that are used as pesticides
 
02:50:15.750 --> 02:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
in the state um and that results in in a
 
02:50:18.710 --> 02:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund 75% of that goes to the
 
02:50:20.950 --> 02:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
general fund 25% stand stays in What's
 
02:50:22.830 --> 02:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
called the integrated Pest Management so
 
02:50:23.870 --> 02:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
just those two things if you remember
 
02:50:25.429 --> 02:50:25.439 align:start position:0%
two things just remember people have to
 
02:50:27.269 --> 02:50:27.279 align:start position:0%
be licensed exam requirement and and
 
02:50:28.790 --> 02:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
this product reg and then the third
 
02:50:30.750 --> 02:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
thing I think there ought to be a third
 
02:50:32.990 --> 02:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
one and that would be the enforcement
 
02:50:34.910 --> 02:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
piece so we actually have an enforcement
 
02:50:36.910 --> 02:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
team that goes out and makes sure that
 
02:50:38.429 --> 02:50:38.439 align:start position:0%
people that have a license are doing
 
02:50:40.750 --> 02:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
things properly as well as we respond to
 
02:50:44.190 --> 02:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
complaints okay so there's a licensing
 
02:50:46.429 --> 02:50:46.439 align:start position:0%
part there's a product registration part
 
02:50:47.950 --> 02:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
and there is the enforcement part and
 
02:50:48.990 --> 02:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
then the last thing I want you to
 
02:50:50.630 --> 02:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
remember we do some education and
 
02:50:52.910 --> 02:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
Outreach definitely uh the commissioner
 
02:50:54.150 --> 02:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned our partnership with the
 
02:50:55.590 --> 02:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire we actually
 
02:50:57.389 --> 02:50:57.399 align:start position:0%
met with them yesterday at the end of
 
02:50:59.349 --> 02:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
this month we'll do a number of training
 
02:51:01.469 --> 02:51:01.479 align:start position:0%
sessions for people that are interested
 
02:51:03.790 --> 02:51:03.800 align:start position:0%
in uh getting a license or folks that
 
02:51:05.790 --> 02:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
already have a license that need to
 
02:51:07.670 --> 02:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
maintain credits so you you maintain
 
02:51:09.830 --> 02:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
recertification credits to avoid taking
 
02:51:12.229 --> 02:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
the exam okay so that a nutshell is is
 
02:51:14.030 --> 02:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
is some of the activity we we we are
 
02:51:15.990 --> 02:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
involved with and how do we do this how
 
02:51:17.510 --> 02:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
many people do we use to do this we have
 
02:51:19.750 --> 02:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
eight folks fulltime
 
02:51:21.750 --> 02:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
um one uh two of them are pesticide
 
02:51:23.229 --> 02:51:23.239 align:start position:0%
inspectors and you got a great bang for
 
02:51:24.910 --> 02:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
your buck with two inspectors in the
 
02:51:26.710 --> 02:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
state I'll get to the numbers later on
 
02:51:29.870 --> 02:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
it's how many inspections they do um we
 
02:51:33.229 --> 02:51:33.239 align:start position:0%
have an environmental program four out
 
02:51:36.670 --> 02:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
of the eight uh employees are carry the
 
02:51:38.349 --> 02:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
environmentalist title and I think
 
02:51:39.670 --> 02:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
that's important for the type of work we
 
02:51:41.469 --> 02:51:41.479 align:start position:0%
do we're talking about chemicals in the
 
02:51:44.269 --> 02:51:44.279 align:start position:0%
environment um five of the eight folks
 
02:51:45.830 --> 02:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
in the division actually have
 
02:51:48.190 --> 02:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
environmental degrees so either it's a
 
02:51:50.429 --> 02:51:50.439 align:start position:0%
wildlife biology natural resource
 
02:51:52.590 --> 02:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
protection environmental planning so
 
02:51:54.510 --> 02:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
we're we're really focused an
 
02:51:57.429 --> 02:51:57.439 align:start position:0%
environmental concern focused group um
 
02:51:59.389 --> 02:51:59.399 align:start position:0%
we have one certification coordinator
 
02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
that manages the licensing
 
02:52:03.550 --> 02:52:03.560 align:start position:0%
piece we have one individual that does
 
02:52:04.590 --> 02:52:04.600 align:start position:0%
the product
 
02:52:06.910 --> 02:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
registration we have a program assistant
 
02:52:08.750 --> 02:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
now don't let that title fool you that
 
02:52:10.830 --> 02:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
person actually has two degrees one in
 
02:52:13.990 --> 02:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
natural resources and one in vet tech so
 
02:52:15.870 --> 02:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
um well qualified individuals with an i
 
02:52:16.990 --> 02:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
Division and then and then this the
 
02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:18.870 align:start position:0%
Division and then and then this the
director

02:52:18.870 --> 02:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
director
 
02:52:20.229 --> 02:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
I could just quickly go through some of
 
02:52:22.389 --> 02:52:22.399 align:start position:0%
our major programs from last year I mean
 
02:52:24.229 --> 02:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh deliverables from last year based on
 
02:52:25.309 --> 02:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
our major
 
02:52:28.309 --> 02:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
programs the licensing we issued 2600
 
02:52:30.429 --> 02:52:30.439 align:start position:0%
licenses most of those are what we call
 
02:52:32.309 --> 02:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
Commercial and that's the people that go
 
02:52:33.630 --> 02:52:33.640 align:start position:0%
on other people's property so there's
 
02:52:35.630 --> 02:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
about 2200 of those licens that are
 
02:52:38.110 --> 02:52:38.120 align:start position:0%
issued the others are the agricultural
 
02:52:40.670 --> 02:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
type so about four just just under
 
02:52:40.680 --> 02:52:42.870 align:start position:0%
type so about four just just under
500

02:52:42.870 --> 02:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
500
 
02:52:45.110 --> 02:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
um and the education and Outreach
 
02:52:46.910 --> 02:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
component is part of that licensing
 
02:52:49.150 --> 02:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
program uh the product registration
 
02:52:52.429 --> 02:52:52.439 align:start position:0%
piece we registered 13,000 products last
 
02:52:53.990 --> 02:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
year and again that's one individual
 
02:52:55.670 --> 02:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
taking care of that program and
 
02:52:57.870 --> 02:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
fortunately as a uh as a nation we work
 
02:53:00.070 --> 02:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
closely together with other states so
 
02:53:01.710 --> 02:53:01.720 align:start position:0%
where we only have one person doing
 
02:53:02.950 --> 02:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
product registration there may be a
 
02:53:05.150 --> 02:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
larger state that has a whole staff
 
02:53:06.590 --> 02:53:06.600 align:start position:0%
focused on that so if there's a problem
 
02:53:08.469 --> 02:53:08.479 align:start position:0%
with a pesticide we usually hear about
 
02:53:10.269 --> 02:53:10.279 align:start position:0%
it quickly and that's an important piece
 
02:53:12.670 --> 02:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
to the program uh so product
 
02:53:15.030 --> 02:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
registration again compliance Assurance
 
02:53:17.550 --> 02:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
which is our enforcement we had two
 
02:53:19.469 --> 02:53:19.479 align:start position:0%
inspectors in the field last year over
 
02:53:21.910 --> 02:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
600 inspections which is a good number
 
02:53:24.510 --> 02:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
they also um in addition to doing random
 
02:53:26.590 --> 02:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
checks so they'll show up if someone's
 
02:53:28.030 --> 02:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
about ready to use a pesticide they'll
 
02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
do what we call the use observation
 
02:53:31.269 --> 02:53:31.279 align:start position:0%
they're taking notes they're checking
 
02:53:33.469 --> 02:53:33.479 align:start position:0%
licenses making things sure things are
 
02:53:34.950 --> 02:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
done properly and they also respond to
 
02:53:37.110 --> 02:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
complaints so the inspections are done
 
02:53:38.990 --> 02:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
mostly for random checks on folks with
 
02:53:42.309 --> 02:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
licenses but we also respond to
 
02:53:44.309 --> 02:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
complaints as far as Environmental
 
02:53:44.319 --> 02:53:45.349 align:start position:0%
complaints as far as Environmental
Protection

02:53:45.349 --> 02:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
Protection
 
02:53:47.870 --> 02:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
goes we spend a lot of time with water
 
02:53:50.190 --> 02:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
quality resource protection and there's
 
02:53:51.670 --> 02:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
a thing called special permits that
 
02:53:53.150 --> 02:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
these license holders will need for
 
02:53:54.550 --> 02:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
certain work that they do I'll give you
 
02:53:57.710 --> 02:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
an example sometimes W uh water is in is
 
02:53:59.670 --> 02:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
a situation where a pesticide might be
 
02:54:01.790 --> 02:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
used in water to control weeds so that
 
02:54:03.990 --> 02:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
would require a special permit very
 
02:54:05.830 --> 02:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
involved very heavily regulated we want
 
02:54:07.190 --> 02:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
to know who's doing it how they're doing
 
02:54:09.150 --> 02:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
it what they're using what time of day
 
02:54:10.510 --> 02:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
they're doing it give us a chance to
 
02:54:12.830 --> 02:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
inspect if needed we sample water so the
 
02:54:15.070 --> 02:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
environmental piece is really important
 
02:54:16.950 --> 02:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh there's also setback requirements for
 
02:54:18.630 --> 02:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
people that use pesticides and if they
 
02:54:20.110 --> 02:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
want to get within that setback they
 
02:54:21.710 --> 02:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
would need a special permit if we'd
 
02:54:24.110 --> 02:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
allow it at all um so Environmental
 
02:54:25.910 --> 02:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
Protection really important and then the
 
02:54:27.550 --> 02:54:27.560 align:start position:0%
last program I wanted to mention is the
 
02:54:29.710 --> 02:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
integrated Pest Management program if
 
02:54:31.190 --> 02:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
you're not familiar with that as the
 
02:54:32.950 --> 02:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
name implies integrated we're
 
02:54:34.670 --> 02:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
integrating a number of methods to
 
02:54:36.710 --> 02:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
control a pest so it's not just the
 
02:54:38.630 --> 02:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
pesticide it might be a mechanical
 
02:54:41.469 --> 02:54:41.479 align:start position:0%
approach it might be a cultural approach
 
02:54:44.870 --> 02:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
but it's it's the it's an activity uh to
 
02:54:47.910 --> 02:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
address a pest other than just one using
 
02:54:50.389 --> 02:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
one me method so we do have some money
 
02:54:52.349 --> 02:54:52.359 align:start position:0%
into that program and we issue about six
 
02:54:56.070 --> 02:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
four to six grants a year um and I could
 
02:54:57.070 --> 02:54:57.080 align:start position:0%
I could get carried away with that I got
 
02:54:58.389 --> 02:54:58.399 align:start position:0%
to move the page quickly or I'll go
 
02:55:02.229 --> 02:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
director um so pesticides includes
 
02:55:04.389 --> 02:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
herbicides correct yeah I should have I
 
02:55:05.990 --> 02:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
should have given you a definition right
 
02:55:08.030 --> 02:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
off right off it is in the statute and
 
02:55:09.990 --> 02:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
the rules a pesticide is really a
 
02:55:11.910 --> 02:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
chemical and it could be organic or a
 
02:55:13.630 --> 02:55:13.640 align:start position:0%
combination of chemicals used to control
 
02:55:16.309 --> 02:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
a pest under that umbrella of pesticides
 
02:55:18.070 --> 02:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
you have herbicides which would be for
 
02:55:19.750 --> 02:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
PL plants you have insecticides for
 
02:55:22.070 --> 02:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
insects fungicides for fungus and on and
 
02:55:24.110 --> 02:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
on and on so pesticide would be the
 
02:55:26.670 --> 02:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
umbrella term herbicide does go
 
02:55:28.510 --> 02:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
underneath that that and that's part of
 
02:55:30.630 --> 02:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
our regulation thank
 
02:55:33.349 --> 02:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
you um and yeah last couple things I
 
02:55:35.269 --> 02:55:35.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention was we do partner with
 
02:55:36.910 --> 02:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
other state agencies we work closely
 
02:55:38.229 --> 02:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
with Department of Environmental
 
02:55:41.309 --> 02:55:41.319 align:start position:0%
Services Fish and Game Transportation
 
02:55:43.670 --> 02:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
natural cult cultural resources and as I
 
02:55:45.790 --> 02:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned the university um and we work
 
02:55:46.870 --> 02:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
really closely with the federal
 
02:55:48.309 --> 02:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
government especially the Environmental
 
02:55:50.070 --> 02:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
Protection Agency the the national
 
02:55:52.750 --> 02:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
umbrella law is is at the federal level
 
02:55:54.550 --> 02:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
and they support about 40% of our
 
02:55:55.790 --> 02:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
program so we work closely with the
 
02:55:57.750 --> 02:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Agency as well
 
02:55:59.070 --> 02:55:59.080 align:start position:0%
as the United States Department of
 
02:56:01.590 --> 02:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
Agriculture now the board um we have a
 
02:56:03.309 --> 02:56:03.319 align:start position:0%
pesticide control board is it's a by
 
02:56:04.910 --> 02:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
Statute of 13 member board and they
 
02:56:08.030 --> 02:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
oversee the regulations and the policies
 
02:56:10.469 --> 02:56:10.479 align:start position:0%
of the division and that's really all I
 
02:56:12.429 --> 02:56:12.439 align:start position:0%
have unless is are there any vacancies
 
02:56:14.710 --> 02:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
on that board right now yes there are
 
02:56:18.630 --> 02:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
how many uh four
 
02:56:20.990 --> 02:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
and those are made via appointment by
 
02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:22.070 align:start position:0%

coming in your presentation I just had a
 
02:56:43.269 --> 02:56:43.279 align:start position:0%
question about the 2600 licenses so
 
02:56:46.110 --> 02:56:46.120 align:start position:0%
let's say if I own um a pesticide
 
02:56:48.389 --> 02:56:48.399 align:start position:0%
business and I have you know 100
 
02:56:50.670 --> 02:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
employees is that included in there like
 
02:56:52.110 --> 02:56:52.120 align:start position:0%
the licenses for each one of those
 
02:56:54.269 --> 02:56:54.279 align:start position:0%
individual people that are going out and
 
02:56:56.830 --> 02:56:56.840 align:start position:0%
and applicating product yes that's
 
02:56:58.550 --> 02:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
02:57:02.150 --> 02:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
yeah representative com thank you madam
 
02:57:04.190 --> 02:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for being here how
 
02:57:06.830 --> 02:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
are you um
 
02:57:11.469 --> 02:57:11.479 align:start position:0%
so just for folks to understand and on
 
02:57:15.469 --> 02:57:15.479 align:start position:0%
the individual or say
 
02:57:18.710 --> 02:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
um pesticide licenses if you're on
 
02:57:24.269 --> 02:57:24.279 align:start position:0%
Farm if you're selling your produce to a
 
02:57:26.750 --> 02:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
consumer and you're using either an
 
02:57:30.710 --> 02:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
organic or non-organic chemical are you
 
02:57:33.710 --> 02:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
required to have a license yes the way
 
02:57:36.830 --> 02:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
the the law identifies the use of
 
02:57:39.030 --> 02:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
chemical and chemical includes organic
 
02:57:43.229 --> 02:57:43.239 align:start position:0%
correct um so you would need a a per a
 
02:57:45.590 --> 02:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
pesticide permit to use organic
 
02:57:47.110 --> 02:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
materials to raise if you're if you're
 
02:57:49.389 --> 02:57:49.399 align:start position:0%
using that material to control a pest
 
02:57:51.070 --> 02:57:51.080 align:start position:0%
that would require a
 
02:57:55.630 --> 02:57:55.640 align:start position:0%
permit thank you uh thank you for that
 
02:57:57.309 --> 02:57:57.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yeah I just wanted
 
02:57:59.870 --> 02:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
to uh ask that because I think it's
 
02:58:02.950 --> 02:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
important for everyone to understand um
 
02:58:06.950 --> 02:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
how our license works and also the fact
 
02:58:09.190 --> 02:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
that there's an annual reporting so
 
02:58:11.670 --> 02:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
you're keeping track of how many how
 
02:58:13.750 --> 02:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
what pesticides have been used in wear
 
02:58:15.630 --> 02:58:15.640 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes part of the license
 
02:58:17.710 --> 02:58:17.720 align:start position:0%
requirement to maintain is to report
 
02:58:20.190 --> 02:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
annually what you use that year one more
 
02:58:23.550 --> 02:58:23.560 align:start position:0%
okay one more thank you madam chair and
 
02:58:25.670 --> 02:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
um does the pesticide control board in
 
02:58:28.349 --> 02:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have the right to not
 
02:58:31.269 --> 02:58:31.279 align:start position:0%
allow a pesticide into New Hampshire
 
02:58:33.590 --> 02:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
even if it's federally approved yes
 
02:58:37.030 --> 02:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative
 
02:58:39.710 --> 02:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
Penza representative Conan now just open
 
02:58:43.150 --> 02:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
up a whole can of question worm so no um
 
02:58:45.790 --> 02:58:45.800 align:start position:0%
okay so I have to to understand
 
02:58:49.110 --> 02:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
this for you to be able to
 
02:58:52.590 --> 02:58:52.600 align:start position:0%
you know um apply any sort of pesticides
 
02:58:54.670 --> 02:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
on your property Farm or something like
 
02:58:57.269 --> 02:58:57.279 align:start position:0%
that you have to have a license if the
 
02:58:59.070 --> 02:58:59.080 align:start position:0%
commodity is is being sold or
 
02:59:02.630 --> 02:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
distributed okay so are there so for
 
02:59:04.630 --> 02:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
example if you if you're working for a
 
02:59:07.190 --> 02:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
company that does this does everyone
 
02:59:10.070 --> 02:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
that is applying have to have a license
 
02:59:12.429 --> 02:59:12.439 align:start position:0%
in that situation no the one person
 
02:59:14.190 --> 02:59:14.200 align:start position:0%
would be required to have the license
 
02:59:15.870 --> 02:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
and be in direct contact with the
 
02:59:17.590 --> 02:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
individuals using it if if the choice
 
02:59:20.309 --> 02:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
was to let people apply the pesticide
 
02:59:22.830 --> 02:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
under that one license but they would
 
02:59:25.190 --> 02:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
probably be on site like supervising
 
02:59:29.070 --> 02:59:29.080 align:start position:0%
corre okay um I think that's it okay
 
02:59:31.309 --> 02:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you madam
 
02:59:33.950 --> 02:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
chair thank you director um do you buy a
 
02:59:36.510 --> 02:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
chance have an idea of what percentage
 
02:59:40.030 --> 02:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
of pesticides are herbicides fungicides
 
02:59:42.590 --> 02:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
and insecticides roughly not off the top
 
02:59:44.110 --> 02:59:44.120 align:start position:0%
of my head but I could I could get you
 
02:59:46.389 --> 02:59:46.399 align:start position:0%
that information yeah yeah
 
02:59:49.550 --> 02:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby Okay so so um if
 
02:59:52.070 --> 02:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a
 
02:59:54.790 --> 02:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
pest uh a pest control
 
02:59:58.710 --> 02:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
company uh would there be one one
 
03:00:01.389 --> 03:00:01.399 align:start position:0%
licensing level for the management of
 
03:00:04.510 --> 03:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
the company and then the the employees
 
03:00:05.830 --> 03:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
who are actually going out in the field
 
03:00:07.630 --> 03:00:07.640 align:start position:0%
would have a different level of
 
03:00:11.229 --> 03:00:11.239 align:start position:0%
license correct every business entity as
 
03:00:14.429 --> 03:00:14.439 align:start position:0%
we call them commercial business entity
 
03:00:16.150 --> 03:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
requires at least one individual to have
 
03:00:18.070 --> 03:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
a supervisory level licensees the and
 
03:00:20.070 --> 03:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's an advanced level license then
 
03:00:22.550 --> 03:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
under that supervisory they can add an
 
03:00:25.190 --> 03:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
operational level both supervisory and
 
03:00:26.750 --> 03:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
operational are required to take the
 
03:00:29.349 --> 03:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
written exam the supervisory is held to
 
03:00:31.990 --> 03:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
a standard of what's called an oral exam
 
03:00:34.790 --> 03:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
so after that supervisory candidate
 
03:00:36.910 --> 03:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
passes the written test they sit before
 
03:00:40.349 --> 03:00:40.359 align:start position:0%
a panel um of individuals to to to allow
 
03:00:42.750 --> 03:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
that supervisory license to be
 
03:00:45.030 --> 03:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
satisfied and just a little bit of
 
03:00:46.750 --> 03:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
clarification in terms of the
 
03:00:50.710 --> 03:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
Agricultural and things you said that uh
 
03:00:52.150 --> 03:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
not everyone would actually have to have
 
03:00:53.750 --> 03:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
a license who was applying things if
 
03:00:56.550 --> 03:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
they were underneath the management of a
 
03:00:59.590 --> 03:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh someone who had a supervisory license
 
03:01:01.630 --> 03:01:01.640 align:start position:0%
the private is different the
 
03:01:03.750 --> 03:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
agricultural piece is there's no oral
 
03:01:06.910 --> 03:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
exam requirement there is a written Clos
 
03:01:08.950 --> 03:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
book exam for folks that use restricted
 
03:01:11.030 --> 03:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
use products or what's called worker
 
03:01:13.269 --> 03:01:13.279 align:start position:0%
protection standard type products we're
 
03:01:15.190 --> 03:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
getting into the Weeds now sorry but
 
03:01:17.469 --> 03:01:17.479 align:start position:0%
they could be they they could be on site
 
03:01:18.590 --> 03:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
and have some that doesn't have a
 
03:01:20.110 --> 03:01:20.120 align:start position:0%
license but they need to work together
 
03:01:22.030 --> 03:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
so the responsibility Falls to that
 
03:01:23.269 --> 03:01:23.279 align:start position:0%
license holder in the in the
 
03:01:24.990 --> 03:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
agricultural example okay thank you
 
03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:26.389 align:start position:0%
agricultural example okay thank you
representative

03:01:26.389 --> 03:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:01:29.070 --> 03:01:29.080 align:start position:0%
Scully thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:01:31.750 --> 03:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
you for coming to testify um what is the
 
03:01:34.150 --> 03:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
period of um how long is a license valid
 
03:01:37.349 --> 03:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
for and does that 2600 number include
 
03:01:38.630 --> 03:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
people who are being
 
03:01:42.670 --> 03:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
relicensed um after a license expires
 
03:01:45.710 --> 03:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
great so the license is good for five
 
03:01:49.030 --> 03:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
years as long as you renew annually so
 
03:01:50.710 --> 03:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
you're submitting what you used for that
 
03:01:52.790 --> 03:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
year you're asking for the license for
 
03:01:55.309 --> 03:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
the second year you have five years to
 
03:01:56.710 --> 03:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
accumulate a certain number of credits
 
03:01:58.630 --> 03:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
to avoid the exam so you're on a
 
03:02:00.630 --> 03:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
fiveyear cycle but you have to renew it
 
03:02:04.550 --> 03:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
annually and the 2600 would be uh I I
 
03:02:06.630 --> 03:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
would have to um go back and find out
 
03:02:08.150 --> 03:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
how many of those are new versus how
 
03:02:12.269 --> 03:02:12.279 align:start position:0%
many are are renewing okay thank you
 
03:02:12.279 --> 03:02:14.830 align:start position:0%
many are are renewing okay thank you
thanks

03:02:14.830 --> 03:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:23.309 --> 03:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:25.110 --> 03:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
03:02:26.750 --> 03:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
again for the record my name is Rebecca
 
03:02:29.150 --> 03:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
Ross I'm the director of agricultural
 
03:02:31.110 --> 03:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
development and I've been in this
 
03:02:34.590 --> 03:02:34.600 align:start position:0%
position since August so bear with me I
 
03:02:36.349 --> 03:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
don't have the experience that the
 
03:02:38.830 --> 03:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner and David have with their
 
03:02:40.790 --> 03:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
program areas but we'll we'll try to get
 
03:02:43.670 --> 03:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
through it for everybody um so unlike
 
03:02:46.269 --> 03:02:46.279 align:start position:0%
the other divisions in the division of a
 
03:02:49.030 --> 03:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
development we're not a regular atory
 
03:02:51.229 --> 03:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
division we're sort of the everything
 
03:02:54.030 --> 03:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
else when it comes to connecting um
 
03:02:58.229 --> 03:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
producers and consumers and supporting
 
03:03:00.710 --> 03:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
the egg industry in New
 
03:03:04.349 --> 03:03:04.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so our mission is to create
 
03:03:06.630 --> 03:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
Market development opportunities that
 
03:03:08.910 --> 03:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
result in increased sales for
 
03:03:11.630 --> 03:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
producers um provide information to the
 
03:03:14.710 --> 03:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
public and inform the public of the
 
03:03:16.830 --> 03:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
value and diversity of the state's
 
03:03:19.429 --> 03:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
agricultural herit and Industry so not
 
03:03:21.630 --> 03:03:21.640 align:start position:0%
only what you can buy today but what
 
03:03:25.150 --> 03:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
value it provides to our state whether
 
03:03:28.429 --> 03:03:28.439 align:start position:0%
it's travel and tourism land protection
 
03:03:29.990 --> 03:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
all of those things that make New
 
03:03:31.630 --> 03:03:31.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire because of its
 
03:03:34.429 --> 03:03:34.439 align:start position:0%
Rich agricultural history in order to do
 
03:03:36.950 --> 03:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
that our core functions include
 
03:03:39.110 --> 03:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
administering a number of different
 
03:03:41.870 --> 03:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
federal grants that support producers
 
03:03:43.990 --> 03:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
and the folks that are also supporting
 
03:03:46.790 --> 03:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
producers whether it's trade Industries
 
03:03:49.110 --> 03:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
or the folks at un doing research that
 
03:03:51.070 --> 03:03:51.080 align:start position:0%
will support that continued production
 
03:03:53.349 --> 03:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um our office also
 
03:03:55.229 --> 03:03:55.239 align:start position:0%
supports public
 
03:03:57.870 --> 03:03:57.880 align:start position:0%
inquiries um and we produce and
 
03:03:59.790 --> 03:03:59.800 align:start position:0%
disseminate information and directories
 
03:04:02.389 --> 03:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
we're shifting for efficiency purposes
 
03:04:05.870 --> 03:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
to doing a lot of that online and having
 
03:04:08.550 --> 03:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
links to directories that can be updated
 
03:04:11.070 --> 03:04:11.080 align:start position:0%
more than once of once a year and not
 
03:04:13.790 --> 03:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
printing things that we then have to
 
03:04:16.630 --> 03:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
dispose of and reprint as soon as there
 
03:04:18.550 --> 03:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
are a couple of changes so we're trying
 
03:04:21.030 --> 03:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
to do that as efficiently as possible
 
03:04:23.550 --> 03:04:23.560 align:start position:0%
but we know people want to just Google
 
03:04:26.469 --> 03:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
where do I find this near me and have
 
03:04:27.910 --> 03:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
that information and we're working with
 
03:04:30.630 --> 03:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
Partners to make sure that's available
 
03:04:34.389 --> 03:04:34.399 align:start position:0%
um we also manage the states building at
 
03:04:36.229 --> 03:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
the Big E which is New Hampshire
 
03:04:38.750 --> 03:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
property that we own in Massachusetts as
 
03:04:41.950 --> 03:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
well as participate in other events and
 
03:04:45.150 --> 03:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
fairs and Expos to promote Agriculture
 
03:04:47.830 --> 03:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
and the folks working in agriculture we
 
03:04:50.870 --> 03:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
have three and a half um full-time
 
03:04:53.950 --> 03:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
employees or three and a half FTE
 
03:04:56.950 --> 03:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
including my position as the Director
 
03:04:58.429 --> 03:04:58.439 align:start position:0%
one person who supports our weekly
 
03:05:00.910 --> 03:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
Market Bulletin which is our publication
 
03:05:02.910 --> 03:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
with eg information that goes out
 
03:05:05.870 --> 03:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
Statewide to subscribers um one person
 
03:05:10.309 --> 03:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
who manages reception and banking issues
 
03:05:13.469 --> 03:05:13.479 align:start position:0%
deposits um and is really the the face
 
03:05:15.590 --> 03:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture who supports all of the
 
03:05:17.469 --> 03:05:17.479 align:start position:0%
divisions as we have individuals walking
 
03:05:18.990 --> 03:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
in and asking questions and trying to
 
03:05:21.550 --> 03:05:21.560 align:start position:0%
get information um and an information
 
03:05:23.030 --> 03:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative which is a part-time
 
03:05:25.070 --> 03:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
position that helps us put together
 
03:05:27.190 --> 03:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
those directories support our online
 
03:05:30.710 --> 03:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
presence and support um our our grants
 
03:05:34.229 --> 03:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
in different programs throughout the
 
03:05:36.990 --> 03:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
division um specifically the specialty
 
03:05:39.349 --> 03:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
crop block grants from USDA are a huge
 
03:05:42.269 --> 03:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
part of our work um this past year we
 
03:05:44.790 --> 03:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
were managing 24 different projects each
 
03:05:47.630 --> 03:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
year we get a new allocation that we put
 
03:05:49.950 --> 03:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
put out in a competitive process for
 
03:05:51.750 --> 03:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
people supporting agriculture it does
 
03:05:55.349 --> 03:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
not go to individual producers and have
 
03:05:57.870 --> 03:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
a few projects that are supported um
 
03:06:02.190 --> 03:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
which go three plus years so throughout
 
03:06:04.309 --> 03:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
the course of any Year we're supporting
 
03:06:07.309 --> 03:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
20 to 25 projects although they're each
 
03:06:09.590 --> 03:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
from different years that overlap so
 
03:06:12.070 --> 03:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's how we get to the TW total of 24
 
03:06:16.950 --> 03:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
projects um those uh will be coming up
 
03:06:20.670 --> 03:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
again in a couple months for the next
 
03:06:23.389 --> 03:06:23.399 align:start position:0%
2025 allocation and the next bidding
 
03:06:25.670 --> 03:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
process for those projects the other
 
03:06:27.469 --> 03:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
large programs that are a little bit
 
03:06:29.550 --> 03:06:29.560 align:start position:0%
newer and haven't been going on as long
 
03:06:32.229 --> 03:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
are local food to schools and local food
 
03:06:34.070 --> 03:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
purchase assistance both of which are
 
03:06:35.950 --> 03:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
being reup by the feds the dollar
 
03:06:38.309 --> 03:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
amounts for those programs um in the
 
03:06:41.550 --> 03:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
coming years are in those slides for the
 
03:06:43.429 --> 03:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
local food to schools program they're
 
03:06:46.269 --> 03:06:46.279 align:start position:0%
also adding a component that will go to
 
03:06:49.429 --> 03:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
early childhood to help ensure um the
 
03:06:51.469 --> 03:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
institutions that are serving and
 
03:06:54.790 --> 03:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
supporting our kids during the day have
 
03:06:57.830 --> 03:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
support and connections to buy um
 
03:06:59.870 --> 03:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
healthy foods from local producers so
 
03:07:01.710 --> 03:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
we're seeing another three years for
 
03:07:04.790 --> 03:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
that program we partner with the food
 
03:07:07.590 --> 03:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
bank on the local F food purchase
 
03:07:09.790 --> 03:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
assistance program which is also being
 
03:07:12.710 --> 03:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
reup for another three years so if the
 
03:07:14.990 --> 03:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
federal funding for those programs goes
 
03:07:17.990 --> 03:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
away the program goes away yes yes
 
03:07:20.750 --> 03:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
exactly so um they were both new
 
03:07:23.550 --> 03:07:23.560 align:start position:0%
programs a few years ago and up until
 
03:07:25.750 --> 03:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
last month it wasn't 100% that we would
 
03:07:29.190 --> 03:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
see another round we have seen the the
 
03:07:32.309 --> 03:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
notices um that they give us the
 
03:07:34.469 --> 03:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to apply to participate for
 
03:07:36.229 --> 03:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
another three years thank you
 
03:07:36.239 --> 03:07:38.510 align:start position:0%
another three years thank you

03:07:57.950 --> 03:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
so it these are not to individual
 
03:07:59.790 --> 03:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
producers they're either to
 
03:08:01.269 --> 03:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
organizations well they're to
 
03:08:02.790 --> 03:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
organizations that are supporting
 
03:08:04.750 --> 03:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
agriculture it maybe a Trade
 
03:08:07.030 --> 03:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
Organization um last year one of the
 
03:08:09.910 --> 03:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
awards was to the New Hampshire
 
03:08:11.910 --> 03:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
Beekeepers Association where they will
 
03:08:14.510 --> 03:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
then be doing subg grants to 10
 
03:08:16.710 --> 03:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
different um entities throughout the
 
03:08:19.830 --> 03:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
state to promote good practices and
 
03:08:22.670 --> 03:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
education within their communities um we
 
03:08:25.790 --> 03:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
send usually there's each round there's
 
03:08:30.429 --> 03:08:30.439 align:start position:0%
a couple to researchers as well so there
 
03:08:33.510 --> 03:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
is one project right now looking at
 
03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
researching um older strawberry
 
03:08:37.429 --> 03:08:37.439 align:start position:0%
varieties and bringing back some of
 
03:08:40.389 --> 03:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
those healthy genes that will thrive in
 
03:08:42.309 --> 03:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
the environment that we have now so it's
 
03:08:44.950 --> 03:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
either research or promotion on a
 
03:08:46.750 --> 03:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide level versus an individual
 
03:08:46.760 --> 03:08:48.710 align:start position:0%
Statewide level versus an individual
producer

03:08:48.710 --> 03:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
producer
 
03:08:52.429 --> 03:08:52.439 align:start position:0%
than you followup yeah y thank you again
 
03:08:55.429 --> 03:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
um what a what an organization like fa
 
03:08:57.630 --> 03:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
FFA be a organization that would get
 
03:09:01.190 --> 03:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
some of this grant money um we fund FFA
 
03:09:02.870 --> 03:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
with some other money if they had a
 
03:09:05.349 --> 03:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
project that was going to promote and
 
03:09:06.950 --> 03:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
meet the standards to promote specialty
 
03:09:08.309 --> 03:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
crops that
 
03:09:10.830 --> 03:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
USDA puts forth they could certainly
 
03:09:13.349 --> 03:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
apply and and be in the running for that
 
03:09:14.910 --> 03:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
historically in the last few years we
 
03:09:17.990 --> 03:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
have not seen that thank you
 
03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:19.229 align:start position:0%
have not seen that thank you
go

03:09:19.229 --> 03:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
go
 
03:09:22.389 --> 03:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
ahead oh representative Bixby had a
 
03:09:25.710 --> 03:09:25.720 align:start position:0%
question so uh I get the Market Bulletin
 
03:09:27.389 --> 03:09:27.399 align:start position:0%
I've been getting it pretty much since I
 
03:09:29.790 --> 03:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
joined this was a me started on this
 
03:09:31.990 --> 03:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
committee I was wondering is that
 
03:09:34.750 --> 03:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
something that you automatically put on
 
03:09:37.790 --> 03:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh on the email for all of the members
 
03:09:39.990 --> 03:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
of this committee and if it's if it
 
03:09:42.469 --> 03:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
isn't now could that be become the
 
03:09:45.710 --> 03:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
case yes you so you're asking if if we
 
03:09:47.830 --> 03:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
can have the entire membership on the
 
03:09:49.630 --> 03:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
Market Bulletin subscription list by
 
03:09:52.190 --> 03:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
email yes we will do that thank you
 
03:09:52.200 --> 03:09:53.190 align:start position:0%
email yes we will do that thank you
thank

03:09:53.190 --> 03:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:09:53.200 --> 03:09:56.469 align:start position:0%
thank
you

03:09:56.469 --> 03:09:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:59.870 --> 03:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
okay all right so in addition to the
 
03:10:02.349 --> 03:10:02.359 align:start position:0%
grant work that we do um that is really
 
03:10:04.469 --> 03:10:04.479 align:start position:0%
focused Statewide we do have the
 
03:10:06.750 --> 03:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
individual initiatives that we're
 
03:10:08.950 --> 03:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
involved with including the Big E if
 
03:10:11.389 --> 03:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
you're not familiar with the big e um it
 
03:10:14.070 --> 03:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
is a Fair in Springfield Massachusetts
 
03:10:16.590 --> 03:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
that had that runs for 17 days is one of
 
03:10:19.590 --> 03:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
the largest fairs in the country um way
 
03:10:24.670 --> 03:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
back when the um promoter or developer
 
03:10:26.990 --> 03:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
of the Big E thought it was important to
 
03:10:28.710 --> 03:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
promote all of the New England states so
 
03:10:30.030 --> 03:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
each of the New England states owns
 
03:10:32.389 --> 03:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
property in a building to sh showcase
 
03:10:35.429 --> 03:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
their own State at that fair we own a
 
03:10:39.590 --> 03:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
building that um was open for the 17
 
03:10:41.910 --> 03:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
days of the fair last year the the foot
 
03:10:44.229 --> 03:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
traffic during those 17 days was
 
03:10:46.870 --> 03:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
1.6 million people we have a large
 
03:10:49.429 --> 03:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
partnership ship with travel and tourism
 
03:10:52.309 --> 03:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
and um the New Hampshire ambassadors
 
03:10:54.269 --> 03:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
that are down there talking to all of
 
03:10:55.870 --> 03:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
those guests that are coming through our
 
03:10:58.910 --> 03:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
building we also had 22 booths with 17
 
03:11:00.630 --> 03:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
different vendors there's one day
 
03:11:02.269 --> 03:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
dedicated to each state and on New
 
03:11:05.349 --> 03:11:05.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire day we also had um six
 
03:11:07.349 --> 03:11:07.359 align:start position:0%
performer six performances by three
 
03:11:09.229 --> 03:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
different groups and additional
 
03:11:12.429 --> 03:11:12.439 align:start position:0%
exhibitors showing their trades or
 
03:11:14.670 --> 03:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
products um so we're looking to always
 
03:11:16.070 --> 03:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
build up how we're promoting New
 
03:11:17.670 --> 03:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire through the new New England
 
03:11:21.389 --> 03:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
states um which directly connects to our
 
03:11:23.469 --> 03:11:23.479 align:start position:0%
our travel and tourism in support of
 
03:11:25.269 --> 03:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
Agriculture as those folks are coming to
 
03:11:28.550 --> 03:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
visit our state um we also support the
 
03:11:32.309 --> 03:11:32.319 align:start position:0%
form Farm forest and garden expo which
 
03:11:33.950 --> 03:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
has shifted from being in downtown
 
03:11:36.070 --> 03:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester to the Deerfield fa
 
03:11:38.229 --> 03:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
Fairgrounds to have much more of an
 
03:11:41.550 --> 03:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
agricultural uh feel and to be um in
 
03:11:43.510 --> 03:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
that outside environment to give better
 
03:11:45.590 --> 03:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities to to Showcase that
 
03:11:49.429 --> 03:11:49.439 align:start position:0%
agriculture handson um the last large
 
03:11:52.269 --> 03:11:52.279 align:start position:0%
part of our division's work is really um
 
03:11:54.349 --> 03:11:54.359 align:start position:0%
all of the Publications and promotions
 
03:11:56.190 --> 03:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's using some of that Grant
 
03:11:59.389 --> 03:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
fund to partner with the ad agencies
 
03:12:00.750 --> 03:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
that we work with to promote those
 
03:12:03.790 --> 03:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
specialty crops um producing The Market
 
03:12:05.750 --> 03:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
Bulletin updating our website and
 
03:12:08.150 --> 03:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
directories and working with other
 
03:12:12.190 --> 03:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
contractors on TV radio and online ads
 
03:12:14.790 --> 03:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
reminding people of the value of
 
03:12:17.229 --> 03:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and where to find it here
 
03:12:18.790 --> 03:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire each year we're looking to
 
03:12:22.590 --> 03:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
update that and sort of refresh those
 
03:12:24.269 --> 03:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
this particular Year we're also starting
 
03:12:26.910 --> 03:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
a contract to do some branding and
 
03:12:30.950 --> 03:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
create a logo for local New Hampshire
 
03:12:32.590 --> 03:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
products just like many other states
 
03:12:33.950 --> 03:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
have done so you'll see that coming out
 
03:12:36.150 --> 03:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
in the next few months okay so this
 
03:12:38.670 --> 03:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
might be a very weird question I'll
 
03:12:40.950 --> 03:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
throw it out to you as well as the
 
03:12:43.110 --> 03:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner does your
 
03:12:45.910 --> 03:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
department division of agricultural
 
03:12:45.920 --> 03:12:47.429 align:start position:0%
department division of agricultural
development

03:12:47.429 --> 03:12:47.439 align:start position:0%
development
 
03:12:50.550 --> 03:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
have any kind of metrics to do to
 
03:12:54.030 --> 03:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
determine the success of the work that
 
03:12:57.110 --> 03:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
you're doing and other words are you
 
03:12:59.070 --> 03:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
measuring how many new Farms are
 
03:13:02.389 --> 03:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
established or how many people that you
 
03:13:05.990 --> 03:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
reach during a given year or something
 
03:13:10.150 --> 03:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
like that do you have metrics that
 
03:13:13.510 --> 03:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
determine your division's
 
03:13:15.830 --> 03:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
success that's a great question and was
 
03:13:18.110 --> 03:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
one of my first questions when I came
 
03:13:20.190 --> 03:13:20.200 align:start position:0%
over here and those are hard things to
 
03:13:21.550 --> 03:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
measure we have some more on an
 
03:13:23.950 --> 03:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
individual level so we have a lot of
 
03:13:27.510 --> 03:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
USDA data and statistics we have
 
03:13:29.590 --> 03:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
individual metrics in the different
 
03:13:34.349 --> 03:13:34.359 align:start position:0%
grants um we have reports from the
 
03:13:35.750 --> 03:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
contractors that are doing some of the
 
03:13:38.950 --> 03:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
advertising on number of hits number of
 
03:13:41.630 --> 03:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
sort of not only did they view it but
 
03:13:44.190 --> 03:13:44.200 align:start position:0%
did they engage so number of engagements
 
03:13:47.309 --> 03:13:47.319 align:start position:0%
so we can we can see how much activity
 
03:13:49.309 --> 03:13:49.319 align:start position:0%
is on a lot of our external things what
 
03:13:51.110 --> 03:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
we haven't been able to do is see it on
 
03:13:52.870 --> 03:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
our own website which is a bit of a
 
03:13:54.830 --> 03:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
challenge we are in the process of
 
03:13:57.269 --> 03:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
revamping the department's website as
 
03:13:59.910 --> 03:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
well we're drafting all of those pages
 
03:14:02.790 --> 03:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
now that will give us better metrics on
 
03:14:04.950 --> 03:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
who's looking for What on our website
 
03:14:06.710 --> 03:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
and who is engaging which I think will
 
03:14:10.190 --> 03:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
be very helpful um and then we're we're
 
03:14:13.790 --> 03:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
always looking to to have surveys to
 
03:14:16.750 --> 03:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
partner with UNH and and other partners
 
03:14:18.950 --> 03:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
the operative extensions and the
 
03:14:21.389 --> 03:14:21.399 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions on their
 
03:14:24.309 --> 03:14:24.319 align:start position:0%
numbers but being careful not to over
 
03:14:26.309 --> 03:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
assume on causal connections too right
 
03:14:28.630 --> 03:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
we have a great campaign we have five
 
03:14:30.590 --> 03:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
more Farms we don't know that our
 
03:14:33.190 --> 03:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
campaign or a certain program really had
 
03:14:35.190 --> 03:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
anything to do with influencing that we
 
03:14:38.030 --> 03:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
have five more Farms or we don't so I
 
03:14:40.110 --> 03:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
think it's a little bit more narrow but
 
03:14:41.990 --> 03:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's certainly a focus of mind to make
 
03:14:44.830 --> 03:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
sure that what we're doing is Statewide
 
03:14:47.910 --> 03:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
is true to the mission and that we can
 
03:14:50.710 --> 03:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
show those outcomes because you know we
 
03:14:54.150 --> 03:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
all recognize the value of educating the
 
03:14:57.990 --> 03:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
public in um how important agriculture
 
03:15:01.469 --> 03:15:01.479 align:start position:0%
is to New Hampshire but I think we also
 
03:15:02.750 --> 03:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
need to
 
03:15:07.309 --> 03:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
know how well we are doing in trying to
 
03:15:10.429 --> 03:15:10.439 align:start position:0%
get more Farms established and going and
 
03:15:13.990 --> 03:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
becoming successful because more Farms
 
03:15:17.309 --> 03:15:17.319 align:start position:0%
we have the better I believe anyway two
 
03:15:19.590 --> 03:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
cents as a farmer I would agree I think
 
03:15:22.389 --> 03:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
we're also you know going to be looking
 
03:15:24.670 --> 03:15:24.680 align:start position:0%
at what other states are looking at and
 
03:15:26.670 --> 03:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
not necessarily do we have more but are
 
03:15:28.830 --> 03:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
we not losing because we are losing
 
03:15:30.950 --> 03:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
dairy farms we are losing a land and we
 
03:15:33.950 --> 03:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
are losing producers and so sometimes
 
03:15:36.750 --> 03:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
the status quo is the positive metric
 
03:15:38.750 --> 03:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
because we haven't shifted back
 
03:15:42.510 --> 03:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
especially in the higher density areas
 
03:15:44.349 --> 03:15:44.359 align:start position:0%
um so looking at what we can do to make
 
03:15:47.309 --> 03:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
sure that we continue to support what we
 
03:15:49.790 --> 03:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
have and take measures to gain I so are
 
03:15:51.910 --> 03:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
you doing any kind of reports or studies
 
03:15:54.750 --> 03:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
to show why we are losing farmlands or
 
03:15:58.950 --> 03:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
da Farms or why we are not successful in
 
03:16:01.670 --> 03:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
any one particular aspect of agriculture
 
03:16:04.910 --> 03:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
in the state um our division is not
 
03:16:07.710 --> 03:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
supporting any specifically right now I
 
03:16:08.830 --> 03:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
think i' look to Josh and the
 
03:16:10.070 --> 03:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner about what we've done in
 
03:16:11.910 --> 03:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
the past I know there have been studies
 
03:16:14.070 --> 03:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
that have been done every every few
 
03:16:17.229 --> 03:16:17.239 align:start position:0%
years um but it's certainly on our radar
 
03:16:18.429 --> 03:16:18.439 align:start position:0%
to make sure we're looking at that going
 
03:16:21.389 --> 03:16:21.399 align:start position:0%
forward thank you any other questions
 
03:16:23.670 --> 03:16:23.680 align:start position:0%

Public Health and the economy uh that's
 
03:18:14.910 --> 03:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
important because the emphasis is on
 
03:18:16.990 --> 03:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
infectious and contagious diseases
 
03:18:18.950 --> 03:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
particularly so diseases that are
 
03:18:21.870 --> 03:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
communicable between animals and can
 
03:18:24.429 --> 03:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
spread among our state and damage our
 
03:18:26.590 --> 03:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
state's economy our state's animal
 
03:18:28.750 --> 03:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
industry and cause public health
 
03:18:30.790 --> 03:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
problems that is different than a
 
03:18:32.870 --> 03:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
disease that might be say a birth defect
 
03:18:34.469 --> 03:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
if your puppy was born with a crooked
 
03:18:36.309 --> 03:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
tail or if your cow was born with
 
03:18:37.590 --> 03:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
something abnormal that's not going to
 
03:18:40.110 --> 03:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
be contagious or risk anybody's economy
 
03:18:41.950 --> 03:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
or public health so it's important to
 
03:18:44.110 --> 03:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
remember that component of our mission
 
03:18:46.269 --> 03:18:46.279 align:start position:0%
and we we do experience challenges with
 
03:18:48.189 --> 03:18:48.199 align:start position:0%
that uh every day in terms of people
 
03:18:50.150 --> 03:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
trying to understand what that means
 
03:18:52.429 --> 03:18:52.439 align:start position:0%
infectious and contagious um so how do
 
03:18:54.830 --> 03:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
we do that uh we have several core
 
03:18:57.630 --> 03:18:57.640 align:start position:0%
functions that we pursue so we conduct
 
03:18:59.710 --> 03:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
investigations of animal disease
 
03:19:02.750 --> 03:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
outbreaks on farms and in certain uh
 
03:19:04.990 --> 03:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
licensed facilities basically anytime
 
03:19:06.349 --> 03:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
there's an outbreak or an appearance
 
03:19:08.070 --> 03:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
that there may be disease present that's
 
03:19:10.830 --> 03:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
where we get called um to livestock
 
03:19:13.469 --> 03:19:13.479 align:start position:0%
facilities and uh any kind of facility
 
03:19:15.710 --> 03:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
that would potentially affect our our
 
03:19:17.950 --> 03:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
food our public Public Health our Farms
 
03:19:19.750 --> 03:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
as we've just been discussing and
 
03:19:22.670 --> 03:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes even our pets uh we run lots
 
03:19:25.510 --> 03:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
of Diagnostics both routinely uh when
 
03:19:27.229 --> 03:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
there are not outbreaks happening so
 
03:19:29.469 --> 03:19:29.479 align:start position:0%
what we call Peace time uh we run lots
 
03:19:31.389 --> 03:19:31.399 align:start position:0%
of Diagnostics throughout the state on a
 
03:19:33.870 --> 03:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
regular basis a voluntary basis among
 
03:19:36.590 --> 03:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
many of our Farms our poultry producers
 
03:19:38.630 --> 03:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
our livestock producers and sometimes
 
03:19:41.790 --> 03:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
even our pet producers um that may be
 
03:19:44.790 --> 03:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
just disease management um watching for
 
03:19:47.990 --> 03:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis or brucelosis uh it may be
 
03:19:50.830 --> 03:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
um assisting to transport or test uh for
 
03:19:53.349 --> 03:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
rabies another very important disease in
 
03:19:55.510 --> 03:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
the state but we do have the capability
 
03:19:57.150 --> 03:19:57.160 align:start position:0%
to run a lot of Diagnostics and we do
 
03:19:59.309 --> 03:19:59.319 align:start position:0%
that in conjunction with the uh New
 
03:20:01.269 --> 03:20:01.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire veterinary Diagnostic lab uh
 
03:20:03.070 --> 03:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
we communicate regularly with our state
 
03:20:06.670 --> 03:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
EOC because often times large
 
03:20:09.469 --> 03:20:09.479 align:start position:0%
animal large scale animal emergencies
 
03:20:11.590 --> 03:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
can become human emergencies and
 
03:20:13.269 --> 03:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes large scale human emergencies
 
03:20:15.710 --> 03:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
can also become animal emergencies uh so
 
03:20:17.790 --> 03:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
we work with them regularly on response
 
03:20:20.990 --> 03:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
plans um everything from uh potential
 
03:20:23.229 --> 03:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
situations say with a seab brick nucle
 
03:20:25.309 --> 03:20:25.319 align:start position:0%
nuclear power plant to the introduction
 
03:20:27.070 --> 03:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
of a foreign animal disease something
 
03:20:29.910 --> 03:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
very highly contagious um to the
 
03:20:31.950 --> 03:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
introduction of a disease that would be
 
03:20:34.189 --> 03:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
significantly zoonatic and risk uh the
 
03:20:36.349 --> 03:20:36.359 align:start position:0%
human population we work with the EOC
 
03:20:38.349 --> 03:20:38.359 align:start position:0%
regularly on practicing and managing
 
03:20:40.950 --> 03:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
plans like that um and most importantly
 
03:20:42.189 --> 03:20:42.199 align:start position:0%
probably the most common thing we do is
 
03:20:45.150 --> 03:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
we regulate and oversee animal movement
 
03:20:47.349 --> 03:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
so for myself as a veteran Arian coming
 
03:20:49.189 --> 03:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
from 177 years of practice where I
 
03:20:51.510 --> 03:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
worked on fixing the individual animal
 
03:20:53.870 --> 03:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
or the herd with the problem uh it's a
 
03:20:55.070 --> 03:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
different kind of work because we
 
03:20:57.110 --> 03:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
monitor the movement we make sure the
 
03:20:58.630 --> 03:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
animals have the appropriate regulatory
 
03:21:00.990 --> 03:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
paperwork to cross state lines or to
 
03:21:03.349 --> 03:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
even move within our state we make sure
 
03:21:05.389 --> 03:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
they have the appropriate required legal
 
03:21:08.030 --> 03:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
um the testing required to move and we
 
03:21:09.950 --> 03:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
make sure especially if there's a change
 
03:21:12.670 --> 03:21:12.680 align:start position:0%
in ownership of an animal a transfer of
 
03:21:14.590 --> 03:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
an animal that that appropriate
 
03:21:16.309 --> 03:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
paperwork uh comes as well because the
 
03:21:18.309 --> 03:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
person and purchasing the animal uh may
 
03:21:20.630 --> 03:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
not uh have all the background um we do
 
03:21:22.349 --> 03:21:22.359 align:start position:0%
a lot with animal population we have the
 
03:21:24.429 --> 03:21:24.439 align:start position:0%
animal population control program which
 
03:21:26.550 --> 03:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
I'll talk about in a second and within
 
03:21:28.630 --> 03:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
our division we have nine full-time
 
03:21:30.790 --> 03:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
employees we have the state veterinarian
 
03:21:32.229 --> 03:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
we have myself the assistant State
 
03:21:34.670 --> 03:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
veterinarian we have four animal health
 
03:21:36.590 --> 03:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
technicians essentially Veterinary
 
03:21:39.269 --> 03:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
technicians doing regulatory work so we
 
03:21:41.429 --> 03:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
call them animal health technicians we
 
03:21:43.710 --> 03:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
have a full-time disease data management
 
03:21:46.150 --> 03:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
entry person and our office manager and
 
03:21:48.510 --> 03:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
the a PCP the man animal population
 
03:21:51.790 --> 03:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
control Pro program overseer so next
 
03:21:54.710 --> 03:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
slide so how do we do Disease Control we
 
03:21:55.950 --> 03:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
I talked about Disease Control is the
 
03:21:57.349 --> 03:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
most important thing we do how do we do
 
03:21:59.590 --> 03:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
that we do that with the authority
 
03:22:02.229 --> 03:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
provided in RSA 436 and some of other
 
03:22:05.030 --> 03:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
statutes and we typically will conduct
 
03:22:06.910 --> 03:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
testing and
 
03:22:09.309 --> 03:22:09.319 align:start position:0%
investigations in so far as available
 
03:22:12.189 --> 03:22:12.199 align:start position:0%
funds permit but also in so far as the
 
03:22:13.910 --> 03:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
reason to believe that that disease may
 
03:22:16.349 --> 03:22:16.359 align:start position:0%
exist there so we do not just go around
 
03:22:18.670 --> 03:22:18.680 align:start position:0%
the the state looking for diseases
 
03:22:21.309 --> 03:22:21.319 align:start position:0%
except for our routine um Disease
 
03:22:22.790 --> 03:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
Control programs that we have for
 
03:22:24.229 --> 03:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
diseases that we know we are under
 
03:22:26.429 --> 03:22:26.439 align:start position:0%
constant threat of and our animals are
 
03:22:28.309 --> 03:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
um we don't go barging into people's
 
03:22:30.070 --> 03:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
property just trying to find a disease
 
03:22:31.229 --> 03:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
there we need to have a reason to
 
03:22:33.070 --> 03:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
believe that it's there based on our
 
03:22:35.070 --> 03:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
fellow colleagues other agencies or
 
03:22:37.590 --> 03:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
animal symptoms and signs notifications
 
03:22:39.670 --> 03:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
from veterinarians local law enforcement
 
03:22:42.349 --> 03:22:42.359 align:start position:0%
things like that um so that's how we do
 
03:22:43.830 --> 03:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
that that's the authority under which we
 
03:22:48.389 --> 03:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
do that um why zootic disease zuntic
 
03:22:51.070 --> 03:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
disease means a disease that is
 
03:22:54.110 --> 03:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
transferred from an animal to a human
 
03:22:55.429 --> 03:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
and so just to let you know the
 
03:22:59.389 --> 03:22:59.399 align:start position:0%
importance of that term 61% of all germs
 
03:23:02.110 --> 03:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
that we know as humans all the germs uh
 
03:23:04.309 --> 03:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
that humans can catch 61% of those are
 
03:23:05.830 --> 03:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
zoonotic meaning that they can be
 
03:23:08.910 --> 03:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
transferred from animals to people
 
03:23:11.950 --> 03:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
75% of all the emerging zoonotic disease
 
03:23:13.429 --> 03:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
outbreaks right now in the world that
 
03:23:15.429 --> 03:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
means new diseases that we're trying to
 
03:23:17.790 --> 03:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
figure out study and understand create
 
03:23:20.750 --> 03:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines for 75% of those new ones are
 
03:23:22.910 --> 03:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
zoonotic they're related to animals or
 
03:23:25.269 --> 03:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
animal transmission to people and lastly
 
03:23:26.630 --> 03:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
the most important statistic in the
 
03:23:29.309 --> 03:23:29.319 align:start position:0%
United States seven out of 10 American
 
03:23:31.950 --> 03:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
households have pets or livestock or
 
03:23:33.309 --> 03:23:33.319 align:start position:0%
animals right in their immediate
 
03:23:36.150 --> 03:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
vicinity um so that's the importance of
 
03:23:37.870 --> 03:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
why we regulate Animal Health a lot of
 
03:23:39.590 --> 03:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
people fail to realize that the main
 
03:23:41.670 --> 03:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
purpose is to protect human
 
03:23:45.030 --> 03:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
health um so obviously overseeing food
 
03:23:48.309 --> 03:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
safety food security regulatory costs
 
03:23:50.070 --> 03:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
and taxpayer implications anytime
 
03:23:52.229 --> 03:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
there's an animal outbreak or a disease
 
03:23:53.910 --> 03:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
or anytime we even have to conduct an
 
03:23:56.110 --> 03:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
animal disease Trace back to try to
 
03:23:57.550 --> 03:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
figure out if there's a disease or an
 
03:23:59.870 --> 03:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
outbreak happening that all costs money
 
03:24:02.910 --> 03:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
and takes time and a lot of resources um
 
03:24:04.910 --> 03:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
and then the disposal event and
 
03:24:06.630 --> 03:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
controlling and biocurity after an
 
03:24:08.309 --> 03:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
outbreak is important and that's that's
 
03:24:09.670 --> 03:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
all the reasons why it's important we
 
03:24:11.710 --> 03:24:11.720 align:start position:0%
regulate Animal Health um we have
 
03:24:14.469 --> 03:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
regular programs for rabies tuberculosis
 
03:24:17.309 --> 03:24:17.319 align:start position:0%
salmonella avien influenza mic plasma
 
03:24:20.429 --> 03:24:20.439 align:start position:0%
brucelosis Scrapy um and a numerous uh
 
03:24:22.510 --> 03:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
numerous other diseases those are all
 
03:24:24.510 --> 03:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
regularly monitored diseases that we
 
03:24:26.110 --> 03:24:26.120 align:start position:0%
look for to try to prevent them from
 
03:24:28.229 --> 03:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
building up in our herds in the state of
 
03:24:29.910 --> 03:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so do you work in
 
03:24:32.550 --> 03:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
conjunction with fishing gam so they
 
03:24:35.389 --> 03:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
come across a moose and that's deceased
 
03:24:37.990 --> 03:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
and they do they contact you to try and
 
03:24:40.110 --> 03:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
figure out why it died or that's a great
 
03:24:41.910 --> 03:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
question that exact example you
 
03:24:44.510 --> 03:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned a moose maybe not so much
 
03:24:46.429 --> 03:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
unless it was found on a dairy herd or
 
03:24:49.150 --> 03:24:49.160 align:start position:0%
is found in relation to uh one of our
 
03:24:52.070 --> 03:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
livestock animals however um a wild uh
 
03:24:54.590 --> 03:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
Canadian goose or uh uh if there
 
03:24:56.790 --> 03:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
certainly was a wild pig a feral hog
 
03:24:58.630 --> 03:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
found or something in relation to our
 
03:25:00.790 --> 03:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
farms uh something that is known to have
 
03:25:03.550 --> 03:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
a direct infectious agent that we 100%
 
03:25:05.229 --> 03:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
know is high-risk to our dairy farms and
 
03:25:07.189 --> 03:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
our swine Farms we would absolutely be
 
03:25:08.870 --> 03:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
involved with fishing game we we
 
03:25:11.110 --> 03:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
communicate regularly with fishing game
 
03:25:13.830 --> 03:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
we don't do a lot too much with moose uh
 
03:25:15.630 --> 03:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
we we do have some things we do with
 
03:25:17.790 --> 03:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
servid the the term served means deer or
 
03:25:20.429 --> 03:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
elk or Caribou um but yes we do
 
03:25:22.590 --> 03:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
regularly work with uh USDA and uh
 
03:25:25.510 --> 03:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
fishing game um USDA wildlife services
 
03:25:27.469 --> 03:25:27.479 align:start position:0%
another Wildlife uh component that we
 
03:25:29.389 --> 03:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
work with a lot regularly especially
 
03:25:32.269 --> 03:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
here in conquer so for example if if I
 
03:25:34.710 --> 03:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
have a constituent who found a dead
 
03:25:37.110 --> 03:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
turkey wild turkey on their property yes
 
03:25:38.910 --> 03:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
and maybe they've got you know flock of
 
03:25:41.070 --> 03:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
chickens or something nearby or whatever
 
03:25:42.990 --> 03:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
should they call your office that's a
 
03:25:44.389 --> 03:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
real that's a real situation that
 
03:25:46.469 --> 03:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
happens quite a bit actually because the
 
03:25:48.510 --> 03:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
turkey is wild they first should call
 
03:25:50.229 --> 03:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
fishing game they absolutely first
 
03:25:52.189 --> 03:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
should call fishing game and fish and
 
03:25:54.269 --> 03:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
game will communicate with them about uh
 
03:25:55.750 --> 03:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
collect whether that bird is a
 
03:25:57.550 --> 03:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
considered a suspect bird or high enough
 
03:26:00.030 --> 03:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
risk bird to test because we find
 
03:26:03.189 --> 03:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
Wildlife all the time a dead bat uh dead
 
03:26:05.389 --> 03:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
turkey that kind of thing the fishing
 
03:26:07.670 --> 03:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
game has thresholds that they set and a
 
03:26:09.670 --> 03:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
whole entire decision algorithm for when
 
03:26:10.990 --> 03:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
the risk is high enough that they need
 
03:26:12.590 --> 03:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
to intervene because we do find wild
 
03:26:14.630 --> 03:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
animals quite a bit sometimes just the
 
03:26:16.630 --> 03:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
one off and it doesn't always mean
 
03:26:18.110 --> 03:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
something might be happening in terms of
 
03:26:20.070 --> 03:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
an infectious disease so they should
 
03:26:22.189 --> 03:26:22.199 align:start position:0%
first Contact fishing game fishing game
 
03:26:24.070 --> 03:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
would then assess do their algorithm and
 
03:26:26.269 --> 03:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
discussion with them and call us uh
 
03:26:28.309 --> 03:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
which happens sometimes if exactly the
 
03:26:29.870 --> 03:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
parameters you just mentioned happen
 
03:26:31.710 --> 03:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
like there's a susceptible flock of
 
03:26:33.870 --> 03:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
poultry nearby maybe there's more than
 
03:26:35.830 --> 03:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
one dead turkey maybe two or three dead
 
03:26:38.110 --> 03:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
in the neighborhood um so yes it's
 
03:26:39.750 --> 03:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
possible we'd get called but the first
 
03:26:41.750 --> 03:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
if it's a wild animal the first call
 
03:26:43.990 --> 03:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
should go to fish and game if it's a
 
03:26:46.429 --> 03:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
domestic bird of course should go to us
 
03:26:48.189 --> 03:26:48.199 align:start position:0%
to what extent does your department or
 
03:26:48.199 --> 03:26:49.269 align:start position:0%
to what extent does your department or
fishing

03:26:49.269 --> 03:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
fishing
 
03:26:52.950 --> 03:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
game um educate the public in how to go
 
03:26:55.349 --> 03:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
about doing that that's a great question
 
03:26:58.110 --> 03:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
we we um we have Flyers out there we
 
03:27:00.630 --> 03:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
have a um our decision-making algorithm
 
03:27:02.830 --> 03:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
for that what we use um to determine for
 
03:27:04.429 --> 03:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
example if an animal might be at risk
 
03:27:07.110 --> 03:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
for rabies we get calls all the time I
 
03:27:09.309 --> 03:27:09.319 align:start position:0%
found a dead rat in my basement could my
 
03:27:11.349 --> 03:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
cat or dog be getting rabies from this
 
03:27:14.189 --> 03:27:14.199 align:start position:0%
or I found a a dead bat in my house that
 
03:27:15.830 --> 03:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
my cat was playing with do I need to
 
03:27:18.590 --> 03:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
worry about rabies that the the
 
03:27:20.309 --> 03:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
decision-making process we use comes
 
03:27:21.990 --> 03:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
from statute it's spelled out in laws
 
03:27:24.429 --> 03:27:24.439 align:start position:0%
and rules and we actually use our
 
03:27:26.150 --> 03:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
decision-making algorithm we've kind of
 
03:27:27.710 --> 03:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
published it into a flyer and we make
 
03:27:29.510 --> 03:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
that public so we will share that with
 
03:27:32.710 --> 03:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
law enforcement ACO or even the public
 
03:27:35.110 --> 03:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
um W Wildlife has the same thing very
 
03:27:37.269 --> 03:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
similar algorithms and there's not only
 
03:27:38.990 --> 03:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
a hotline you can call it all the time
 
03:27:42.429 --> 03:27:42.439 align:start position:0%
but posters and um public messaging
 
03:27:44.590 --> 03:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
especially amongst an outbreak if we
 
03:27:46.229 --> 03:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
start having an outbreak of West Al
 
03:27:48.150 --> 03:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
virus or highly pathogenic Aven
 
03:27:49.550 --> 03:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
influenza which I'll talk about in a
 
03:27:52.070 --> 03:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
second we we do release materials not
 
03:27:55.309 --> 03:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
only on our website um but uh kind of
 
03:27:56.910 --> 03:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
these little Flyers that we make in
 
03:27:58.110 --> 03:27:58.120 align:start position:0%
conjunction with New Hampshire
 
03:27:59.790 --> 03:27:59.800 align:start position:0%
veterinary Diagnostic lab wildlife
 
03:28:03.389 --> 03:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
services and other agencies thank you um
 
03:28:05.910 --> 03:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
so moving on to Disease Control so we
 
03:28:08.070 --> 03:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
work regularly with the uh Veterinary
 
03:28:10.150 --> 03:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
Diagnostic lab It's a Wonderful team
 
03:28:12.830 --> 03:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
over there of very smart Veterinary
 
03:28:14.510 --> 03:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
Pathologists a lot smarter than I'll
 
03:28:17.070 --> 03:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
ever be and a team of people that are
 
03:28:19.229 --> 03:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
experts in animal disease and diagnostic
 
03:28:21.269 --> 03:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
testing we work with them regularly
 
03:28:22.870 --> 03:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
bringing them samples we communicate
 
03:28:24.469 --> 03:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
with them regularly about results that
 
03:28:26.469 --> 03:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
we get uh for animals that are submitted
 
03:28:28.790 --> 03:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
for disease testing uh like I mentioned
 
03:28:31.110 --> 03:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
we communicate regularly with our
 
03:28:33.429 --> 03:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
Emergency Operations Center and the
 
03:28:35.910 --> 03:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
Emergency Operations people that will
 
03:28:38.469 --> 03:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
essentially be overseeing uh response if
 
03:28:40.870 --> 03:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
we have a state emergency uh involving
 
03:28:44.590 --> 03:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
animal disease um and we uh you'll see
 
03:28:46.269 --> 03:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
on the third bar there under disease
 
03:28:48.590 --> 03:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
control we regulate livestock dealers
 
03:28:50.510 --> 03:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
poultry dealers and Swine garbage
 
03:28:52.990 --> 03:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
feeders regularly all the time we are
 
03:28:54.910 --> 03:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
going and doing those inspections for
 
03:28:56.830 --> 03:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
those here who don't know garbage
 
03:28:58.630 --> 03:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
feeding of swine the term garbage
 
03:29:00.510 --> 03:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
feeding doesn't mean feeding garbage
 
03:29:02.790 --> 03:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
from your kitchen garbage or whatever uh
 
03:29:04.349 --> 03:29:04.359 align:start position:0%
or from your local dumpster it means
 
03:29:06.910 --> 03:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
feeding a certain type of food left over
 
03:29:10.309 --> 03:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
from Human processes uh to swine
 
03:29:12.950 --> 03:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
typically produce and and the term
 
03:29:15.110 --> 03:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
garbage is defined not only federally
 
03:29:16.750 --> 03:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
but here in the state
 
03:29:18.990 --> 03:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
and um it's important to understand that
 
03:29:21.189 --> 03:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
you cannot include meat products or any
 
03:29:23.750 --> 03:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
kind of high-risk products for swine uh
 
03:29:25.910 --> 03:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
to feed back to your your pigs that is a
 
03:29:29.469 --> 03:29:29.479 align:start position:0%
high-risk um um pattern of behavior that
 
03:29:30.790 --> 03:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of people do they just give all
 
03:29:32.670 --> 03:29:32.680 align:start position:0%
their scraps to their pigs and it turns
 
03:29:34.070 --> 03:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
out that that is one of the greatest
 
03:29:36.070 --> 03:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
risk factors for African swine fever
 
03:29:37.710 --> 03:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
classical swine fever foot and mouth
 
03:29:39.590 --> 03:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
disease and some other diseases they're
 
03:29:41.870 --> 03:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
always trying to creep into our nation
 
03:29:43.950 --> 03:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
um so we do regulate and oversee garbage
 
03:29:46.670 --> 03:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
feeding yeah quick question too um the
 
03:29:48.429 --> 03:29:48.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire veterinary diagnostic
 
03:29:50.469 --> 03:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
laboratory is in joint management with
 
03:29:53.429 --> 03:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
UNH do they share the funding to fund
 
03:29:56.910 --> 03:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
that uh facility uh their facility or
 
03:30:01.830 --> 03:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
the programs yes and yes um they you
 
03:30:03.030 --> 03:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
mean with the Department with our
 
03:30:03.040 --> 03:30:04.910 align:start position:0%
mean with the Department with our
department

03:30:04.910 --> 03:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:30:07.510 --> 03:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
yeah the commissioner might yeah it
 
03:30:09.830 --> 03:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
there is I think the answer to that is
 
03:30:13.510 --> 03:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
yes um there the funding for some of
 
03:30:16.830 --> 03:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
their programs comes from some of the
 
03:30:18.990 --> 03:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
same funding that our programs come from
 
03:30:20.790 --> 03:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
I believe I I I can't give you a
 
03:30:22.110 --> 03:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
complete answer on that maybe
 
03:30:25.150 --> 03:30:25.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper I didn't hear the
 
03:30:28.630 --> 03:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
question okay questions sorry it's not
 
03:30:30.150 --> 03:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
um I might have to get back to you on
 
03:30:31.750 --> 03:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
03:30:34.510 --> 03:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
sorry um moving on so we just got a new
 
03:30:36.630 --> 03:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
electronic data management system it's a
 
03:30:38.910 --> 03:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
big deal in our division it's a $1.3
 
03:30:41.070 --> 03:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
million project over four years we just
 
03:30:43.510 --> 03:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
released we just had our starting uh
 
03:30:45.469 --> 03:30:45.479 align:start position:0%
mandatory date for veterinarians to use
 
03:30:47.750 --> 03:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
that starting on January 6th uh thank
 
03:30:49.469 --> 03:30:49.479 align:start position:0%
you to those here who helped make that
 
03:30:51.790 --> 03:30:51.800 align:start position:0%
possible uh we were doing just paperwork
 
03:30:54.229 --> 03:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
and and and cabinets and lots of paper
 
03:30:56.110 --> 03:30:56.120 align:start position:0%
records instead of electronic records so
 
03:30:57.950 --> 03:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
now we can monitor dog and cap movements
 
03:31:00.910 --> 03:31:00.920 align:start position:0%
and transfers electronically search make
 
03:31:03.070 --> 03:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
reports it's much much easier and it's
 
03:31:05.030 --> 03:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
also daunting we're now realizing the
 
03:31:07.630 --> 03:31:07.640 align:start position:0%
number of cats and dogs that move in our
 
03:31:09.429 --> 03:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
state and are transferred it's
 
03:31:11.150 --> 03:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
exponentially more than any of us ever
 
03:31:14.269 --> 03:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
thought um so uh moving on uh we
 
03:31:15.910 --> 03:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
regulate the pet trade the pet trade is
 
03:31:17.110 --> 03:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
is the elephant in the room that
 
03:31:19.229 --> 03:31:19.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper was mentioning uh
 
03:31:22.189 --> 03:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
it's it really is becoming a challenge
 
03:31:24.510 --> 03:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
as we try to help dairy farms and pig
 
03:31:26.870 --> 03:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
farms and animal livestock operations
 
03:31:29.229 --> 03:31:29.239 align:start position:0%
and over 50% of our time is being taken
 
03:31:31.630 --> 03:31:31.640 align:start position:0%
up by monitoring dog and cat Movement we
 
03:31:33.550 --> 03:31:33.560 align:start position:0%
just don't have the staff it's important
 
03:31:36.150 --> 03:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
work but we we do not have nearly the
 
03:31:38.269 --> 03:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
staff and time to to do to do that
 
03:31:40.189 --> 03:31:40.199 align:start position:0%
licensing program and oversight uh but
 
03:31:43.349 --> 03:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
we do our best uh we work with equines
 
03:31:46.830 --> 03:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
uh we try to oversee um
 
03:31:48.990 --> 03:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh poultry operations because right
 
03:31:51.630 --> 03:31:51.640 align:start position:0%
now Aven influenza is flying through uh
 
03:31:54.030 --> 03:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
the state and the nation um our main
 
03:31:56.510 --> 03:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
challenges are resources uh increase in
 
03:31:58.990 --> 03:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
the number of small backyard Farms
 
03:32:00.670 --> 03:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
compared to larger Farms there's a
 
03:32:02.670 --> 03:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
consolidation of farms going west and we
 
03:32:04.229 --> 03:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
have a lot of small backyard Farms which
 
03:32:05.710 --> 03:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
are wonderful but they're harder to
 
03:32:07.510 --> 03:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
manage harder to communicate with
 
03:32:10.189 --> 03:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes and sometimes harder to find
 
03:32:12.790 --> 03:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
um and then uh a lot of unmet needs
 
03:32:15.110 --> 03:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
which we can talk about another time
 
03:32:17.710 --> 03:32:17.720 align:start position:0%
aquaculture surds uh the garbage
 
03:32:19.950 --> 03:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
Management program I mentioned uh small
 
03:32:21.550 --> 03:32:21.560 align:start position:0%
backyard flocks would love a lot more
 
03:32:23.150 --> 03:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
help from us and we would love to get
 
03:32:26.950 --> 03:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
give them that we give them some um U
 
03:32:28.630 --> 03:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
multiple opportunities for us to grow
 
03:32:31.349 --> 03:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
and do agriculture related things um
 
03:32:32.990 --> 03:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
instead of where sometimes our time ends
 
03:32:35.110 --> 03:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
up being spent and the last page last
 
03:32:37.349 --> 03:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
slide uh you're all very aware I'm sure
 
03:32:39.710 --> 03:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
of the hpai highly pathogenic Avan
 
03:32:41.389 --> 03:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
influenza outbreak that's happening for
 
03:32:42.990 --> 03:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
the last 3 years across the poultry
 
03:32:46.150 --> 03:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
industry 130 million Birds lost and the
 
03:32:48.950 --> 03:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
industry is really struggling staggering
 
03:32:51.550 --> 03:32:51.560 align:start position:0%
it has now jumped as of uh March of last
 
03:32:53.550 --> 03:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
year into the dairy industry and is
 
03:32:56.429 --> 03:32:56.439 align:start position:0%
affecting uh cows and high levels of
 
03:32:58.150 --> 03:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
virus are being found in the milk the
 
03:33:00.990 --> 03:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
milk is safe to drink it's pasteurized
 
03:33:04.469 --> 03:33:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh raw milk is in question and um it has
 
03:33:06.630 --> 03:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
now spread to 17 different states and
 
03:33:08.110 --> 03:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
over a thousand dairy farms in the
 
03:33:10.070 --> 03:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
United States so we spend for the last
 
03:33:12.189 --> 03:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
three years a huge amount of our time
 
03:33:14.670 --> 03:33:14.680 align:start position:0%
monitoring just this one virus and we
 
03:33:16.309 --> 03:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
are very concerned about it
 
03:33:18.510 --> 03:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
uh so it's not a small it's not a small
 
03:33:19.830 --> 03:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
thing and there's a lot of potential for
 
03:33:21.590 --> 03:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
it to get worse so we're starting our
 
03:33:24.710 --> 03:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
own State milk um monitoring program
 
03:33:26.389 --> 03:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
that Dr Crawford has launched and so
 
03:33:27.349 --> 03:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
that we're going to start looking at
 
03:33:29.389 --> 03:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
bulk tank and Silo milk and start just
 
03:33:31.389 --> 03:33:31.399 align:start position:0%
making sure that uh the milk isn't in
 
03:33:34.309 --> 03:33:34.319 align:start position:0%
our state uh that the no infected virus
 
03:33:36.870 --> 03:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
or cattle are in our state uh so thank
 
03:33:38.510 --> 03:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
you very much sorry for the going over
 
03:33:40.510 --> 03:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
represent H Haskins had a question yes
 
03:33:42.030 --> 03:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you Dr
 
03:33:43.790 --> 03:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
Harvey could you share your contact
 
03:33:46.189 --> 03:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
information with us yep absolutely Ely
 
03:33:48.389 --> 03:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
um Dr Crawford's information is on the
 
03:33:50.750 --> 03:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
front page here name and number and uh I
 
03:33:52.870 --> 03:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
can certainly give you all my my card
 
03:33:55.150 --> 03:33:55.160 align:start position:0%
and my my contact info our email is the
 
03:33:56.389 --> 03:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
same it's always first name middle
 
03:33:58.870 --> 03:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
initial and last we can send all of that
 
03:34:00.790 --> 03:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
when we send the um presentation in to
 
03:34:05.229 --> 03:34:05.239 align:start position:0%
Jamie too thank you uh represent
 
03:34:08.750 --> 03:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
sakas hi um I appreciate very much what
 
03:34:11.990 --> 03:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
you said about the transfer of dogs and
 
03:34:14.790 --> 03:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
cats um I think that a lot of people
 
03:34:16.469 --> 03:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
03:34:20.550 --> 03:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
and they just pass pets around wherever
 
03:34:23.670 --> 03:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
but the thing I was just curious about
 
03:34:25.349 --> 03:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
are the
 
03:34:29.590 --> 03:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
the import of animals from kill shelters
 
03:34:33.389 --> 03:34:33.399 align:start position:0%
in the South because they come up like
 
03:34:37.990 --> 03:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
on 93 or 95 and they um drop these
 
03:34:42.429 --> 03:34:42.439 align:start position:0%
animals off at rest stops and um it just
 
03:34:46.510 --> 03:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
seems like this huge black hole
 
03:34:49.870 --> 03:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
amen thank you for saying that and there
 
03:34:51.990 --> 03:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
is a massive massive pet trafficking
 
03:34:54.189 --> 03:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
industry and I I that's my own word that
 
03:34:55.950 --> 03:34:55.960 align:start position:0%
is Dr Nate Harvey's word that's not the
 
03:34:58.030 --> 03:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
division's word but there is a massive
 
03:34:59.550 --> 03:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
massive flow of pets going from the
 
03:35:02.189 --> 03:35:02.199 align:start position:0%
south to the north we have a as far as
 
03:35:03.950 --> 03:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
States go with their programs to monitor
 
03:35:05.830 --> 03:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
intake paperwork and monitor paperwork
 
03:35:07.710 --> 03:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
within the state we are pretty darn good
 
03:35:09.790 --> 03:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
compared to some of the other states uh
 
03:35:11.389 --> 03:35:11.399 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately that helps us to
 
03:35:13.269 --> 03:35:13.279 align:start position:0%
reveal and see how many animals there
 
03:35:15.389 --> 03:35:15.399 align:start position:0%
are I'm not saying that's wrong people
 
03:35:17.030 --> 03:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
are trying to do the right thing and
 
03:35:18.790 --> 03:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
help animals but a lot of them do not
 
03:35:20.229 --> 03:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
want to be regulated they don't want to
 
03:35:21.750 --> 03:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
be known about and they definitely don't
 
03:35:23.550 --> 03:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
want to have to submit paperwork and ra
 
03:35:25.590 --> 03:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
proof of rabies vaccinations and all the
 
03:35:27.510 --> 03:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
things that protect public health so we
 
03:35:29.269 --> 03:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
found it to be a difficult uh population
 
03:35:31.710 --> 03:35:31.720 align:start position:0%
of people to work with sometimes but uh
 
03:35:33.349 --> 03:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
we I think we're making good progress
 
03:35:34.830 --> 03:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
but thank you for saying that that's
 
03:35:37.790 --> 03:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
very uh Miner and then
 
03:35:40.429 --> 03:35:40.439 align:start position:0%
Bixby thank you madam chairman doct uh
 
03:35:42.349 --> 03:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
what what types of plans are in place to
 
03:35:44.070 --> 03:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh mitigate
 
03:35:46.710 --> 03:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
h5n1 um that is something we can we can
 
03:35:48.349 --> 03:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
send you a whole email with some of the
 
03:35:50.030 --> 03:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
things we've done within the state of
 
03:35:52.110 --> 03:35:52.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we're monitoring milk
 
03:35:53.910 --> 03:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
we're communicating with dairy farms I
 
03:35:56.950 --> 03:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
assume you mean h5n1 and dairy farms um
 
03:35:58.550 --> 03:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
we've done extensive amount of work with
 
03:36:00.229 --> 03:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
poultry and all the other states have
 
03:36:02.309 --> 03:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
done extensive amount of work with ptry
 
03:36:04.309 --> 03:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
but when it uh changed in April and
 
03:36:06.790 --> 03:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
started infecting dairy cattle it became
 
03:36:08.189 --> 03:36:08.199 align:start position:0%
something we've never seen before we've
 
03:36:10.150 --> 03:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
never seen a virus with this level of
 
03:36:11.990 --> 03:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
virus in the milk dairy count milk is
 
03:36:13.910 --> 03:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
usually not a site for virus uh to
 
03:36:15.309 --> 03:36:15.319 align:start position:0%
concentrate in so that's become a
 
03:36:15.319 --> 03:36:16.309 align:start position:0%
concentrate in so that's become a
problem

03:36:16.309 --> 03:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:36:18.469 --> 03:36:18.479 align:start position:0%
and so we're doing milk sampling we're
 
03:36:20.269 --> 03:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
just starting it now in fact not only
 
03:36:21.630 --> 03:36:21.640 align:start position:0%
are our milk inspectors in the
 
03:36:23.229 --> 03:36:23.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Human Health and Human
 
03:36:25.389 --> 03:36:25.399 align:start position:0%
Services trained to collect milk samples
 
03:36:27.349 --> 03:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
and submit them for testing we just
 
03:36:29.469 --> 03:36:29.479 align:start position:0%
jumped on board this past week and our
 
03:36:31.070 --> 03:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
animal health technicians just got
 
03:36:33.670 --> 03:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
trained and certified as milk inspectors
 
03:36:35.670 --> 03:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
in case we end up with an emergency in
 
03:36:37.670 --> 03:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
our state or anywhere in New England
 
03:36:39.309 --> 03:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
where this shows up in even a single cow
 
03:36:41.070 --> 03:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
in New England uh we're going to start
 
03:36:44.309 --> 03:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
ramping up and potentially even uh test
 
03:36:45.950 --> 03:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
down to the farm level or to the bulk
 
03:36:47.870 --> 03:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
tank level right now we're doing over
 
03:36:49.990 --> 03:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
large samples of silos that cover big
 
03:36:51.750 --> 03:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
areas just to make sure we don't have it
 
03:36:53.790 --> 03:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
at all in the state thank you
 
03:36:56.830 --> 03:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah so did I
 
03:36:59.150 --> 03:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly that the the um
 
03:37:01.910 --> 03:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
animal transfer database which is sort
 
03:37:05.870 --> 03:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
of completely online like now uh has
 
03:37:07.389 --> 03:37:07.399 align:start position:0%
really has helped
 
03:37:10.910 --> 03:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
identify uh the the number of transfers
 
03:37:12.790 --> 03:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
that we're failing to
 
03:37:17.150 --> 03:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
track well no because because that it
 
03:37:19.110 --> 03:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
has helped us to identify the number of
 
03:37:20.750 --> 03:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
transfers of people that get the
 
03:37:23.429 --> 03:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
appropriate paperwork which is
 
03:37:25.550 --> 03:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
already exponentially more than we
 
03:37:26.950 --> 03:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
thought because before we had paper
 
03:37:29.229 --> 03:37:29.239 align:start position:0%
records that we couldn't even store
 
03:37:31.150 --> 03:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
there was so such a volume now that it's
 
03:37:32.950 --> 03:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
electronic and I can hit search how many
 
03:37:34.950 --> 03:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
certificates we had we've already had
 
03:37:38.870 --> 03:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
5,000 just about 4,840 certificates uh
 
03:37:40.309 --> 03:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
just over the last few months in our
 
03:37:41.910 --> 03:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
pilot program of this and some of our
 
03:37:43.389 --> 03:37:43.399 align:start position:0%
veterinarians have not even signed on to
 
03:37:47.590 --> 03:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
use it yet uh so um the the people who
 
03:37:49.429 --> 03:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
are moving animals which is a vast
 
03:37:51.070 --> 03:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
majority of people don't know that if
 
03:37:52.389 --> 03:37:52.399 align:start position:0%
you're going to change the ownership of
 
03:37:54.469 --> 03:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
your pet whether it means Give It Away
 
03:37:57.189 --> 03:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
sell it Rescue It adopt it out by law in
 
03:37:58.910 --> 03:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you're supposed to provide
 
03:38:00.710 --> 03:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
official health certificate or official
 
03:38:02.870 --> 03:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
certificate of transfer for that animal
 
03:38:04.429 --> 03:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
most people aren't doing that most
 
03:38:06.309 --> 03:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
people think you can just sell a dog or
 
03:38:07.630 --> 03:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
your give it to your
 
03:38:10.550 --> 03:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
cousin I'm I don't even know how much it
 
03:38:12.790 --> 03:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
will be if we don't uh follow the the
 
03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
paperwork that's a great question
 
03:38:15.990 --> 03:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bigby
 
03:38:18.070 --> 03:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative Scully and then sopis we
 
03:38:20.630 --> 03:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
have to kind of Move Along because uh
 
03:38:22.750 --> 03:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
time is running through thank you
 
03:38:24.070 --> 03:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative Scully well thank you
 
03:38:26.550 --> 03:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you doctor for being
 
03:38:29.790 --> 03:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
here how is are these outbreaks actually
 
03:38:32.150 --> 03:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
occurring is it animal trade between
 
03:38:33.750 --> 03:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
states and when they say it BR it's in
 
03:38:36.429 --> 03:38:36.439 align:start position:0%
17 States you know how does how does it
 
03:38:38.590 --> 03:38:38.600 align:start position:0%
get that The quick summary is to look at
 
03:38:40.269 --> 03:38:40.279 align:start position:0%
the two great question the two
 
03:38:42.750 --> 03:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
differences between the two h5n1 viruses
 
03:38:44.790 --> 03:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
we're dealing right now in the birds
 
03:38:46.790 --> 03:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's in the Wildlife population and it
 
03:38:49.189 --> 03:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
is in every most every many of the ducks
 
03:38:51.030 --> 03:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
and birds and geese flying over our
 
03:38:52.710 --> 03:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
farms and it's being showered across the
 
03:38:55.349 --> 03:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
United States which is how 130 million
 
03:38:57.590 --> 03:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
birds have been affected by this in the
 
03:38:59.510 --> 03:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
dairy industry it was a mutation that
 
03:39:01.910 --> 03:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
caused it to infect a cow and that
 
03:39:05.750 --> 03:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
individual first index cow in Texas then
 
03:39:07.830 --> 03:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
infected another cow and another cow and
 
03:39:10.030 --> 03:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
some calves and the movement of cows
 
03:39:12.550 --> 03:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
across the states is how that has spread
 
03:39:14.229 --> 03:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
so it depends on the animal and the
 
03:39:16.429 --> 03:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
virus you're talking about the milk one
 
03:39:18.389 --> 03:39:18.399 align:start position:0%
is movement of cattle there's no
 
03:39:20.870 --> 03:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
Wildlife Reservoir spreading this at all
 
03:39:22.950 --> 03:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
this is strictly milk moving it direct
 
03:39:24.830 --> 03:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
contact so it's an excellent question
 
03:39:27.670 --> 03:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
because that matters our response yeah
 
03:39:29.309 --> 03:39:29.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:39:34.030 --> 03:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
sopus um one more question is um and I
 
03:39:36.870 --> 03:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
might have old information but was that
 
03:39:39.950 --> 03:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
virus then from the cow transmitted to a
 
03:39:42.950 --> 03:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
human or was it from the birds to the
 
03:39:46.550 --> 03:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
human the the the the new new uh stories
 
03:39:48.110 --> 03:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
you're hearing this year of people being
 
03:39:50.630 --> 03:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
infected with h5n1 virus those are
 
03:39:52.830 --> 03:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
people being coming sick predominantly
 
03:39:55.590 --> 03:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
from milk from cows from milking cows
 
03:39:57.429 --> 03:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
and having raw milk splattered on a
 
03:39:58.870 --> 03:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
small level in your eyes or in your
 
03:40:02.110 --> 03:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
mouth or um there were a couple of very
 
03:40:03.790 --> 03:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
very rare instances of it being
 
03:40:06.150 --> 03:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
transmitted by birds to people but the
 
03:40:08.030 --> 03:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the people you've heard
 
03:40:09.590 --> 03:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
getting sick including the very sick
 
03:40:11.429 --> 03:40:11.439 align:start position:0%
people that all came from milk from this
 
03:40:12.870 --> 03:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
new outbreak in cattle that we're
 
03:40:16.910 --> 03:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:18.790 --> 03:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate all the
 
03:40:28.630 --> 03:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:32.030 --> 03:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
provided good afternoon um for the
 
03:40:33.750 --> 03:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
record my name is Josh Marshall and I'm
 
03:40:35.030 --> 03:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
the assistant commissioner for the
 
03:40:36.630 --> 03:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture markets and
 
03:40:38.830 --> 03:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
food but to continue the chair's
 
03:40:40.870 --> 03:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
metaphor I am pinch hitting for uh
 
03:40:42.790 --> 03:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
Cheryl A our director of weights and
 
03:40:44.870 --> 03:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
measures today who's at a National
 
03:40:44.880 --> 03:40:45.870 align:start position:0%
measures today who's at a National
Conference

03:40:45.870 --> 03:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
Conference
 
03:40:49.189 --> 03:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
um in uh South Carolina I believe I'm
 
03:40:51.670 --> 03:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
going to be very brief because I'm not
 
03:40:53.830 --> 03:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
the subject matter expert on here and we
 
03:40:55.870 --> 03:40:55.880 align:start position:0%
have a really good distillation of the
 
03:40:58.870 --> 03:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
overview of the division in the slides
 
03:41:01.269 --> 03:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
but I did want to mention a couple of
 
03:41:04.910 --> 03:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
things to sort of set the stage um you
 
03:41:05.950 --> 03:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
know the Division of Weights and
 
03:41:07.950 --> 03:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
measures serves the public to ensure
 
03:41:10.510 --> 03:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
Equity prevails in the marketplace for
 
03:41:12.870 --> 03:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
both consumers and businesses by
 
03:41:14.710 --> 03:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
supporting and regulating Commerce that
 
03:41:16.550 --> 03:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
is sold by a weight or a measure a
 
03:41:18.710 --> 03:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
couple of examples of that would be the
 
03:41:21.070 --> 03:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
deli scale at the supermarket which is
 
03:41:22.469 --> 03:41:22.479 align:start position:0%
charging you a certain amount of money
 
03:41:24.790 --> 03:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
for a certain weight of meat or the fuel
 
03:41:26.389 --> 03:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
pump at the gas station which is
 
03:41:28.389 --> 03:41:28.399 align:start position:0%
charging you for a certain amount of
 
03:41:31.309 --> 03:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
liquid by volume and so we have a number
 
03:41:34.670 --> 03:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
of inspectors that we send out to make
 
03:41:37.229 --> 03:41:37.239 align:start position:0%
sure that uh all of those um are
 
03:41:40.790 --> 03:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
licensed and certified and um just some
 
03:41:43.510 --> 03:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
of the high level numbers the division
 
03:41:45.630 --> 03:41:45.640 align:start position:0%
currently licenses 20,00 th000
 
03:41:48.110 --> 03:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
commercial devices owned by more than
 
03:41:48.120 --> 03:41:49.590 align:start position:0%
commercial devices owned by more than
2,800

03:41:49.590 --> 03:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
2,800
 
03:41:51.630 --> 03:41:51.640 align:start position:0%
businesses now that doesn't mean that
 
03:41:53.710 --> 03:41:53.720 align:start position:0%
we're our inspectors we have three
 
03:41:55.670 --> 03:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
inspectors uh on staff it doesn't mean
 
03:41:57.950 --> 03:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
that they're going out and touching each
 
03:42:00.830 --> 03:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
of those devices each year because we
 
03:42:05.590 --> 03:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
also um license 2117 service technicians
 
03:42:08.349 --> 03:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
from private business who can also
 
03:42:11.910 --> 03:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
inspect tests and certify those devices
 
03:42:14.110 --> 03:42:14.120 align:start position:0%
uh we have sort of an audit program
 
03:42:16.550 --> 03:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
Where It's Our intention to have
 
03:42:18.830 --> 03:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
Department staff touch each device
 
03:42:21.030 --> 03:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
within every five years so that we're
 
03:42:23.349 --> 03:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
getting around to make sure that our
 
03:42:26.030 --> 03:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
staff see and certify each device but
 
03:42:28.510 --> 03:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
that's a the volume of devices is too
 
03:42:31.309 --> 03:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
much for us to do each year there's over
 
03:42:33.750 --> 03:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
a thousand way Masters who operate
 
03:42:35.870 --> 03:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle scales that are used
 
03:42:38.670 --> 03:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
commercially and uh the division itself
 
03:42:41.189 --> 03:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
has eight full-time equivalents
 
03:42:43.510 --> 03:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
including the director uh a program
 
03:42:45.790 --> 03:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
specialist and program assistant who
 
03:42:47.389 --> 03:42:47.399 align:start position:0%
support the administrative needs of the
 
03:42:49.750 --> 03:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
licensing and certification programs and
 
03:42:52.030 --> 03:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
Three Investigators uh along with the
 
03:42:54.830 --> 03:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
state metrologist and a part-time State
 
03:42:57.590 --> 03:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
met meterologist um I just also want to
 
03:42:59.910 --> 03:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
point out that the inspectors and the
 
03:43:02.990 --> 03:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
director are also uh certified through
 
03:43:04.670 --> 03:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Police Academy as
 
03:43:06.830 --> 03:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
part-time police officers which helps
 
03:43:10.149 --> 03:43:10.159 align:start position:0%
with their ability to enforce um some of
 
03:43:11.990 --> 03:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
these uh issues that might come up I'll
 
03:43:13.910 --> 03:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
give you a quick example if you see the
 
03:43:17.070 --> 03:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
big roadside sign at the uh gas station
 
03:43:19.750 --> 03:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
says 299 a gallon you get to the pump
 
03:43:22.229 --> 03:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
and as you're pumping the computer reads
 
03:43:24.750 --> 03:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
329 that's uh out of compliance you
 
03:43:26.990 --> 03:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
would report that to the division who
 
03:43:28.630 --> 03:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
would send an inspector out there to see
 
03:43:30.229 --> 03:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
what type of enforcement action should
 
03:43:33.269 --> 03:43:33.279 align:start position:0%
be taken
 
03:43:35.510 --> 03:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot more detail but I want
 
03:43:37.630 --> 03:43:37.640 align:start position:0%
to get to the folks who um are subject
 
03:43:39.349 --> 03:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
matter experts but I'm happy to try to
 
03:43:47.149 --> 03:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:51.429 --> 03:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
yeah so um in terms of uh what might be
 
03:43:54.309 --> 03:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
um tested under scales would you uh
 
03:43:57.269 --> 03:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
would your division uh test the scales
 
03:43:59.670 --> 03:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
that are used by by farmers who are
 
03:44:01.469 --> 03:44:01.479 align:start position:0%
selling at the farmers market or through
 
03:44:05.070 --> 03:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
csas Etc absolutely and one of the um
 
03:44:07.070 --> 03:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
one of the services sort of the Outreach
 
03:44:09.269 --> 03:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
that's within some of the details of
 
03:44:11.550 --> 03:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
these slides is we offer scale clinics
 
03:44:13.309 --> 03:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
across the state I believe there's 10 of
 
03:44:15.269 --> 03:44:15.279 align:start position:0%
them across the state usually in
 
03:44:16.790 --> 03:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
coordination with a Cooperative
 
03:44:19.429 --> 03:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
Extension field office and farmers can
 
03:44:22.750 --> 03:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
bring up to three scales that are 30 PBS
 
03:44:25.269 --> 03:44:25.279 align:start position:0%
or less and have those scales certified
 
03:44:27.750 --> 03:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
for free so there's no charge they still
 
03:44:30.550 --> 03:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
have to apply for the license which is
 
03:44:33.469 --> 03:44:33.479 align:start position:0%
$18 if I recall uh after the last check
 
03:44:36.790 --> 03:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
I paid um for my scales and um then they
 
03:44:39.710 --> 03:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
can get the the certification done for
 
03:44:42.910 --> 03:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
free any other questions thank you so
 
03:44:42.920 --> 03:44:55.070 align:start position:0%
free any other questions thank you so
much

03:44:55.070 --> 03:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:58.870 --> 03:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
hello hello thank
 
03:45:02.469 --> 03:45:02.479 align:start position:0%
you I AMG duie and I will sit and use
 
03:45:04.990 --> 03:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
the microphone in just a moment I don't
 
03:45:07.349 --> 03:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
want to overburden you with items but we
 
03:45:09.349 --> 03:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
do a lot of Outreach and so in these
 
03:45:11.070 --> 03:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
folders is a copy of what I'm going to
 
03:45:13.790 --> 03:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
talk about today as well as some of the
 
03:45:15.670 --> 03:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
Outreach material that put together
 
03:45:19.070 --> 03:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:19.080 --> 03:45:20.710 align:start position:0%
 
again

03:45:20.710 --> 03:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:45:25.070 --> 03:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
amling my director today here at Seager
 
03:45:27.550 --> 03:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
her contact information is in that
 
03:45:30.389 --> 03:45:30.399 align:start position:0%
folder um as well as on the copy that
 
03:45:30.399 --> 03:45:31.790 align:start position:0%
folder um as well as on the copy that
you

03:45:31.790 --> 03:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:45:35.189 --> 03:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
received and I will begin with our
 
03:45:37.590 --> 03:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
mission um so I'm an entomologist with
 
03:45:40.670 --> 03:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
the Department our mission is to curtail
 
03:45:43.429 --> 03:45:43.439 align:start position:0%
the spread of invasive insects plants
 
03:45:45.429 --> 03:45:45.439 align:start position:0%
and pathogens that may neg atively
 
03:45:48.229 --> 03:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
impact agriculture natural and human
 
03:45:50.229 --> 03:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
ecosystems within the state of New
 
03:45:53.590 --> 03:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we focus this on pests moved
 
03:45:54.950 --> 03:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
by human
 
03:45:57.670 --> 03:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
activities the core functions of our
 
03:45:59.750 --> 03:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
division is to accomplish our mission
 
03:46:03.269 --> 03:46:03.279 align:start position:0%
through lure inspection survey
 
03:46:05.950 --> 03:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
certification quarantine and Outreach
 
03:46:08.790 --> 03:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
activities for example the coasters that
 
03:46:11.229 --> 03:46:11.239 align:start position:0%
you have in your folders have spotted
 
03:46:13.630 --> 03:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
Lantern fly on them which is a pest we
 
03:46:16.550 --> 03:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
are very concerned about it is close in
 
03:46:18.189 --> 03:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts as close as North
 
03:46:20.229 --> 03:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
chelsford and Fitchburg but we don't
 
03:46:22.269 --> 03:46:22.279 align:start position:0%
know of any established populations in
 
03:46:22.279 --> 03:46:23.189 align:start position:0%
know of any established populations in
New

03:46:23.189 --> 03:46:23.199 align:start position:0%
New
 
03:46:25.630 --> 03:46:25.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have the Upland invasive
 
03:46:28.229 --> 03:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
species coordinator who works with
 
03:46:30.309 --> 03:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
invasive plant management throughout New
 
03:46:32.790 --> 03:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the division takes the lead on
 
03:46:35.870 --> 03:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
eradication of regulated pests when it's
 
03:46:38.229 --> 03:46:38.239 align:start position:0%
warranted and then we're responsible for
 
03:46:41.670 --> 03:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
honeybee Health we have fulltime five
 
03:46:44.149 --> 03:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
full-time employees four of those are
 
03:46:46.510 --> 03:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
entomologist IST s and one of them is an
 
03:46:49.349 --> 03:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
is a botanist it's uh pretty nerdy over
 
03:46:52.630 --> 03:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
in our office we have one part-time
 
03:46:55.429 --> 03:46:55.439 align:start position:0%
employee and he is our apiary
 
03:46:58.389 --> 03:46:58.399 align:start position:0%
inspector some of the activities that we
 
03:47:00.870 --> 03:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
conduct are nursery and plant dealer
 
03:47:03.950 --> 03:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
licensing we do a uh an inspection
 
03:47:06.030 --> 03:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
program within the people that hold
 
03:47:09.309 --> 03:47:09.319 align:start position:0%
those licenses we certify Nursery stock
 
03:47:11.630 --> 03:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
and other plant products such as
 
03:47:14.429 --> 03:47:14.439 align:start position:0%
firewood we issue compliance agreements
 
03:47:16.590 --> 03:47:16.600 align:start position:0%
and permits for the movement of this
 
03:47:20.189 --> 03:47:20.199 align:start position:0%
material we conduct exotic pest surveys
 
03:47:22.030 --> 03:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
for federal that these are federally
 
03:47:24.469 --> 03:47:24.479 align:start position:0%
funded um and they are for pests of
 
03:47:27.870 --> 03:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
state and National concern we partner
 
03:47:30.349 --> 03:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
with the USDA on permitting for
 
03:47:33.110 --> 03:47:33.120 align:start position:0%

invasive species program and Remediation
 
03:47:50.429 --> 03:47:50.439 align:start position:0%
fund we survey map um and conduct
 
03:47:53.630 --> 03:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
invasive plant control and Outreach the
 
03:47:56.389 --> 03:47:56.399 align:start position:0%
apiary restriction sorry the apiary
 
03:47:58.590 --> 03:47:58.600 align:start position:0%
registration program we have is
 
03:48:00.910 --> 03:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
voluntary and we have an apiary
 
03:48:02.750 --> 03:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
inspection program and those inspections
 
03:48:05.670 --> 03:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
are conducted by the part-time employee
 
03:48:08.389 --> 03:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
and then we identify insects of Public
 
03:48:11.550 --> 03:48:11.560 align:start position:0%
public concern um arrod identification
 
03:48:14.309 --> 03:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
usually consists of spiders or ticks
 
03:48:16.110 --> 03:48:16.120 align:start position:0%
things people are concerned about around
 
03:48:19.670 --> 03:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
their house and things like that the
 
03:48:22.070 --> 03:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
next slide are our primary laws and
 
03:48:24.189 --> 03:48:24.199 align:start position:0%
rules I won't spend too much time here
 
03:48:25.870 --> 03:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
but I would just want to point out that
 
03:48:28.670 --> 03:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
we just recently reviewed and revamped
 
03:48:31.429 --> 03:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
our beekeeping And Hive products rules
 
03:48:34.389 --> 03:48:34.399 align:start position:0%
and two of our major rules are up for um
 
03:48:36.590 --> 03:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
they expire in 2027 and that's the
 
03:48:38.750 --> 03:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
nursery plant dealers and Nursery stock
 
03:48:41.830 --> 03:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
rules as well of as our invasives um and
 
03:48:43.910 --> 03:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
so we're going to be looking a lot
 
03:48:46.710 --> 03:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
closer at them in the next pium I wanted
 
03:48:50.950 --> 03:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
to note that we as of 2024 we had 990
 
03:48:53.750 --> 03:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
licensed plant dealers in New Hampshire
 
03:48:56.710 --> 03:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
and then we are up to 701 registered
 
03:49:00.790 --> 03:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
Apiaries wow wow some notable
 
03:49:02.750 --> 03:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
quarantines that I wanted to mention are
 
03:49:05.389 --> 03:49:05.399 align:start position:0%
the firewood quarantine this is New
 
03:49:07.830 --> 03:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specific and protects New
 
03:49:10.429 --> 03:49:10.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by prohibiting the importation
 
03:49:12.790 --> 03:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
of untreated firewood there are
 
03:49:14.950 --> 03:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
exceptions to this as allowed by
 
03:49:16.469 --> 03:49:16.479 align:start position:0%
compliance agreements which our
 
03:49:20.229 --> 03:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
inspectors um take care of spongy moth
 
03:49:22.229 --> 03:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
formerly known as gypsy moth is a
 
03:49:24.830 --> 03:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
federally regulated uh sorry it's a
 
03:49:27.030 --> 03:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
federally regulated Pest and New
 
03:49:28.790 --> 03:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is within this federally
 
03:49:31.990 --> 03:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
regulated area shippers or producers
 
03:49:33.950 --> 03:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire that are sending
 
03:49:36.349 --> 03:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
regulated articles outside of this
 
03:49:38.469 --> 03:49:38.479 align:start position:0%
quarantine area must be under a
 
03:49:41.510 --> 03:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
compliance agreement um or have an
 
03:49:44.750 --> 03:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
inspection Japanese beetle European corn
 
03:49:47.990 --> 03:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
or onion white rot and a few others are
 
03:49:49.750 --> 03:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
pests that we've dealt with here in New
 
03:49:51.870 --> 03:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for maybe decades but not
 
03:49:54.189 --> 03:49:54.199 align:start position:0%
every state in the nation has them there
 
03:49:56.149 --> 03:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
are particular states that have
 
03:49:59.030 --> 03:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
regulations specific to those pests and
 
03:50:01.750 --> 03:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
we assist New Hampshire producers to
 
03:50:03.269 --> 03:50:03.279 align:start position:0%
meeting those plant protection
 
03:50:05.750 --> 03:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
requirements of the receiving States
 
03:50:08.189 --> 03:50:08.199 align:start position:0%
most of the time um that does vary by
 
03:50:10.670 --> 03:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
state by the good or the plant product
 
03:50:12.710 --> 03:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
that they want to ship the production
 
03:50:14.349 --> 03:50:14.359 align:start position:0%
and storage conditions as well as
 
03:50:15.870 --> 03:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes the point of origin of the
 
03:50:18.269 --> 03:50:18.279 align:start position:0%
plant material this usually requires
 
03:50:20.830 --> 03:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
certification and
 
03:50:23.510 --> 03:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
inspection um I want to point out that
 
03:50:26.469 --> 03:50:26.479 align:start position:0%
in 2024 we conducted pest detection
 
03:50:29.389 --> 03:50:29.399 align:start position:0%
surveys for 33 pest threats to New
 
03:50:31.950 --> 03:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the nation these surveys
 
03:50:34.189 --> 03:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
were conducted at nurseries Vegetable
 
03:50:37.590 --> 03:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
Farms roadside locations forested areas
 
03:50:41.870 --> 03:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
that are identified as high risk in 2025
 
03:50:45.189 --> 03:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
we have 35 pests on the list that we are
 
03:50:47.830 --> 03:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
going to be surveying for at similar
 
03:50:50.389 --> 03:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
locations a couple of the challenges I
 
03:50:52.030 --> 03:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
can point out real quick are that the
 
03:50:53.670 --> 03:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
distribution cost of one of our
 
03:50:56.349 --> 03:50:56.359 align:start position:0%
full-time employees is across multiple
 
03:50:59.070 --> 03:50:59.080 align:start position:0%
accounting units um and multiple federal
 
03:51:01.349 --> 03:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
grants this state system that we
 
03:51:03.990 --> 03:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
currently use does not accommodate this
 
03:51:05.630 --> 03:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
and it does require a number of
 
03:51:08.149 --> 03:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
additional man hours to ensure correct
 
03:51:10.550 --> 03:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
budgeting the second is supporting
 
03:51:12.790 --> 03:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
online vendors shipping plants out of
 
03:51:16.149 --> 03:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
state e-commerce is is a concern
 
03:51:18.630 --> 03:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
Nationwide and my boss is probably
 
03:51:19.950 --> 03:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
talking about it right now at the
 
03:51:22.790 --> 03:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
meeting she is at um this is a
 
03:51:25.830 --> 03:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
non-traditional type of clientele that
 
03:51:28.110 --> 03:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
may have needs such as those regulatory
 
03:51:29.790 --> 03:51:29.800 align:start position:0%
requirements that are not being met by
 
03:51:30.910 --> 03:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
our current
 
03:51:33.309 --> 03:51:33.319 align:start position:0%
system and the third challenge I'd like
 
03:51:34.910 --> 03:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
to talk about is the information
 
03:51:37.070 --> 03:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
management and accessibility across of
 
03:51:39.910 --> 03:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
our across all of our programs licenses
 
03:51:42.389 --> 03:51:42.399 align:start position:0%
inspection and survey and we can end
 
03:51:44.670 --> 03:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
with this one because it's ending on a
 
03:51:46.990 --> 03:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
positive note we have just uh
 
03:51:48.950 --> 03:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
implemented or are starting to implement
 
03:51:51.269 --> 03:51:51.279 align:start position:0%
the LCP system with Trace first
 
03:51:53.149 --> 03:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
University and this is hopefully going
 
03:51:55.309 --> 03:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
to allow us to do everything online
 
03:51:56.950 --> 03:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
manage things a little bit better and
 
03:51:59.149 --> 03:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
it's very exciting for our staff to be
 
03:52:02.910 --> 03:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
able to like actually join the 21st
 
03:52:05.469 --> 03:52:05.479 align:start position:0%
century and lastly I wanted to talk
 
03:52:06.910 --> 03:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
about a couple of the Innovative
 
03:52:09.630 --> 03:52:09.640 align:start position:0%
programs that our division partakes in
 
03:52:12.670 --> 03:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
NH bugs. org is an excellent online
 
03:52:14.510 --> 03:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
resource for New Hampshire residents
 
03:52:16.910 --> 03:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
resents as well as visitors to the state
 
03:52:18.670 --> 03:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
it's a collaboration between the
 
03:52:21.030 --> 03:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
division of plant industry the division
 
03:52:22.990 --> 03:52:23.000 align:start position:0%

03:52:33.630 --> 03:52:33.640 align:start position:0%
as the USDA Forest Service this is a
 
03:52:36.269 --> 03:52:36.279 align:start position:0%
streamline this program or the website
 
03:52:39.269 --> 03:52:39.279 align:start position:0%
allows for a streamline response for
 
03:52:42.070 --> 03:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
Pest detections and public reports we
 
03:52:44.070 --> 03:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
rely heavily on the public to report
 
03:52:46.229 --> 03:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
things such as spotted Lantern fly which
 
03:52:48.710 --> 03:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
is why we've developed coasters so that
 
03:52:51.110 --> 03:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
people now know just another way for us
 
03:52:54.229 --> 03:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
to reach people um and this NH bugs. org
 
03:52:56.630 --> 03:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
has a strong collaborative effort it's
 
03:52:58.550 --> 03:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
um we kind of like to view it as a
 
03:52:59.990 --> 03:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
clearing house where all those
 
03:53:02.110 --> 03:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
departments that are working can put the
 
03:53:04.590 --> 03:53:04.600 align:start position:0%
information in one stop in one place for
 
03:53:07.229 --> 03:53:07.239 align:start position:0%
One-Stop shopping for the residents
 
03:53:10.790 --> 03:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
firewood scout.org is about recreational
 
03:53:13.910 --> 03:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
transportation of firewood risks um
 
03:53:15.990 --> 03:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
firewood is the number one pathway for
 
03:53:18.110 --> 03:53:18.120 align:start position:0%

03:53:21.030 --> 03:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
firewood Scout a few years ago this is
 
03:53:24.429 --> 03:53:24.439 align:start position:0%
uh provides Outreach for proactive steps

03:53:29.950 --> 03:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire forests it's an online mapping
 
03:53:33.349 --> 03:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
platform that allows visitors to look up
 
03:53:35.670 --> 03:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
where firewood is going to be for sale
 
03:53:37.630 --> 03:53:37.640 align:start position:0%
near the location that they're camping
 
03:53:39.550 --> 03:53:39.560 align:start position:0%
all they have to do is type in the the
 
03:53:41.149 --> 03:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
zip code of where they're going to be
 
03:53:43.030 --> 03:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
staying and it pops up a list of the
 
03:53:44.670 --> 03:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
vendors in New Hampshire in that that
 
03:53:47.030 --> 03:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
area within a certain radius New
 
03:53:49.870 --> 03:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is one of 13 states taking
 
03:53:52.590 --> 03:53:52.600 align:start position:0%
partaking in this program and we have in
 
03:53:54.990 --> 03:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire alone over 500 firewood
 
03:53:58.030 --> 03:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
vendors listed lastly is a systems
 
03:53:59.950 --> 03:53:59.960 align:start position:0%
approach to Nursery certification this
 
03:54:02.149 --> 03:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
is called sank this promotes a
 
03:54:04.790 --> 03:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
harmonized risk-based systems approach
 
03:54:07.349 --> 03:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
to Nursery and Greenhouse production
 
03:54:09.710 --> 03:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
it's a voluntary certification program
 
03:54:11.510 --> 03:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
that was developed by the national plant
 
03:54:14.149 --> 03:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
board which my boss is a part of um as
 
03:54:16.670 --> 03:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
well as along with American Hort we have
 
03:54:19.309 --> 03:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
one sank facility in New Hampshire and
 
03:54:21.349 --> 03:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
this is actually the only facility
 
03:54:23.910 --> 03:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
Nationwide that is duy enrolled in both
 
03:54:26.110 --> 03:54:26.120 align:start position:0%
the sank program as well as the US
 
03:54:28.630 --> 03:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
Canadian Greenhouse certification
 
03:54:31.429 --> 03:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
program I will do my best to answer any
 
03:54:33.950 --> 03:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
questions you may have representative
 
03:54:37.870 --> 03:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah so I not one thing I didn't
 
03:54:39.710 --> 03:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
see on this or here you mentioned was
 
03:54:42.630 --> 03:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
the EM Emerald emerald ash borer uh
 
03:54:44.910 --> 03:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
which was um
 
03:54:47.070 --> 03:54:47.080 align:start position:0%
pretty a pretty big bit of news maybe a
 
03:54:49.590 --> 03:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
decade or so ago yes and I was wondering
 
03:54:51.110 --> 03:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
whether that's because it's under
 
03:54:52.950 --> 03:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
control or because we've lost our ash
 
03:54:52.960 --> 03:54:55.149 align:start position:0%
control or because we've lost our ash
trees

03:54:55.149 --> 03:54:55.159 align:start position:0%
trees
 
03:54:57.710 --> 03:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
or the answer is a little bit of all of
 
03:55:00.750 --> 03:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
that I will say that uh I received my my
 
03:55:02.309 --> 03:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
position was filled because Emerald
 
03:55:04.630 --> 03:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
ashor was found in New Hampshire so I
 
03:55:06.269 --> 03:55:06.279 align:start position:0%
feel like I should get that tattooed on
 
03:55:09.510 --> 03:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
me somewhere but um Emerald nbor is now
 
03:55:11.710 --> 03:55:11.720 align:start position:0%
considered widespread in New Hampshire
 
03:55:14.030 --> 03:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
but it is not Nationwide and so we do
 
03:55:15.710 --> 03:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
have to be careful about moving stuff
 
03:55:17.830 --> 03:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
out of our state the division of forest
 
03:55:21.550 --> 03:55:21.560 align:start position:0%
and lands um in the the forest and lands
 
03:55:24.149 --> 03:55:24.159 align:start position:0%
division is um they are responsible for
 
03:55:25.830 --> 03:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
the biocont control efforts and the
 
03:55:28.550 --> 03:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
monitoring of Ash currently since it's
 
03:55:30.590 --> 03:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
not really a regulatory issue anymore
 
03:55:32.229 --> 03:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
the division of plant industry has sort
 
03:55:33.469 --> 03:55:33.479 align:start position:0%
of stepped
 
03:55:37.110 --> 03:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
back so you were working on on wasps
 
03:55:38.590 --> 03:55:38.600 align:start position:0%
that were bio controlled do you know if
 
03:55:40.790 --> 03:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's been working or if that's
 
03:55:43.189 --> 03:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
yes so we have released three different
 
03:55:46.110 --> 03:55:46.120 align:start position:0%
small Paras toy to parasitic wasps in
 
03:55:48.309 --> 03:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire all of this information
 
03:55:51.189 --> 03:55:51.199 align:start position:0%
just went out in the 2024 summary
 
03:55:52.710 --> 03:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
developed by the division of forest and
 
03:55:54.269 --> 03:55:54.279 align:start position:0%
lands I believe you can find that on
 
03:55:55.950 --> 03:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
their website and I'm happy to find to
 
03:55:58.510 --> 03:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
share it um when we send you all the
 
03:56:00.110 --> 03:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
information that you've requested after
 
03:56:02.070 --> 03:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
this meeting but it's fascinating what
 
03:56:03.189 --> 03:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
they've been able to do these are
 
03:56:06.030 --> 03:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
non-stinging wasps they parasitize a
 
03:56:08.389 --> 03:56:08.399 align:start position:0%
life stage of the emerald ash for and
 
03:56:10.149 --> 03:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
we're currently releasing them in
 
03:56:11.950 --> 03:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
multiple locations throughout the state
 
03:56:15.469 --> 03:56:15.479 align:start position:0%
in Ash stands that was Master project I
 
03:56:17.910 --> 03:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
was so my Master's project was on a
 
03:56:21.870 --> 03:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
large predatory wasp that was used as
 
03:56:25.790 --> 03:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
a kind of monitoring a biom monitoring
 
03:56:29.429 --> 03:56:29.439 align:start position:0%
program and Peter's wife Jessica bulker
 
03:56:31.389 --> 03:56:31.399 align:start position:0%
was one of my advisers which is how we
 
03:56:34.189 --> 03:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
know each other yes it was fun playing
 
03:56:36.110 --> 03:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
with wasps for a couple of
 
03:56:39.309 --> 03:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
Summers very charismatic thank you
 
03:56:41.070 --> 03:56:41.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate all your information you're
 
03:57:00.750 --> 03:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:03.389 --> 03:57:03.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'll be extremely brief
 
03:57:06.510 --> 03:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
uh it's it is my name is Al W and I am
 
03:57:08.510 --> 03:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
the division director of regulatory
 
03:57:10.070 --> 03:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
services for the Department of
 
03:57:12.630 --> 03:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
Agriculture it is nice to see friendly
 
03:57:14.830 --> 03:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
and in recognizable faces and it's
 
03:57:16.710 --> 03:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
exciting to see some new faces it's a
 
03:57:19.389 --> 03:57:19.399 align:start position:0%
great committee um as as commissioner
 
03:57:21.189 --> 03:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
said initially if you have questions
 
03:57:23.229 --> 03:57:23.239 align:start position:0%
when you are looking at lsrs and so
 
03:57:25.030 --> 03:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
forth give them a call and if it
 
03:57:27.149 --> 03:57:27.159 align:start position:0%
involves any of us in the division we'd
 
03:57:29.030 --> 03:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
love to assist you I mean it's it's
 
03:57:30.469 --> 03:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
worked great there's a lot of
 
03:57:33.189 --> 03:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
legislation that comes through that that
 
03:57:36.429 --> 03:57:36.439 align:start position:0%
requires I believe uh clarification as
 
03:57:38.750 --> 03:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
to how we might Implement those or or
 
03:57:40.349 --> 03:57:40.359 align:start position:0%
the potential impacts associated with
 
03:57:42.349 --> 03:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
implementation so that's of all like
 
03:57:43.950 --> 03:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
taking Dave's lead of all the things I
 
03:57:47.149 --> 03:57:47.159 align:start position:0%
want do is emphasize that relative to
 
03:57:48.510 --> 03:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
what we do as a division if you were
 
03:57:51.030 --> 03:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
have srel down to the end of it what we
 
03:57:52.790 --> 03:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
really do it's it's it's it's human
 
03:57:55.590 --> 03:57:55.600 align:start position:0%
health and safety I mean it's labeling
 
03:57:55.600 --> 03:57:56.550 align:start position:0%
health and safety I mean it's labeling
it's

03:57:56.550 --> 03:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:57:59.710 --> 03:57:59.720 align:start position:0%
inspections uh the whole point and
 
03:58:01.950 --> 03:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
purpose for that is so at the end of the
 
03:58:05.670 --> 03:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
day um we have a handle on what's being
 
03:58:07.550 --> 03:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
distributed throughout the state and if
 
03:58:09.790 --> 03:58:09.800 align:start position:0%
we have recalls that are necessary we
 
03:58:12.030 --> 03:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
can jump on those right but it's
 
03:58:14.269 --> 03:58:14.279 align:start position:0%
critical that the that labeling be be
 
03:58:16.990 --> 03:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
correct uh for that purpose so we go out
 
03:58:19.630 --> 03:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
we'll do inspections relative to uh to
 
03:58:21.910 --> 03:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
assuring that we can we can do that we
 
03:58:26.070 --> 03:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
also deal um now we deal in in three
 
03:58:29.590 --> 03:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
primary um we exist in really in three
 
03:58:32.149 --> 03:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
ways we do we represent a lot of of of
 
03:58:35.910 --> 03:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
federal law and our inspectors are
 
03:58:38.750 --> 03:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh issued the authority by federal
 
03:58:40.269 --> 03:58:40.279 align:start position:0%
government to do certain inspections
 
03:58:41.910 --> 03:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
associated with the uh growth of of
 
03:58:45.070 --> 03:58:45.080 align:start position:0%
vegetables right uh the point being
 
03:58:47.790 --> 03:58:47.800 align:start position:0%
the proper
 
03:58:50.710 --> 03:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
handling growth and handling of the
 
03:58:52.950 --> 03:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
material before it gets to Consumers is
 
03:58:55.110 --> 03:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
critical because of some of these
 
03:58:57.030 --> 03:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
pathogens that pass on with the
 
03:58:58.710 --> 03:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
vegetables so we'll go out and we'll do
 
03:59:00.910 --> 03:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
inspections to assure that the handling
 
03:59:02.590 --> 03:59:02.600 align:start position:0%
is proper such that we don't end up with
 
03:59:04.269 --> 03:59:04.279 align:start position:0%
an outbreak to begin with that we then
 
03:59:06.309 --> 03:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
have to go back and Trace right um so
 
03:59:08.269 --> 03:59:08.279 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of components to that a
 
03:59:13.389 --> 03:59:13.399 align:start position:0%
lot of pieces um a second one is we work
 
03:59:16.309 --> 03:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
on the National level with organizations
 
03:59:19.269 --> 03:59:19.279 align:start position:0%
that will develop uh example laws and
 
03:59:21.550 --> 03:59:21.560 align:start position:0%
rules for consideration by each state
 
03:59:23.389 --> 03:59:23.399 align:start position:0%
Across the Nation so that manufacturers
 
03:59:26.790 --> 03:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
only have to produce to one set of of of
 
03:59:29.710 --> 03:59:29.720 align:start position:0%
requirements and in that we have
 
03:59:32.790 --> 03:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
toxicologists uh professors
 
03:59:35.149 --> 03:59:35.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturing experts control officials
 
03:59:38.550 --> 03:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
from every state get we get together we
 
03:59:41.269 --> 03:59:41.279 align:start position:0%
use S uh really good scientific basis to
 
03:59:42.910 --> 03:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
to to make recommendations to you guys
 
03:59:45.910 --> 03:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
as as to what might might be appropriate
 
03:59:47.229 --> 03:59:47.239 align:start position:0%
and in the case coming forward you'll
 
03:59:49.070 --> 03:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
see something associated with bio
 
03:59:51.750 --> 03:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
stimulants um
 
03:59:54.269 --> 03:59:54.279 align:start position:0%
uh recently there was some changes to
 
03:59:56.189 --> 03:59:56.199 align:start position:0%
fertilizer these are all things you're
 
03:59:57.790 --> 03:59:57.800 align:start position:0%
going to look at you may interact with
 
04:00:00.269 --> 04:00:00.279 align:start position:0%
us to ask questions associated with that
 
04:00:05.189 --> 04:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
um we do pet food and there is a
 
04:00:06.630 --> 04:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
component in Pet Food associated with
 
04:00:09.510 --> 04:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
sampling it's not just labeling and in
 
04:00:12.229 --> 04:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
assuring that we can backtrack but when
 
04:00:14.110 --> 04:00:14.120 align:start position:0%
a when a registration comes in it
 
04:00:15.990 --> 04:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
identifies what the con uh contents of
 
04:00:18.349 --> 04:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
that pet food is and we have an expert
 
04:00:19.790 --> 04:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
who just looks through that day in and
 
04:00:22.469 --> 04:00:22.479 align:start position:0%
day out and and and is looking for
 
04:00:24.510 --> 04:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
ingredients in in that pet food that
 
04:00:27.510 --> 04:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
could be harmful um and typically when
 
04:00:29.070 --> 04:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
we run into those issues it's it's it's
 
04:00:30.870 --> 04:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
not the larger companies because they
 
04:00:32.229 --> 04:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
have Experts of their own that they can
 
04:00:34.070 --> 04:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
hire It's usually the smaller companies
 
04:00:35.950 --> 04:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
it's usually people within New Hampshire
 
04:00:37.630 --> 04:00:37.640 align:start position:0%
who are who are producing wanting to
 
04:00:39.950 --> 04:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
sell that they may not have that
 
04:00:42.110 --> 04:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
technical expertise so we'll step in
 
04:00:44.590 --> 04:00:44.600 align:start position:0%
after a review and we we'll call them so
 
04:00:46.710 --> 04:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
here's our concern we can't register
 
04:00:47.990 --> 04:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
this product we can't allow you to sell
 
04:00:50.590 --> 04:00:50.600 align:start position:0%
it for these reasons and we everything
 
04:00:54.510 --> 04:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
we do we try to work with everybody to
 
04:00:56.229 --> 04:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
the best of our ability to get them to
 
04:00:58.070 --> 04:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
be able to sell their product our
 
04:01:00.550 --> 04:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
objective is not to stop anybody it's
 
04:01:03.229 --> 04:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
it's human health and safety um it's
 
04:01:07.070 --> 04:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
also pet safety
 
04:01:09.229 --> 04:01:09.239 align:start position:0%
so I don't know I'm really encouraged by
 
04:01:10.910 --> 04:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
that because I I I get good feedback
 
04:01:14.590 --> 04:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
that that my staff is great um
 
04:01:17.070 --> 04:01:17.080 align:start position:0%
and helpful in in that aspect we also
 
04:01:19.830 --> 04:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
deal with specific rsas that were driven
 
04:01:23.229 --> 04:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
not by national not by federal but by
 
04:01:24.710 --> 04:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
the citizenry of the State of New
 
04:01:27.309 --> 04:01:27.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that includes um things
 
04:01:30.429 --> 04:01:30.439 align:start position:0%
like local local marketing somebody
 
04:01:32.149 --> 04:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
spoke about agricultural land and
 
04:01:33.950 --> 04:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
protecting agricultural land we have an
 
04:01:36.950 --> 04:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
Alp Pro uh program where if it's
 
04:01:39.469 --> 04:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
properly funded we uh have the
 
04:01:41.469 --> 04:01:41.479 align:start position:0%
capability of going out and
 
04:01:44.349 --> 04:01:44.359 align:start position:0%
purchasing the rights to land in
 
04:01:45.469 --> 04:01:45.479 align:start position:0%
perpetuity for the purpose of
 
04:01:47.349 --> 04:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
Agriculture I mean in my opinion the
 
04:01:48.750 --> 04:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
only way you're going to save a
 
04:01:50.950 --> 04:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
agriculture is by setting that land in
 
04:01:52.670 --> 04:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
perpetuity for that purpose because
 
04:01:54.750 --> 04:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
nobody no government entity has the
 
04:01:56.750 --> 04:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
right to come in and say you can't sell
 
04:01:59.550 --> 04:01:59.560 align:start position:0%
your land right it's a really important
 
04:02:01.429 --> 04:02:01.439 align:start position:0%
for for people who feel that uh
 
04:02:03.389 --> 04:02:03.399 align:start position:0%
preservation of agriculture in the state
 
04:02:04.710 --> 04:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire is important that's an
 
04:02:07.510 --> 04:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
important program but has to be funded
 
04:02:10.510 --> 04:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
um we do thanks and we we we also work a
 
04:02:13.469 --> 04:02:13.479 align:start position:0%
lot with uh New Hampshire um extension
 
04:02:16.670 --> 04:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
over at UNH great program I I agree with
 
04:02:19.630 --> 04:02:19.640 align:start position:0%
everybody we we have we work C and glove
 
04:02:21.030 --> 04:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh on a on a couple of different
 
04:02:23.469 --> 04:02:23.479 align:start position:0%
programs the the registration of
 
04:02:24.990 --> 04:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
uninspected rabbits and poultry for
 
04:02:27.189 --> 04:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
instance uh Lumber grading there's a lot
 
04:02:28.349 --> 04:02:28.359 align:start position:0%
of people in New Hampshire make their
 
04:02:31.590 --> 04:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
own Lumber and build with it so you have
 
04:02:33.469 --> 04:02:33.479 align:start position:0%
to have an expert who's capable of
 
04:02:35.590 --> 04:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
looking at that saying yeah that's safe
 
04:02:39.750 --> 04:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
right um the Seal of uh quality program
 
04:02:41.710 --> 04:02:41.720 align:start position:0%
great program where staff will go out
 
04:02:44.510 --> 04:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
and you know you have fsma you have Gap
 
04:02:46.149 --> 04:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
you have those are federal and you have
 
04:02:47.590 --> 04:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire seal of quality where our
 
04:02:49.950 --> 04:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
staff will go out and and even take a
 
04:02:54.030 --> 04:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
step above and do inspections and and
 
04:02:57.670 --> 04:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
expectations in the way product is
 
04:02:59.429 --> 04:02:59.439 align:start position:0%
produced grown and produced and
 
04:03:03.110 --> 04:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
presented in such a manner that it is of
 
04:03:06.830 --> 04:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
a very high quality and once they pass
 
04:03:08.990 --> 04:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
that and it's a yearly inspection we
 
04:03:12.149 --> 04:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
have to document everything as as they
 
04:03:13.870 --> 04:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
can use that sticker on their product
 
04:03:18.469 --> 04:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
seal of quality um there's 14 programs
 
04:03:20.910 --> 04:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
that fall under my Division I can I
 
04:03:22.630 --> 04:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
can't get into the detail associated
 
04:03:24.710 --> 04:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
with with all of them but your your
 
04:03:28.550 --> 04:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
packet here uh it does a good job of of
 
04:03:30.229 --> 04:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
at least presenting what they are and if
 
04:03:32.670 --> 04:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
you go on to our website I think you'll
 
04:03:34.990 --> 04:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
you'll find uh really good descriptions
 
04:03:37.349 --> 04:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
of what each one of those uh programs
 
04:03:39.590 --> 04:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
are the last thing I'd like to say and
 
04:03:41.870 --> 04:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
and I'd like
 
04:03:44.269 --> 04:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
to representative bigs
 
04:03:47.070 --> 04:03:47.080 align:start position:0%
spoke to this earlier in that we have in
 
04:03:49.910 --> 04:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
this division been going through our
 
04:03:54.110 --> 04:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
laws and really modernizing and taking
 
04:03:56.990 --> 04:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
out laws that mandat things that we're
 
04:03:59.070 --> 04:03:59.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to do that we simply can't do
 
04:04:01.750 --> 04:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
or that just don't make sense anymore
 
04:04:03.149 --> 04:04:03.159 align:start position:0%
and I think last time we got rid of
 
04:04:04.710 --> 04:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
something like 40 paragraphs it was it
 
04:04:07.630 --> 04:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
was great it's I thankful for it because
 
04:04:09.189 --> 04:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
now I'm not being pushed to do things
 
04:04:12.030 --> 04:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
like look for bone and coal for instance
 
04:04:14.790 --> 04:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
right I mean silly thing but when the
 
04:04:17.149 --> 04:04:17.159 align:start position:0%
law says shall there's a consideration
 
04:04:19.429 --> 04:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
there that I have to take um you'll see
 
04:04:21.189 --> 04:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
some things coming I I mentioned it bio
 
04:04:23.189 --> 04:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
stimulant Trace first is our
 
04:04:24.910 --> 04:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
registration monetization program that's
 
04:04:26.790 --> 04:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
going across the whole department I
 
04:04:28.469 --> 04:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
can't say enough about that we've been
 
04:04:30.990 --> 04:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
living in the 80s relative to how we
 
04:04:32.830 --> 04:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
deal with paperwork that's my my opinion
 
04:04:35.269 --> 04:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
this will bring things in into uh into
 
04:04:37.870 --> 04:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
the current so that we can start to
 
04:04:40.750 --> 04:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
really get a grip on what we're doing
 
04:04:41.910 --> 04:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
how we're doing it I mean that was a
 
04:04:43.429 --> 04:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
question we had earlier how do we what
 
04:04:45.670 --> 04:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
are the metrics right well well once we
 
04:04:46.990 --> 04:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
have these programs in place it's going
 
04:04:48.309 --> 04:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
to be a lot easier to figure out what
 
04:04:51.429 --> 04:04:51.439 align:start position:0%
those metrics might be um uh we just had
 
04:04:53.910 --> 04:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
a recently we had fertilizer requirement

work with our Water Division um so we
 
04:13:42.750 --> 04:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to be before
 
04:13:44.910 --> 04:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
you today um we really we recognize
 
04:13:46.550 --> 04:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot we do and you've heard a
 
04:13:48.790 --> 04:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
lot probably already today and there's a
 
04:13:50.710 --> 04:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
lot we could share so we've given you a
 
04:13:52.229 --> 04:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
presentation it's pretty thorough it
 
04:13:54.870 --> 04:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
gives you several slides dedicated to
 
04:13:57.109 --> 04:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
each Bureau um but we're not going to
 
04:13:59.149 --> 04:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
talk to each one of those components of
 
04:14:00.109 --> 04:14:00.119 align:start position:0%
those slides we're going to go a little
 
04:14:01.990 --> 04:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
more highflying so we can we're going to
 
04:14:04.189 --> 04:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
shoot for probably Sarah and I
 
04:14:06.109 --> 04:14:06.119 align:start position:0%
completing our presentation in about 30
 
04:14:08.109 --> 04:14:08.119 align:start position:0%
minutes and then I think Amy might have
 
04:14:10.070 --> 04:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
five or 10 minutes she'd like to present
 
04:14:12.269 --> 04:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
to you on invasive species and then of
 
04:14:13.790 --> 04:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
course we're at your pleasure we'll be
 
04:14:15.990 --> 04:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
happy to entertain any questions great
 
04:14:19.149 --> 04:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
thank you so much so with that um the
 
04:14:21.149 --> 04:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
first slide our senior management team I
 
04:14:22.830 --> 04:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
think many of you know but perhaps not
 
04:14:24.710 --> 04:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
all of you um our commissioner is Bob
 
04:14:27.630 --> 04:14:27.640 align:start position:0%
Scott our assistant commissioner is Adam
 
04:14:30.830 --> 04:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
kpo and then um Susan Carl Carlson is
 
04:14:33.630 --> 04:14:33.640 align:start position:0%
our chief operations officer and then uh
 
04:14:34.830 --> 04:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
I serve as director of the waste
 
04:14:36.790 --> 04:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
division Craig Wright is director of our
 
04:14:39.670 --> 04:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
air Resources Division and rainy peler
 
04:14:41.590 --> 04:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
is our Water Division
 
04:14:43.710 --> 04:14:43.720 align:start position:0%
director next slide
 
04:14:46.469 --> 04:14:46.479 align:start position:0%
so then our division is uh essentially
 
04:14:49.870 --> 04:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
comprised of five bureaus and um this
 
04:14:51.349 --> 04:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
graphic here gives you an idea of the
 
04:14:53.870 --> 04:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
overarching sort of categories of
 
04:14:56.229 --> 04:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that each Bureau um
 
04:14:58.070 --> 04:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
covers um we're going to be talking
 
04:15:01.469 --> 04:15:01.479 align:start position:0%
about those in some detail uh in as as
 
04:15:03.710 --> 04:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
we talk about the individual
 
04:15:06.590 --> 04:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
bureaus and so um but if we look for
 
04:15:08.469 --> 04:15:08.479 align:start position:0%
stay high level for just a moment about
 
04:15:11.229 --> 04:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
the whole sort of division's uh goals
 
04:15:13.389 --> 04:15:13.399 align:start position:0%
and responsibilities are primary
 
04:15:14.670 --> 04:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility is really about
 
04:15:16.269 --> 04:15:16.279 align:start position:0%
protection of Public Health in the
 
04:15:18.550 --> 04:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
environment that's in in virtually all
 
04:15:21.229 --> 04:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
the statutory uh Provisions that apply
 
04:15:24.030 --> 04:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
to our division and um we do that um
 
04:15:25.670 --> 04:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
through a combination of really trying
 
04:15:27.670 --> 04:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
to avoid and prevent releases of
 
04:15:29.590 --> 04:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
contaminants and materials that can harm
 
04:15:31.990 --> 04:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
human health the environment um and that
 
04:15:34.269 --> 04:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
includes we we accomplished that
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
specifically for petroleum products
 
04:15:38.590 --> 04:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste and solid waste um and
 
04:15:39.670 --> 04:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
we try to do that through public
 
04:15:41.830 --> 04:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
Outreach through technical assistance
 
04:15:43.790 --> 04:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
and training of the regul community and
 
04:15:45.550 --> 04:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
we you'll hear today about a number of
 
04:15:47.189 --> 04:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
formalized training programs that we
 
04:15:49.269 --> 04:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
provide for some of our regulated
 
04:15:51.870 --> 04:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
parties and we also uh when when we
 
04:15:53.630 --> 04:15:53.640 align:start position:0%
aren't so successful in preventing those
 
04:15:56.389 --> 04:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
releases uh we have a response program
 
04:15:58.149 --> 04:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
and then a remediation programs that
 
04:16:00.309 --> 04:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
help to address the impacts of any
 
04:16:02.750 --> 04:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
releases and contaminants so we do
 
04:16:07.269 --> 04:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
provide um 247 365 day per year uh
 
04:16:09.830 --> 04:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
response capability for response to O
 
04:16:12.149 --> 04:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
oil and hazardous materials incidents
 
04:16:14.550 --> 04:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
that same group group of responders also
 
04:16:16.670 --> 04:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh routinely responds to Citizen compl
 
04:16:19.950 --> 04:16:19.960 align:start position:0%
and investigates citizen complaints um
 
04:16:22.710 --> 04:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
we have uh they also engage in response
 
04:16:25.710 --> 04:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
uh preparedness planning both Inland on
 
04:16:27.510 --> 04:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
the Inland Waters with respect to
 
04:16:29.429 --> 04:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
potential oil spills as well as on the
 
04:16:32.510 --> 04:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast region and then um we do put a
 
04:16:34.349 --> 04:16:34.359 align:start position:0%
lot of work into contaminated site
 
04:16:36.950 --> 04:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
investigation remediation and Mitigation
 
04:16:38.790 --> 04:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
Of contaminated drinking water and you
 
04:16:40.550 --> 04:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
hear about some examples of those as we
 
04:16:43.309 --> 04:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
talk about each of the bureaus so with
 
04:16:45.149 --> 04:16:45.159 align:start position:0%
that um I want to turn it over to Sarah
 
04:16:46.870 --> 04:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
to talk about um our first Bureau which
 
04:16:48.990 --> 04:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
is oil remediation and compliance
 
04:16:52.790 --> 04:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
Bureau thank you the oil remediation and
 
04:16:56.149 --> 04:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
compliance Bureau is a team of
 
04:16:58.189 --> 04:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologists Engineers and
 
04:17:00.910 --> 04:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
environmental scientists that is headed
 
04:17:04.229 --> 04:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
up by their administrator Bob bishop and
 
04:17:07.189 --> 04:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
Bob is here
 
04:17:10.550 --> 04:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
today and the purpose of this Bureau is
 
04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
to deal with the problem of pollution
 
04:17:15.950 --> 04:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
from petroleum releases and we'll get
 
04:17:17.550 --> 04:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
into a little bit of how they do that
 
04:17:21.469 --> 04:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
but what it boils down to is making sure
 
04:17:23.429 --> 04:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
that petroleum that is stored in the
 
04:17:25.670 --> 04:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
state stays where it belongs that it
 
04:17:28.389 --> 04:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
stays in the tank systems that it's in
 
04:17:30.630 --> 04:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
making sure if a spill happens that it
 
04:17:33.189 --> 04:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
gets cleaned up quickly and
 
04:17:35.830 --> 04:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
effectively for petroleum contamination
 
04:17:38.229 --> 04:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
that is lingering in the environment
 
04:17:39.830 --> 04:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
making sure that the appropriate
 
04:17:41.950 --> 04:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
Technologies are applied to get it
 
04:17:44.710 --> 04:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
cleaned up and that it is monitored and
 
04:17:46.590 --> 04:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
the health risks uh potential health
 
04:17:48.469 --> 04:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
health risks associated with it are
 
04:17:51.790 --> 04:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
mitigated and then providing assistance
 
04:17:54.590 --> 04:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
for funding for the cleanups of these
 
04:17:57.590 --> 04:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
releases which can be
 
04:18:00.349 --> 04:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
costly the first section that we will
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
talk about is the oil compliance section
 
04:18:06.469 --> 04:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
and as you can see on this slide between
 
04:18:08.790 --> 04:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
the underground storage tanks and above
 
04:18:11.070 --> 04:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
ground storage tanks storing Petroleum
 
04:18:13.269 --> 04:18:13.279 align:start position:0%
in the state at any given time there's
 
04:18:15.950 --> 04:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
about 200 million gallons of petroleum
 
04:18:15.960 --> 04:18:17.670 align:start position:0%
about 200 million gallons of petroleum
being

04:18:17.670 --> 04:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:18:20.750 --> 04:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
stored so uh what the oil compliance
 
04:18:23.550 --> 04:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
section does is it works to eliminate
 
04:18:26.590 --> 04:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
the possibility of spills by carefully
 
04:18:29.109 --> 04:18:29.119 align:start position:0%
permitting engineered storage
 
04:18:32.030 --> 04:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
systems by educating the folks who
 
04:18:33.830 --> 04:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
operate those storage systems to make
 
04:18:35.750 --> 04:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
sure that they're maintained properly so
 
04:18:38.670 --> 04:18:38.680 align:start position:0%
that releases don't occur and by
 
04:18:41.429 --> 04:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
conducting regular inspections so that
 
04:18:43.229 --> 04:18:43.239 align:start position:0%
we can identify conditions that might
 
04:18:44.590 --> 04:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
allow a
 
04:18:47.630 --> 04:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
release our oil compliance section is
 
04:18:51.469 --> 04:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
authorized to regulate petroleum and
 
04:18:53.550 --> 04:18:53.560 align:start position:0%
hazardous substance storage in
 
04:18:56.429 --> 04:18:56.439 align:start position:0%
underground storage tanks petroleum
 
04:18:59.309 --> 04:18:59.319 align:start position:0%
storage in above ground storage tanks
 
04:19:01.550 --> 04:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
but in both those cases uh an exception
 
04:19:04.070 --> 04:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
is Residential Heating Oil like what you
 
04:19:07.229 --> 04:19:07.239 align:start position:0%
may have at your house is not regulated
 
04:19:10.910 --> 04:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:13.990 --> 04:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
program the oil compliance section
 
04:19:16.990 --> 04:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
reviews uh for underground storage tanks
 
04:19:21.109 --> 04:19:21.119 align:start position:0%
about 50 designs per year to see if
 
04:19:23.070 --> 04:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
they're compliant with the rules for
 
04:19:27.109 --> 04:19:27.119 align:start position:0%
storage tank systems um and they inspect
 
04:19:30.550 --> 04:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
after the approval of a of a plan and
 
04:19:32.510 --> 04:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
design to be sure that the system is
 
04:19:34.309 --> 04:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
constructed in accordance with the
 
04:19:36.950 --> 04:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
design now these designs can be either
 
04:19:39.429 --> 04:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
for new facilities or for existing
 
04:19:41.269 --> 04:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
facilities that are being
 
04:19:43.550 --> 04:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
modified and they also conduct
 
04:19:45.910 --> 04:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
inspections of underground storage
 
04:19:49.229 --> 04:19:49.239 align:start position:0%
facilities once every 3 years for each
 
04:19:52.389 --> 04:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
facility for above ground storage tanks
 
04:19:55.750 --> 04:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
we see about 25 designs per year that we
 
04:19:59.790 --> 04:19:59.800 align:start position:0%
review both for new and modified systems
 
04:20:02.469 --> 04:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
and uh historically the above ground
 
04:20:04.670 --> 04:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
storage tank systems were inspected when
 
04:20:07.670 --> 04:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
there was a problem expect that we
 
04:20:09.070 --> 04:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
thought might be there or when there was
 
04:20:11.910 --> 04:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
a complaint what we're working to do now
 
04:20:14.590 --> 04:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
is to develop a program where those
 
04:20:16.349 --> 04:20:16.359 align:start position:0%
above ground storage systems are
 
04:20:18.870 --> 04:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
inspected on a regular basis as well as
 
04:20:23.229 --> 04:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:27.030 --> 04:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
systems when the oil doesn't stay where
 
04:20:29.590 --> 04:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
it should that's when we get into spill
 
04:20:32.469 --> 04:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
response in our oil remediation and
 
04:20:35.189 --> 04:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
compliance Bureau we call it or RCB we
 
04:20:37.630 --> 04:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
have the spill response and complaint
 
04:20:40.149 --> 04:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
investigation section like director
 
04:20:43.790 --> 04:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
whims mentioned this group is on call 24
 
04:20:46.229 --> 04:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
hours a day 7 days a week during all
 
04:20:48.950 --> 04:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
holidays to respond to releases of
 
04:20:51.950 --> 04:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
petroleum and other Haz hazardous sub
 
04:20:54.910 --> 04:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
substances that occur and these folks
 
04:20:57.910 --> 04:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
have extensive training so that they're
 
04:21:00.590 --> 04:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
able to manage hazardous material
 
04:21:03.429 --> 04:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
emergencies in the most protective and
 
04:21:05.269 --> 04:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
effective way to protect human health
 
04:21:08.030 --> 04:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
and environmental
 
04:21:10.790 --> 04:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
resources they respond to approximately
 
04:21:14.950 --> 04:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
300 spills per year in the state and
 
04:21:17.830 --> 04:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
about 90% of those spills involve
 
04:21:20.149 --> 04:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
petroleum um I say involve petroleum
 
04:21:22.309 --> 04:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
because it might be petroleum as well as
 
04:21:24.510 --> 04:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
another hazardous
 
04:21:27.670 --> 04:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
substance you saw in a previous slide
 
04:21:30.149 --> 04:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
that there's approximately
 
04:21:33.790 --> 04:21:33.800 align:start position:0%
156 million gallons of oil stored in
 
04:21:36.269 --> 04:21:36.279 align:start position:0%
above ground storage tanks in the state
 
04:21:38.510 --> 04:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
and most of that storage is on the coast
 
04:21:40.790 --> 04:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire right there near Great
 
04:21:44.710 --> 04:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
Bay so our spill response folks have uh
 
04:21:47.830 --> 04:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
created extensive plans for protecting
 
04:21:50.030 --> 04:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
the resources like in Great Bay if there
 
04:21:52.670 --> 04:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
is a large scale oil
 
04:21:57.469 --> 04:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
spill and they also uh conduct regular
 
04:22:00.950 --> 04:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
drills of those plans to respond to
 
04:22:06.389 --> 04:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:10.189 --> 04:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
coast another duty of this section is
 
04:22:13.269 --> 04:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
that they investigate complaints of
 
04:22:15.630 --> 04:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
mismanagement of
 
04:22:18.790 --> 04:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
petroleum um hazardous materials and
 
04:22:21.469 --> 04:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
solid waste throughout the state so we
 
04:22:23.590 --> 04:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
keep those folks
 
04:22:27.229 --> 04:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
busy another section of or RCB is the
 
04:22:30.630 --> 04:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
petroleum remediation section this group
 
04:22:33.750 --> 04:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
focuses on mitigating the long-term
 
04:22:37.189 --> 04:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
impacts of petroleum releases um many of
 
04:22:39.830 --> 04:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
the sites that are being cleaned up or
 
04:22:42.030 --> 04:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
monitored by the petroleum remediation
 
04:22:42.040 --> 04:22:42.990 align:start position:0%
monitored by the petroleum remediation
section

04:22:42.990 --> 04:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:22:45.790 --> 04:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
have been around a long time um many of
 
04:22:48.149 --> 04:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
the releases occurred before the
 
04:22:51.630 --> 04:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
regulations for storage of oil that oil
 
04:22:54.309 --> 04:22:54.319 align:start position:0%
compliance overseas were as robust as
 
04:22:56.910 --> 04:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
they are now and the goal of the
 
04:22:59.189 --> 04:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
petroleum remediation section where
 
04:23:01.189 --> 04:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
there's contamination is to return
 
04:23:03.070 --> 04:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
groundwater quality to meet drinking
 
04:23:06.269 --> 04:23:06.279 align:start position:0%
water standards and to mitigate the
 
04:23:09.750 --> 04:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
potential impacts to human health from
 
04:23:11.149 --> 04:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
petroleum contamination in the
 
04:23:14.309 --> 04:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
groundwater to tect people to mitigate
 
04:23:16.910 --> 04:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
um petroleum contaminated drinking water
 
04:23:20.349 --> 04:23:20.359 align:start position:0%
supplies and uh to mitigate indoor air
 
04:23:22.550 --> 04:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
problems when a petroleum spill occurs
 
04:23:24.269 --> 04:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
close to a building and it impacts the
 
04:23:24.279 --> 04:23:28.870 align:start position:0%
close to a building and it impacts the
indoor

04:23:28.870 --> 04:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:32.590 --> 04:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
air and the the last section in or RCB
 
04:23:34.590 --> 04:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to talk about is the fund
 
04:23:36.910 --> 04:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
management section as you can imagine
 
04:23:38.429 --> 04:23:38.439 align:start position:0%
the cost of these cleanups that we're
 
04:23:41.870 --> 04:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
discussing can be very high so high that
 
04:23:44.389 --> 04:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
um even companies with resources have a
 
04:23:47.070 --> 04:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
hard time getting the cleanups done in a
 
04:23:48.710 --> 04:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
timely fashion unless they have some
 
04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
assistance the oil discharge and
 
04:23:56.590 --> 04:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
Disposal cleanup fund was set up by RSA
 
04:24:01.590 --> 04:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
146d and that uh reimburses for costs to
 
04:24:04.109 --> 04:24:04.119 align:start position:0%
clean up petroleum contamination at
 
04:24:04.119 --> 04:24:05.389 align:start position:0%
clean up petroleum contamination at
eligible

04:24:05.389 --> 04:24:05.399 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
04:24:08.389 --> 04:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
sites in addition to assisting with the
 
04:24:10.269 --> 04:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
economic impacts associated with
 
04:24:13.349 --> 04:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
petroleum contamination this fund
 
04:24:16.349 --> 04:24:16.359 align:start position:0%
satisfies a federal requirement that
 
04:24:18.189 --> 04:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
facilities like gas stations need to
 
04:24:20.750 --> 04:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
have Financial Assurance many of these
 
04:24:23.710 --> 04:24:23.720 align:start position:0%
facilities would find it hard to find
 
04:24:25.510 --> 04:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
High Enough insurance coverage or too
 
04:24:27.830 --> 04:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
expensive to obtain that insurance
 
04:24:32.070 --> 04:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
coverage and this fund serves to fulfill
 
04:24:33.750 --> 04:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
that Federal
 
04:24:36.670 --> 04:24:36.680 align:start position:0%
requirement the fund management section
 
04:24:39.109 --> 04:24:39.119 align:start position:0%
administers the oil oil discharge and
 
04:24:43.109 --> 04:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
Disposal fund on behalf of the oil
 
04:24:45.910 --> 04:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
discharge and Disposal fund dispersement
 
04:24:48.389 --> 04:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
board um and that board consists of
 
04:24:50.790 --> 04:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
folks who are appointed by the
 
04:24:53.149 --> 04:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
governor um the board approves the use
 
04:24:55.790 --> 04:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
of the fund for cleanup purposes for oil
 
04:25:00.309 --> 04:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
and spill response purposes including um
 
04:25:02.189 --> 04:25:02.199 align:start position:0%
it has authorized what we call the safe
 
04:25:05.030 --> 04:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
tank program which is a program that
 
04:25:07.510 --> 04:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
assists lowincome homeowners in New
 
04:25:09.510 --> 04:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with replacing their home
 
04:25:11.870 --> 04:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
heating oil tanks that are failing or
 
04:25:13.830 --> 04:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
about ready ready to fail and in that
 
04:25:16.910 --> 04:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
way the fund helps prevent many releases
 
04:25:18.670 --> 04:25:18.680 align:start position:0%
of heating oil that would otherwise
 
04:25:21.469 --> 04:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:23.630 --> 04:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
year that concludes the discussion of
 
04:25:25.149 --> 04:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
the oil remediation and compliance
 
04:25:27.269 --> 04:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
Bureau and next I'd like to talk about
 
04:25:29.590 --> 04:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
the Hazardous Waste remediation Bureau
 
04:25:31.830 --> 04:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
which has some similarities to the oil
 
04:25:34.309 --> 04:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
remediation compliance Bureau but this
 
04:25:37.229 --> 04:25:37.239 align:start position:0%
group focuses on overseeing
 
04:25:40.030 --> 04:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
investigation and cleanup of regulated
 
04:25:41.790 --> 04:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
contaminants that are not related to
 
04:25:41.800 --> 04:25:43.030 align:start position:0%
contaminants that are not related to
petroleum

04:25:43.030 --> 04:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
petroleum
 
04:25:45.630 --> 04:25:45.640 align:start position:0%
and it's a group of hydrogeologists and
 
04:25:48.149 --> 04:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
Engineers that are headed up by Jeff
 
04:25:50.550 --> 04:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
Marts the bureau administrator who's
 
04:25:53.109 --> 04:25:53.119 align:start position:0%
right here thanks
 
04:25:55.469 --> 04:25:55.479 align:start position:0%
Jeff the Hazardous Waste remediation
 
04:25:59.309 --> 04:25:59.319 align:start position:0%
Bureau is uh divided into two sections
 
04:26:01.349 --> 04:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
the state sites section and the
 
04:26:04.229 --> 04:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
federally LED sites section we'll talk
 
04:26:07.229 --> 04:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
about State sites first uh that group is
 
04:26:09.870 --> 04:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
further divided into the emerging
 
04:26:12.030 --> 04:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
contaminants program the brownfields
 
04:26:13.990 --> 04:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
program program and the groundwater
 
04:26:16.510 --> 04:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
remediation and permitting program and
 
04:26:18.550 --> 04:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
collectively these subsections are
 
04:26:22.429 --> 04:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
responsible for regulatory oversight of
 
04:26:25.750 --> 04:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
hazardous waist sites monitor monitoring
 
04:26:29.309 --> 04:26:29.319 align:start position:0%
of closed unlined landfills monitoring
 
04:26:31.670 --> 04:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
of active Solid Waste
 
04:26:34.830 --> 04:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
landfills um release detection
 
04:26:37.750 --> 04:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
permitting and also for work at
 
04:26:37.760 --> 04:26:39.269 align:start position:0%
permitting and also for work at
Brownfield

04:26:39.269 --> 04:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
Brownfield
 
04:26:43.189 --> 04:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
sites the brownfields program helps to
 
04:26:43.199 --> 04:26:44.910 align:start position:0%
sites the brownfields program helps to
revitalize

04:26:44.910 --> 04:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
revitalize
 
04:26:47.429 --> 04:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
underutilized contaminated Andor
 
04:26:49.670 --> 04:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
abandoned properties in the state by
 
04:26:51.790 --> 04:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
helping to bring them back into active
 
04:26:54.750 --> 04:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
reuse the folks in this program work
 
04:26:57.750 --> 04:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
with uh Federal funding and help
 
04:27:01.030 --> 04:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
communities to investigate and clean up
 
04:27:03.870 --> 04:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
sites in their towns so that they can
 
04:27:07.510 --> 04:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
make better use of those properties this
 
04:27:09.830 --> 04:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh slide here summarizes some of the
 
04:27:11.830 --> 04:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
work of the brownfields program that's
 
04:27:14.349 --> 04:27:14.359 align:start position:0%
going on right now oh the brownfields
 
04:27:16.710 --> 04:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
program also administers what's called a
 
04:27:19.590 --> 04:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
covenant not to sue program and that's a
 
04:27:22.590 --> 04:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
program that incentivizes cleanups of
 
04:27:25.189 --> 04:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
these old sites by providing some
 
04:27:27.269 --> 04:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
liability protections for the folks who
 
04:27:29.910 --> 04:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
are taking on the
 
04:27:32.790 --> 04:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
projects the uh so we had the state
 
04:27:34.590 --> 04:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
sites programs and we also have the
 
04:27:36.710 --> 04:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
federal sites programs Federal sites
 
04:27:39.550 --> 04:27:39.560 align:start position:0%
come in in two types the super fund
 
04:27:41.910 --> 04:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
sites and the Department of Defense
 
04:27:41.920 --> 04:27:43.349 align:start position:0%
sites and the Department of Defense
sites

04:27:43.349 --> 04:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
sites
 
04:27:47.149 --> 04:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
the Superfund group is part of a state
 
04:27:49.510 --> 04:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
and federal partnership that helps to
 
04:27:52.349 --> 04:27:52.359 align:start position:0%
clean up super fund sites super fund
 
04:27:53.830 --> 04:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
sites fall into two groups there are
 
04:27:56.469 --> 04:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
ones that have a potentially responsible
 
04:27:58.950 --> 04:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
party leading the cleanup and there are
 
04:28:00.790 --> 04:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
ones where there's not a viable
 
04:28:02.790 --> 04:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
potentially responsible party and those
 
04:28:06.349 --> 04:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
are called fund Le sites the slide here
 
04:28:09.389 --> 04:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
summarizes those
 
04:28:12.349 --> 04:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
sites and then the department of a
 
04:28:15.670 --> 04:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
defense sites group uh IT addresses a
 
04:28:19.670 --> 04:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
range of sites everything from um
 
04:28:23.269 --> 04:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
formerly used defense sites like uh Old
 
04:28:25.309 --> 04:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
Musket drill yards dating back to the
 
04:28:28.550 --> 04:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
Revolutionary War on the all the way up
 
04:28:32.910 --> 04:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
to Major more modern complex remediation
 
04:28:35.870 --> 04:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
projects like the trees trade the peas
 
04:28:39.590 --> 04:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
trade Port where contamination from P
 
04:28:42.550 --> 04:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
from firefighting foam releases impacted
 
04:28:45.030 --> 04:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
two major public water supply
 
04:28:47.670 --> 04:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
walls they work very closely with
 
04:28:50.710 --> 04:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
branches of the Department of Defense uh
 
04:28:53.030 --> 04:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
like the Air Force and Army Corps to
 
04:28:55.750 --> 04:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
investigate and Remediation remediate
 
04:29:00.309 --> 04:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:02.189 --> 04:29:02.199 align:start position:0%
activities and now we'll move on to the
 
04:29:04.630 --> 04:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
mtbe remediation
 
04:29:07.670 --> 04:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
Bureau thank you Sarah so uh the MTB
 
04:29:10.189 --> 04:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
remediation Bureau is uh it's I guess
 
04:29:12.229 --> 04:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
it's coming on 10 years old now but it
 
04:29:14.269 --> 04:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
uh it's the newest of our bureaus it was
 
04:29:18.469 --> 04:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
created um as a result of the um
 
04:29:20.910 --> 04:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
lawsuits that were brought regarding uh
 
04:29:23.030 --> 04:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
the impacts of mtbe on groundwater and
 
04:29:24.990 --> 04:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
drinking water in the state and that
 
04:29:27.109 --> 04:29:27.119 align:start position:0%
Bureau is headed up by Matt Taylor who's
 
04:29:30.710 --> 04:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
here today um and it's staffed with
 
04:29:32.870 --> 04:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
engineers hydrogeologists and Grant and
 
04:29:35.550 --> 04:29:35.560 align:start position:0%
Loan Specialists um it's a really a
 
04:29:37.229 --> 04:29:37.239 align:start position:0%
bureau that we provide a tremendous
 
04:29:38.790 --> 04:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
amount of financial assistance and
 
04:29:41.309 --> 04:29:41.319 align:start position:0%
technical assistance to the communities
 
04:29:43.550 --> 04:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
um the MTB settlement fund was or the
 
04:29:46.149 --> 04:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
MTB case was really broken into two
 
04:29:48.670 --> 04:29:48.680 align:start position:0%
sections there was a settling parties
 
04:29:50.790 --> 04:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
the the state filed suit I think going
 
04:29:55.750 --> 04:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
back to like 2003 or four um against uh
 
04:29:57.910 --> 04:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
a number of uh manufacturers and
 
04:30:00.269 --> 04:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
Distributors of gasoline and all of
 
04:30:02.469 --> 04:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
those uh parties to the suit except for
 
04:30:04.590 --> 04:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
Exxon Mobile settled and there was about
 
04:30:06.750 --> 04:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
$80 million that was gained in that
 
04:30:08.990 --> 04:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
settlement and that forms the MTB
 
04:30:11.189 --> 04:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
settlement fund which has been used over
 
04:30:13.910 --> 04:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years for providing uh
 
04:30:16.990 --> 04:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
direct work at UH in communities where
 
04:30:19.309 --> 04:30:19.319 align:start position:0%
MTB contaminations had an outsized
 
04:30:21.389 --> 04:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
impact on drinking water quality we've
 
04:30:24.630 --> 04:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
used it to remove uh um underground
 
04:30:26.750 --> 04:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
tanks that that may still be posing a
 
04:30:28.389 --> 04:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
risk because of their age and still have
 
04:30:30.990 --> 04:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
MTV gasoline in them and also providing
 
04:30:32.830 --> 04:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
spill prevention at scrapyards that
 
04:30:36.149 --> 04:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
manage those uh those old vehicles um
 
04:30:38.389 --> 04:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
and then the the Exxon Mobile went to
 
04:30:40.710 --> 04:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
trial they were not a settling party and
 
04:30:42.510 --> 04:30:42.520 align:start position:0%
the state went to trial
 
04:30:47.070 --> 04:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
back in 2014 and got a verdict um that
 
04:30:49.389 --> 04:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
amounted to after everything was all
 
04:30:52.950 --> 04:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
sugared off uh approximately uh $300
 
04:30:56.750 --> 04:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
million or I think about $280 million
 
04:30:58.870 --> 04:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
that went to uh established the drinking
 
04:31:00.710 --> 04:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
water and groundwater trust fund which
 
04:31:03.670 --> 04:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
was created by the by the legislature uh
 
04:31:06.229 --> 04:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
for that purpose and it has a broader
 
04:31:07.870 --> 04:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
scope than just addressing MTB
 
04:31:10.790 --> 04:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
contamination it's been used over time
 
04:31:12.990 --> 04:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
under the direction of of a drinking
 
04:31:15.790 --> 04:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
water um and groundwater trust fund
 
04:31:18.309 --> 04:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
advisory commission to provide
 
04:31:20.950 --> 04:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
assistance to communities for improving
 
04:31:23.030 --> 04:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
drinking water systems and we'll we'll
 
04:31:24.950 --> 04:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about uh specifics of
 
04:31:27.030 --> 04:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
what that's done and then lastly we have
 
04:31:29.910 --> 04:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
a past response fund um which was also
 
04:31:31.389 --> 04:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
established by the legislature to
 
04:31:33.950 --> 04:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
provide loans grants and assistance to
 
04:31:36.070 --> 04:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
communities and and individuals who've
 
04:31:38.030 --> 04:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
been impacted by past
 
04:31:39.790 --> 04:31:39.800 align:start position:0%
contamination so if we go to the
 
04:31:42.070 --> 04:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
settlement fund uh important to know not
 
04:31:44.630 --> 04:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
that around 45% of the population in the
 
04:31:46.510 --> 04:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
state gets their water from a private
 
04:31:49.910 --> 04:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
drinking water well and um so we have
 
04:31:52.229 --> 04:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
very robust sampling program that we run
 
04:31:54.670 --> 04:31:54.680 align:start position:0%
out of the MTB remediation Bureau and
 
04:31:57.550 --> 04:31:57.560 align:start position:0%
we've uh sampled over 19,000 residential
 
04:31:59.790 --> 04:31:59.800 align:start position:0%
Wells since its Inception we do about
 
04:32:02.550 --> 04:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
2,000 per year that's turned out to be
 
04:32:04.269 --> 04:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
particularly helpful in the case of our
 
04:32:07.950 --> 04:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
pasas efforts um we also again as I
 
04:32:10.910 --> 04:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned do abandoned us removals spill
 
04:32:12.590 --> 04:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
prevention assistance
 
04:32:15.309 --> 04:32:15.319 align:start position:0%
and provide alternate water in mtbe
 
04:32:17.870 --> 04:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
impacted communities and that program
 
04:32:19.710 --> 04:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
has been responsible for projects that
 
04:32:22.309 --> 04:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
have installed more than 20 miles of new
 
04:32:25.590 --> 04:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
waterline U piping to provide safe clean
 
04:32:26.990 --> 04:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
drinking water to people who have been
 
04:32:29.109 --> 04:32:29.119 align:start position:0%
impacted by in communities who've been
 
04:32:30.830 --> 04:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
impacted by mtbe
 
04:32:32.630 --> 04:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
contamination the drinking water and
 
04:32:34.630 --> 04:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund again came from
 
04:32:36.910 --> 04:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
the Exxon Mobile portion of the of the
 
04:32:39.550 --> 04:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
of the lawsuit and that has been used to
 
04:32:42.389 --> 04:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
great effect since its Inception um to
 
04:32:44.630 --> 04:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
provide assistance for construction
 
04:32:47.229 --> 04:32:47.239 align:start position:0%
loans and grants to improve the
 
04:32:48.830 --> 04:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure of public drinking water
 
04:32:50.710 --> 04:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
in the state and and dozens of
 
04:32:53.229 --> 04:32:53.239 align:start position:0%
communities provides grants for
 
04:32:55.469 --> 04:32:55.479 align:start position:0%
protecting Source waters for for Public
 
04:32:58.109 --> 04:32:58.119 align:start position:0%
Water Systems uh it's also partnered we
 
04:32:59.469 --> 04:32:59.479 align:start position:0%
partnered with the Water Division to
 
04:33:01.830 --> 04:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
provide assistance for lead Remediation
 
04:33:04.349 --> 04:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
in schools grants for schools to cover
 
04:33:06.109 --> 04:33:06.119 align:start position:0%
100% of the cost to remove their lead
 
04:33:09.109 --> 04:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
fixtures um and outlets and then also
 
04:33:12.310 --> 04:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
some grants for uh Prov for the
 
04:33:14.310 --> 04:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
that Public Water Systems might want to
 
04:33:17.109 --> 04:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
study whether a small public water
 
04:33:18.629 --> 04:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
system wants to combine with another
 
04:33:20.551 --> 04:33:20.561 align:start position:0%
public water system and that might
 
04:33:22.551 --> 04:33:22.561 align:start position:0%
actually be more cost effective and long
 
04:33:25.269 --> 04:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
be a better long-term plan than making
 
04:33:27.029 --> 04:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
specific Capital Improvements to their
 
04:33:29.390 --> 04:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
particular water system and then we also
 
04:33:31.189 --> 04:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
have a private well initiative which I
 
04:33:32.869 --> 04:33:32.879 align:start position:0%
mentioned where we do sample a lot of
 
04:33:34.390 --> 04:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
wells for for
 
04:33:38.470 --> 04:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
pasas um the MTB remediation Bureau um
 
04:33:41.750 --> 04:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
past response fund essentially uh provid
 
04:33:44.310 --> 04:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
Ides uh assistance for loans and grants
 
04:33:47.109 --> 04:33:47.119 align:start position:0%
to communities to address past
 
04:33:50.429 --> 04:33:50.439 align:start position:0%
contamination in drinking water um and
 
04:33:53.269 --> 04:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
also uh operates a very robust pfast
 
04:33:56.029 --> 04:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
rebate program where we provided over
 
04:33:59.230 --> 04:33:59.240 align:start position:0%
4,400 rebates to Residents totaling over
 
04:34:02.910 --> 04:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
$6 million to put treatment on their
 
04:34:05.470 --> 04:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
individual private Wells to address past
 
04:34:07.390 --> 04:34:07.400 align:start position:0%
contamination or if they're fortunate
 
04:34:09.470 --> 04:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
enough to be located near a public water
 
04:34:11.390 --> 04:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
system to connect to the local public
 
04:34:14.349 --> 04:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
water system and that um basically
 
04:34:17.390 --> 04:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
program provides up to $5,000 to offset
 
04:34:19.269 --> 04:34:19.279 align:start position:0%
the cost of putting a treatment system
 
04:34:22.310 --> 04:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
in your home or up to $10,000 to offset
 
04:34:24.869 --> 04:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
the cost of connection connecting to a
 
04:34:27.709 --> 04:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
public water system and then uh funds
 
04:34:29.590 --> 04:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
from that fund have also been used to
 
04:34:33.230 --> 04:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
support a very successful um aquous
 
04:34:35.830 --> 04:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
Fighter fighting foam takeback program
 
04:34:38.470 --> 04:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
that we ran this past year where we
 
04:34:41.709 --> 04:34:41.719 align:start position:0%
collected over 11,000 gallons of legacy
 
04:34:43.429 --> 04:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
firefighting Foams that contain high
 
04:34:46.230 --> 04:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
levels of pasas from our Municipal and
 
04:34:48.629 --> 04:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
local fire departments and we um
 
04:34:50.429 --> 04:34:50.439 align:start position:0%
collected that material and trucked it
 
04:34:52.990 --> 04:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
off to a facility in Ohio that over the
 
04:34:54.310 --> 04:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
course of the next several months will
 
04:34:58.830 --> 04:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
be treating that to destroy the pasas
 
04:35:01.789 --> 04:35:01.799 align:start position:0%
Foams so that uh describes uh in a
 
04:35:03.750 --> 04:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
nutshell sort of what's been going on in
 
04:35:06.949 --> 04:35:06.959 align:start position:0%
our MTB remediation Bureau um next I
 
04:35:08.590 --> 04:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
want to talk about our Solid Waste
 
04:35:10.670 --> 04:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
Management Bureau and that's headed up
 
04:35:13.029 --> 04:35:13.039 align:start position:0%
by leam McKenna who our administrator
 
04:35:16.390 --> 04:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
and Le is here today um again that's
 
04:35:18.390 --> 04:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
staffed with engineers and environmental
 
04:35:21.869 --> 04:35:21.879 align:start position:0%
scientists and planners and we cover um
 
04:35:24.070 --> 04:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
a variety of of activities related to
 
04:35:26.349 --> 04:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
managing Solid Waste safely that
 
04:35:28.070 --> 04:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
includes an engineering and permitting
 
04:35:30.470 --> 04:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
section which reviews applications for
 
04:35:32.590 --> 04:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
new facility permits and modifications
 
04:35:35.070 --> 04:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
to those permits and reviews reports
 
04:35:37.189 --> 04:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
submitted by both closed and active
 
04:35:39.269 --> 04:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
landfills uh they provide technical
 
04:35:41.470 --> 04:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
assistance to applicants and permites
 
04:35:43.551 --> 04:35:43.561 align:start position:0%
and and enforce the terms of the permits
 
04:35:46.551 --> 04:35:46.561 align:start position:0%
that are issued we have a compliance
 
04:35:48.709 --> 04:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
Assurance section which inspects
 
04:35:51.990 --> 04:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
facilities and reviews um most of the
 
04:35:55.349 --> 04:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
non- landfill related uh facility
 
04:35:57.789 --> 04:35:57.799 align:start position:0%
reports and they engage in compliance
 
04:36:00.310 --> 04:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement activities to make sure that
 
04:36:02.349 --> 04:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
the rules are being complied with and
 
04:36:04.470 --> 04:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
also they head up our rul making
 
04:36:06.590 --> 04:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
activities and then there's a reporting
 
04:36:08.349 --> 04:36:08.359 align:start position:0%
information and financial management
 
04:36:10.709 --> 04:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
section which is responsible for the
 
04:36:13.109 --> 04:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
intake and process processing of almost
 
04:36:14.830 --> 04:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
all of the documentation that comes into
 
04:36:17.150 --> 04:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
the bureau uh they manage our financial
 
04:36:19.789 --> 04:36:19.799 align:start position:0%
assurance and grants Management Programs
 
04:36:21.709 --> 04:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
uh for closed landfills and
 
04:36:23.750 --> 04:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
incinerators and then lastly we have a
 
04:36:25.830 --> 04:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
materials management and education and
 
04:36:28.470 --> 04:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
planning section and that section trains
 
04:36:31.429 --> 04:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
and certifies over, 1600 operators
 
04:36:33.510 --> 04:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
working at Solid Waste facilities in New
 
04:36:35.789 --> 04:36:35.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we provide Outreach to
 
04:36:37.510 --> 04:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities looking for information
 
04:36:39.830 --> 04:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
about waste diversion and they also
 
04:36:41.709 --> 04:36:41.719 align:start position:0%
responsible for drafting Solid Waste
 
04:36:43.349 --> 04:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
management plans and reports that are
 
04:36:46.310 --> 04:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
required uh by by Statute for us to
 
04:36:48.590 --> 04:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
produce um they'll also be working this
 
04:36:51.029 --> 04:36:51.039 align:start position:0%
year on rules to create a program to
 
04:36:53.109 --> 04:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
carry out the food waste disposal ban
 
04:36:54.789 --> 04:36:54.799 align:start position:0%
that was implemented by the legislature
 
04:36:54.799 --> 04:36:55.590 align:start position:0%
that was implemented by the legislature
last

04:36:55.590 --> 04:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
last
 
04:36:57.789 --> 04:36:57.799 align:start position:0%
year so there's a slide there that kind
 
04:36:59.949 --> 04:36:59.959 align:start position:0%
of describes Solid Waste suffice to say
 
04:37:01.189 --> 04:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
pretty much anything that isn't a
 
04:37:03.510 --> 04:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste is a solid waste with
 
04:37:05.830 --> 04:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
the exception of uh things like yard
 
04:37:09.429 --> 04:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
waste or um waste or wastewater
 
04:37:11.551 --> 04:37:11.561 align:start position:0%
treatment sludge which is largely
 
04:37:15.150 --> 04:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:18.990 --> 04:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
Division the we regulate approximately
 
04:37:21.910 --> 04:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
200 uh operating facilities um those
 
04:37:23.830 --> 04:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
include transfer stations and recycling
 
04:37:26.150 --> 04:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
centers and processing and treatment
 
04:37:28.029 --> 04:37:28.039 align:start position:0%
facilities which could include a waste
 
04:37:30.750 --> 04:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
of energy facility or compost a food
 
04:37:33.910 --> 04:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
composting facility we also regulate um
 
04:37:35.949 --> 04:37:35.959 align:start position:0%
landfills that take Municipal Solid
 
04:37:38.830 --> 04:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
Waste bulky waste Ash and construction
 
04:37:41.910 --> 04:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
and demolition debris and um we have
 
04:37:44.789 --> 04:37:44.799 align:start position:0%
about 150 auto recycling centers that we
 
04:37:47.750 --> 04:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
regulate and then we have a legacy of
 
04:37:51.189 --> 04:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
about 300 primarily unlined inactive
 
04:37:53.310 --> 04:37:53.320 align:start position:0%
closed landfills that were largely owned
 
04:37:55.029 --> 04:37:55.039 align:start position:0%
by municipalities that were owned and
 
04:37:57.789 --> 04:37:57.799 align:start position:0%
operated during the uh early part of the
 
04:37:59.429 --> 04:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
1900s all the way through to about the
 
04:38:02.709 --> 04:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
early 1980s before we moved primarily to
 
04:38:05.150 --> 04:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
lined facilities for management of
 
04:38:09.390 --> 04:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
waste um so we have uh nine operating
 
04:38:11.590 --> 04:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
landfills currently and three of them
 
04:38:13.670 --> 04:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
are specific to certain waste types and
 
04:38:17.390 --> 04:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
six are for MSW facilities um the
 
04:38:19.230 --> 04:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
specific waste types include the eping
 
04:38:22.029 --> 04:38:22.039 align:start position:0%
bulky waste facility the cornhill road
 
04:38:23.869 --> 04:38:23.879 align:start position:0%
facility in bosin which takes cndd
 
04:38:26.830 --> 04:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
debris and the marac coash landfill at
 
04:38:28.990 --> 04:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
the uh power
 
04:38:31.869 --> 04:38:31.879 align:start position:0%
station so we administer this program
 
04:38:33.429 --> 04:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
through a series of permits so any of
 
04:38:35.629 --> 04:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
these facilities requires a permit so
 
04:38:38.269 --> 04:38:38.279 align:start position:0%
that is a the primary function of our um
 
04:38:40.029 --> 04:38:40.039 align:start position:0%
engineering and permitting
 
04:38:42.470 --> 04:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
section so with with that I want to go
 
04:38:45.269 --> 04:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
to uh our last Bureau that we're going
 
04:38:46.910 --> 04:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
to talk about and that's our hazardous
 
04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
waste management Bureau and that's
 
04:38:51.349 --> 04:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
headed up by Todd pescovitz who's also
 
04:38:53.750 --> 04:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
here with us today um and that is
 
04:38:55.390 --> 04:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
staffed with chemists environmental
 
04:38:58.109 --> 04:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
scientists and Engineers um who are
 
04:39:00.109 --> 04:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
responsible for implementing um the
 
04:39:02.789 --> 04:39:02.799 align:start position:0%
federal resource conservation Recovery
 
04:39:05.070 --> 04:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
Act or what we call recro for short and
 
04:39:07.869 --> 04:39:07.879 align:start position:0%
that was the law that was passed in 1980
 
04:39:11.429 --> 04:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
to estab excuse me 1976 to establish a
 
04:39:14.390 --> 04:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
cradle degrade management system for
 
04:39:17.070 --> 04:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
managing hazard waste in the state and
 
04:39:19.949 --> 04:39:19.959 align:start position:0%
we provide uh we've been authorized to
 
04:39:21.830 --> 04:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
implement that for many years and we do
 
04:39:23.390 --> 04:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of work to maintain that
 
04:39:25.709 --> 04:39:25.719 align:start position:0%
authorization that authorization means
 
04:39:27.629 --> 04:39:27.639 align:start position:0%
that once you have an authorized program
 
04:39:29.189 --> 04:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
that's been approved by EPA and the
 
04:39:29.199 --> 04:39:30.390 align:start position:0%
that's been approved by EPA and the
Ricker

04:39:30.390 --> 04:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
Ricker
 
04:39:32.789 --> 04:39:32.799 align:start position:0%
program the state rules become the law
 
04:39:34.349 --> 04:39:34.359 align:start position:0%
of the land and the federal rules cease
 
04:39:36.990 --> 04:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
to exist so it's very important that we
 
04:39:38.708 --> 04:39:38.718 align:start position:0%
maintain that authorization and maintain
 
04:39:41.390 --> 04:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
a robust program because the state laws
 
04:39:42.750 --> 04:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
the law of the land in New Hampshire
 
04:39:45.110 --> 04:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
when it comes to management of hazardous
 
04:39:48.628 --> 04:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
waste um The Bureau is responsible for
 
04:39:50.830 --> 04:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
implementing the program and the state
 
04:39:53.948 --> 04:39:53.958 align:start position:0%
receives a grant um funds to that help
 
04:39:56.948 --> 04:39:56.958 align:start position:0%
to support that work um it consists of
 
04:39:59.948 --> 04:39:59.958 align:start position:0%
various sections that oversee compliance
 
04:40:02.190 --> 04:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
technical support managing and tracking
 
04:40:04.550 --> 04:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
of data and Technical Support to the
 
04:40:06.310 --> 04:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
regulated community so we'll talk a
 
04:40:07.830 --> 04:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
little bit about each one of those
 
04:40:10.670 --> 04:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
sections so our authorization section as
 
04:40:11.990 --> 04:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
I said it's very important that we
 
04:40:15.070 --> 04:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
maintain our authorization and um we do
 
04:40:16.868 --> 04:40:16.878 align:start position:0%
we really kind of work full-time on that
 
04:40:18.590 --> 04:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
because the federal government is
 
04:40:20.910 --> 04:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
constantly amending and changing those
 
04:40:23.110 --> 04:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
rules and we need to pay attention to
 
04:40:25.230 --> 04:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
that and adopt those changes as they
 
04:40:28.990 --> 04:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
become effective at the federal level um
 
04:40:32.350 --> 04:40:32.360 align:start position:0%
so that's really a constant work product
 
04:40:33.948 --> 04:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
that we have to keep working on and
 
04:40:36.110 --> 04:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
we're always working on on rulemaking
 
04:40:37.750 --> 04:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
and maintaining our authorization under
 
04:40:40.590 --> 04:40:40.600 align:start position:0%
the program uh the hazard space Bureau
 
04:40:43.350 --> 04:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
also has a technical assistance section
 
04:40:45.110 --> 04:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
and that includes some very important
 
04:40:47.750 --> 04:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
work that is involves training um and
 
04:40:50.708 --> 04:40:50.718 align:start position:0%
self-certification so for generators of
 
04:40:53.590 --> 04:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
waste of more than 220 pounds per month
 
04:40:54.910 --> 04:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
what we would call a full quantity
 
04:40:57.390 --> 04:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
generator they're required to have on
 
04:41:00.550 --> 04:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
staff a h a trained certified Hazard was
 
04:41:02.190 --> 04:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
coordinator that has gone through a
 
04:41:04.190 --> 04:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
training and certific certification
 
04:41:05.868 --> 04:41:05.878 align:start position:0%
program that's administered by the
 
04:41:08.750 --> 04:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
department and so we spend we have staff
 
04:41:10.150 --> 04:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
that are dedicated to providing that
 
04:41:12.110 --> 04:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
training on an ongoing basis they have a
 
04:41:14.150 --> 04:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
basic training and then a variety of
 
04:41:16.230 --> 04:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
more advanced modules to help keep those
 
04:41:19.628 --> 04:41:19.638 align:start position:0%
folks really U trained in an expert
 
04:41:21.990 --> 04:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
level to safely manage hazardous waste
 
04:41:25.628 --> 04:41:25.638 align:start position:0%
at their companies and then um we have a
 
04:41:28.070 --> 04:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh small quantity gener compliance
 
04:41:30.868 --> 04:41:30.878 align:start position:0%
certification program there are far more
 
04:41:32.430 --> 04:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
small quantity generators than large
 
04:41:34.788 --> 04:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
quantity generators it would be very
 
04:41:36.310 --> 04:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to train all of those
 
04:41:39.150 --> 04:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
people or to to inspect them with any
 
04:41:41.230 --> 04:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
great regularity so what we developed
 
04:41:43.230 --> 04:41:43.240 align:start position:0%
veloped a number of years ago is a
 
04:41:45.030 --> 04:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
certification program where they
 
04:41:46.990 --> 04:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
basically are required to do a self-
 
04:41:49.788 --> 04:41:49.798 align:start position:0%
audit every 3 years self- certify their
 
04:41:52.670 --> 04:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
compliance and report that to the agency
 
04:41:54.510 --> 04:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
we review those reports and then if
 
04:41:56.830 --> 04:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
there's anything that raises a flag we
 
04:41:58.708 --> 04:41:58.718 align:start position:0%
use that to identify where we might go
 
04:42:00.910 --> 04:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
and conduct uh focused and targeted
 
04:42:03.310 --> 04:42:03.320 align:start position:0%
inspections and that's proved to really
 
04:42:05.788 --> 04:42:05.798 align:start position:0%
significantly improve the compliance of
 
04:42:07.868 --> 04:42:07.878 align:start position:0%
our small quantity generators and I
 
04:42:09.750 --> 04:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
would note I I began my career working
 
04:42:12.110 --> 04:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
in that in that Bureau and one of the
 
04:42:13.430 --> 04:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
things that became very evident to me
 
04:42:15.750 --> 04:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
quickly is that in fact many of the
 
04:42:17.708 --> 04:42:17.718 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste sites that created
 
04:42:20.270 --> 04:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
significant groundwater problems and POS
 
04:42:22.230 --> 04:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
significant risk to communities were
 
04:42:23.590 --> 04:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
actually created by small quantity
 
04:42:24.948 --> 04:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
generators who had mismanaged their
 
04:42:26.270 --> 04:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
waste you might think it would be the
 
04:42:28.390 --> 04:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
larger generators that that would
 
04:42:30.350 --> 04:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
predominantly cause those problems and
 
04:42:32.390 --> 04:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
they and they certainly did their share
 
04:42:34.750 --> 04:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
but in many cases those facilities are
 
04:42:36.750 --> 04:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
are better staffed and better resourced
 
04:42:38.310 --> 04:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
and they were able to manage their way
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
safely and in many cases the small
 
04:42:41.990 --> 04:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
quantity General ators were smaller
 
04:42:43.430 --> 04:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
businesses that didn't really have a lot
 
04:42:45.628 --> 04:42:45.638 align:start position:0%
of resources to put to it weren't always
 
04:42:48.670 --> 04:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
all that well educated about how to um
 
04:42:51.070 --> 04:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
manage waste properly and so this small
 
04:42:53.030 --> 04:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
quantity generator self-certification
 
04:42:55.750 --> 04:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
program has really helped them to get
 
04:42:59.070 --> 04:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
very cost effectively and efficiently to
 
04:43:00.190 --> 04:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
understand what does they need to do to
 
04:43:01.550 --> 04:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
manage their waste safely and it's
 
04:43:03.190 --> 04:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
really made huge improvements in
 
04:43:06.030 --> 04:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
prevention of of waste sites we also
 
04:43:08.070 --> 04:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
have a technical assistance section
 
04:43:09.910 --> 04:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
which provides household hazardous waste
 
04:43:12.550 --> 04:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
grants to IP alties to collect household
 
04:43:14.948 --> 04:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
waste and also a pollution prevention
 
04:43:17.550 --> 04:43:17.560 align:start position:0%
program which provides free confidential
 
04:43:19.910 --> 04:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
technical assistance and compliance
 
04:43:22.628 --> 04:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
assistance um to any companies who ask
 
04:43:24.750 --> 04:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
for it and helps them reduce their waste
 
04:43:27.830 --> 04:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
and use less toxic products and then we
 
04:43:29.628 --> 04:43:29.638 align:start position:0%
have a permitting section we do have a
 
04:43:31.670 --> 04:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
number of facilities that we don't have
 
04:43:34.110 --> 04:43:34.120 align:start position:0%
any um permited treatment storage or
 
04:43:35.628 --> 04:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
disposal facilities that operate
 
04:43:37.670 --> 04:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
commercially in the state um all the
 
04:43:39.230 --> 04:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
waste that's generated here that has to
 
04:43:41.070 --> 04:43:41.080 align:start position:0%
go to a licensed facility is actually
 
04:43:43.310 --> 04:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
shipped out of state um but we do have a
 
04:43:44.910 --> 04:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
number of manufacturing facilities that
 
04:43:46.990 --> 04:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
may generate hazardous wastewaters that
 
04:43:49.190 --> 04:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
are subject to regulation and in many
 
04:43:51.030 --> 04:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
cases they treat those wastewaters on
 
04:43:53.628 --> 04:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
site to um to render them non-hazardous
 
04:43:55.788 --> 04:43:55.798 align:start position:0%
and and appropriate for disposal in the
 
04:43:58.310 --> 04:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
local sewage systems and we permit those
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
with limited permits to make sure that
 
04:44:02.230 --> 04:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
those treatment systems being permit are
 
04:44:05.350 --> 04:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
being operated correctly and
 
04:44:08.270 --> 04:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
safely and then the compliance section
 
04:44:10.350 --> 04:44:10.360 align:start position:0%
um is where you know we really kind of
 
04:44:12.030 --> 04:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
rubber meets the to make sure that folks
 
04:44:14.190 --> 04:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
are complying we have an inspection
 
04:44:17.190 --> 04:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
program that um inspects facilities we
 
04:44:20.350 --> 04:44:20.360 align:start position:0%
in the in FY 2023 plan was you know we
 
04:44:22.628 --> 04:44:22.638 align:start position:0%
inspected 16 large quantity generators
 
04:44:26.708 --> 04:44:26.718 align:start position:0%
and 16 others um and then also to the
 
04:44:28.990 --> 04:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
extent we get citizen complaints that
 
04:44:31.310 --> 04:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
may spawn an additional inspection at
 
04:44:33.270 --> 04:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
another facility and then we have an
 
04:44:35.510 --> 04:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement program that um ensures fair
 
04:44:37.150 --> 04:44:37.160 align:start position:0%
and consistent application of those
 
04:44:39.948 --> 04:44:39.958 align:start position:0%
rules and a US program that Focus
 
04:44:42.150 --> 04:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
specifically on how used oils are
 
04:44:43.590 --> 04:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
managed in the
 
04:44:45.830 --> 04:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
state and the facts are that we have
 
04:44:47.550 --> 04:44:47.560 align:start position:0%
about 10 a. half million pounds of waste
 
04:44:49.948 --> 04:44:49.958 align:start position:0%
generated in the state and over 20
 
04:44:52.910 --> 04:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
almost 2200 regulated facilities and
 
04:44:55.110 --> 04:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
about almost 300 of those are those
 
04:44:56.590 --> 04:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
larger quantity facilities that I
 
04:44:59.070 --> 04:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned but 1,00 of them are those
 
04:45:00.510 --> 04:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
small quantity generators that are
 
04:45:03.190 --> 04:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
subject to self-certification and with
 
04:45:05.708 --> 04:45:05.718 align:start position:0%
that we've taken a whirlwind tour of uh
 
04:45:08.070 --> 04:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
of our division and uh I I don't know
 
04:45:09.470 --> 04:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
how you want it we could take questions
 
04:45:11.230 --> 04:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
now or I could turn it over to Amy to
 
04:45:13.390 --> 04:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
present on the invasive species and then
 
04:45:15.190 --> 04:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
we can come back and field questions for
 
04:45:17.230 --> 04:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
as long as you'd
 
04:45:19.788 --> 04:45:19.798 align:start position:0%
like let's have Amy come up and then
 
04:45:21.830 --> 04:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
afterwards we'll have
 
04:45:24.350 --> 04:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh have questions for the entire
 
04:45:26.070 --> 04:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
department terrific thank you thank you
 
04:45:26.080 --> 04:45:32.670 align:start position:0%
department terrific thank you thank you
so

04:45:32.670 --> 04:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:35.150 --> 04:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
much thank you madam chair and committee
 
04:45:37.910 --> 04:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
members my name is Amy smagula and I'm a
 
04:45:39.430 --> 04:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
chief aquatic biologist at the
 
04:45:42.110 --> 04:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services is
 
04:45:45.830 --> 04:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
I I also uh direct our lony Center which
 
04:45:48.628 --> 04:45:48.638 align:start position:0%
is where we look at lakes ponds rivers
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
in the state so we're going to take a
 
04:45:53.868 --> 04:45:53.878 align:start position:0%
quick dive into water for a few minutes
 
04:45:56.110 --> 04:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
while I update you on the invasive
 
04:46:00.868 --> 04:46:00.878 align:start position:0%
species program so we focus mostly on
 
04:46:02.270 --> 04:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
aquatic invasive plants at the
 
04:46:04.150 --> 04:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services but
 
04:46:06.830 --> 04:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
we also do work with aquatic invasive
 
04:46:09.628 --> 04:46:09.638 align:start position:0%
animals because they are out there and I
 
04:46:10.910 --> 04:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
just wanted to give you an in
 
04:46:13.190 --> 04:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
introduction and overview of the issue
 
04:46:15.150 --> 04:46:15.160 align:start position:0%
and sort of a state of the state for
 
04:46:16.708 --> 04:46:16.718 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing across New Hampshire
 
04:46:19.230 --> 04:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
today and how we as an agency and as a
 
04:46:21.590 --> 04:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
state have been dealing with aquatic
 
04:46:24.510 --> 04:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
invasive species for the last number of
 
04:46:26.628 --> 04:46:26.638 align:start position:0%
years uh I'm very familiar with the
 
04:46:29.390 --> 04:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
program I coordinated it for 26 years
 
04:46:30.868 --> 04:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
before switching into my current
 
04:46:33.350 --> 04:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
position so I've seen a lot of different
 
04:46:36.510 --> 04:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
issues that have Arisen across the state
 
04:46:38.948 --> 04:46:38.958 align:start position:0%
and the definition for an invasive
 
04:46:41.390 --> 04:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
species federally dates back back to
 
04:46:43.910 --> 04:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
1999 and it includes a species that's
 
04:46:46.190 --> 04:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
not native to a particular area so it
 
04:46:48.548 --> 04:46:48.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't really belong here and the real
 
04:46:50.830 --> 04:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
concern is that these things come into
 
04:46:52.948 --> 04:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
our state our Lakes our rivers and they
 
04:46:54.990 --> 04:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
cause economic and environmental harm
 
04:46:57.150 --> 04:46:57.160 align:start position:0%
and harm to human health and those are
 
04:46:59.628 --> 04:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we are concerned about
 
04:47:02.150 --> 04:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
those they have a lot of characteristics
 
04:47:04.548 --> 04:47:04.558 align:start position:0%
that cause them to spread quickly uh
 
04:47:06.628 --> 04:47:06.638 align:start position:0%
jump between water bodies and they lack
 
04:47:08.948 --> 04:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
natural predators and they have a lot of
 
04:47:11.470 --> 04:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
impacts on our natural resources they
 
04:47:14.030 --> 04:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
can uh threaten native species including
 
04:47:16.190 --> 04:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
rare threatened and endangered species
 
04:47:18.350 --> 04:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
that we have in our state they are the
 
04:47:20.310 --> 04:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
second leading cause of loss of
 
04:47:22.230 --> 04:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
biodiversity in our
 
04:47:24.670 --> 04:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
environment they can change water
 
04:47:26.670 --> 04:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
chemistry and water quality they can
 
04:47:29.470 --> 04:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
make our water warmer by holding heat
 
04:47:31.628 --> 04:47:31.638 align:start position:0%
and affecting our fisheries and overall
 
04:47:34.310 --> 04:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
health of our systems they certainly
 
04:47:36.868 --> 04:47:36.878 align:start position:0%
hinder recreation in our state and
 
04:47:40.350 --> 04:47:40.360 align:start position:0%
impact swimming and boating and fishing
 
04:47:43.110 --> 04:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
is also impacted um even though people
 
04:47:44.390 --> 04:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
go after the weed beds when they're
 
04:47:46.948 --> 04:47:46.958 align:start position:0%
fishing a little too much is not often
 
04:47:49.910 --> 04:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
good uh also a lot of these uh
 
04:47:52.350 --> 04:47:52.360 align:start position:0%
management issues lead to millions of
 
04:47:54.350 --> 04:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
dollars of management costs in New
 
04:47:56.708 --> 04:47:56.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and economic studies out of
 
04:47:58.230 --> 04:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire have
 
04:48:00.750 --> 04:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
shown that aquatic invasive species can
 
04:48:03.510 --> 04:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
reduce property values on lakes and
 
04:48:06.868 --> 04:48:06.878 align:start position:0%
rivers by as much as 10 to 16% so that
 
04:48:09.310 --> 04:48:09.320 align:start position:0%
can be a significant
 
04:48:12.430 --> 04:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
impact as for the State of the State we
 
04:48:15.190 --> 04:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
have uh over about a thousand lakes and
 
04:48:16.628 --> 04:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
ponds and about
 
04:48:19.708 --> 04:48:19.718 align:start position:0%
16,000 um miles of rivers and 11,000
 
04:48:21.430 --> 04:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
miles of rivers and streams across the
 
04:48:24.070 --> 04:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
state and this map shows you the
 
04:48:26.750 --> 04:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
distribution of aquatic invasive species
 
04:48:28.948 --> 04:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
growth and I for some reason did not
 
04:48:31.430 --> 04:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
forget the top half of this map uh there
 
04:48:33.110 --> 04:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
are just no invasives that we've
 
04:48:34.948 --> 04:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
documented in the northern part of our
 
04:48:37.788 --> 04:48:37.798 align:start position:0%
state most of them are isolated to the
 
04:48:41.990 --> 04:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
southern half and that is is mostly
 
04:48:43.470 --> 04:48:43.480 align:start position:0%
aquatic invasive plants that you're
 
04:48:46.628 --> 04:48:46.638 align:start position:0%
seeing there 97 of those water bodies
 
04:48:48.230 --> 04:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned the count of are
 
04:48:51.510 --> 04:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
infested 11 river systems and 86 leaks
 
04:48:54.548 --> 04:48:54.558 align:start position:0%
and ponds in fact most of you represent
 
04:48:57.150 --> 04:48:57.160 align:start position:0%
a district or are near a district that
 
04:48:59.190 --> 04:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
have some type of invasive species
 
04:49:01.670 --> 04:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
growth so it is definitely far-reaching
 
04:49:06.070 --> 04:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
and we have a total of 133 infestations
 
04:49:07.628 --> 04:49:07.638 align:start position:0%
what that means is some water bodies
 
04:49:10.070 --> 04:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
have more than one thing the Nasha River
 
04:49:12.110 --> 04:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
in nashwa has has six different invasive
 
04:49:14.190 --> 04:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
species so doesn't the Connecticut River
 
04:49:16.670 --> 04:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
in multiple Parts uh many of our Lakes
 
04:49:18.270 --> 04:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
have a few different things including
 
04:49:20.430 --> 04:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
our state's largest lake lake winaki
 
04:49:23.030 --> 04:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
with three different invasive species so
 
04:49:25.350 --> 04:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
it is it is a very felt problem across
 
04:49:28.270 --> 04:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
the state and I just wanted to because
 
04:49:31.030 --> 04:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
photos show a lot this was water
 
04:49:33.708 --> 04:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
chestnut on the nashal river this was
 
04:49:35.670 --> 04:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
about an 8 acre patch we've since
 
04:49:37.390 --> 04:49:37.400 align:start position:0%
remediated it so it doesn't look like
 
04:49:38.788 --> 04:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
this anymore but this was pretty
 
04:49:41.868 --> 04:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
devastating to the nashille river
 
04:49:43.948 --> 04:49:43.958 align:start position:0%
uh this is the pem jaset river in
 
04:49:46.350 --> 04:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
Bristol and that is all variable mil
 
04:49:48.190 --> 04:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
foil choking a stretch of the river
 
04:49:50.190 --> 04:49:50.200 align:start position:0%
system near the boat
 
04:49:54.350 --> 04:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
launch that is uh Le pond in molten Boro
 
04:49:55.868 --> 04:49:55.878 align:start position:0%
with variable mil
 
04:49:58.590 --> 04:49:58.600 align:start position:0%
foil that's fan wart from Robinson Pond
 
04:50:01.070 --> 04:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
and Hudson with dense
 
04:50:03.548 --> 04:50:03.558 align:start position:0%
growth and this is a new invasive
 
04:50:05.110 --> 04:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
species that we have up in Lake wiip
 
04:50:07.990 --> 04:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
pasak that I documented in 2020 it is
 
04:50:10.230 --> 04:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
the only public water body across the
 
04:50:12.910 --> 04:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
country that has this plant and we had
 
04:50:14.788 --> 04:50:14.798 align:start position:0%
to do a lot of research to figure it out
 
04:50:17.150 --> 04:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
and it is spreading wild uh widely in
 
04:50:19.628 --> 04:50:19.638 align:start position:0%
Lake winaki at this point and of course
 
04:50:21.628 --> 04:50:21.638 align:start position:0%
that's posing a threat to opii
 
04:50:25.708 --> 04:50:25.718 align:start position:0%
winnisquam the wabaki river the pemi the
 
04:50:27.510 --> 04:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
miramac river all the way through the
 
04:50:30.590 --> 04:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
system so you can see how flow through
 
04:50:33.190 --> 04:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
is significant it moves with
 
04:50:35.868 --> 04:50:35.878 align:start position:0%
water and then of course we have animals
 
04:50:38.670 --> 04:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire has uh several aquatic
 
04:50:40.708 --> 04:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
invasive animals that we watch these
 
04:50:42.230 --> 04:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
actually fall under the jurisdiction of
 
04:50:44.190 --> 04:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
the fishing game department but we keep
 
04:50:45.910 --> 04:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
eyes on them because we are out on these
 
04:50:48.708 --> 04:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
water bodies looking for them the top
 
04:50:51.030 --> 04:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
left spiny water flea was recently
 
04:50:53.990 --> 04:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
documented in Lake winaki two years ago
 
04:50:55.750 --> 04:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
and we've already seen some significant
 
04:50:58.310 --> 04:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
changes to the health of Winnie because
 
04:51:02.150 --> 04:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
of that that organism in the leak and uh
 
04:51:04.270 --> 04:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
a couple of the others the Chinese
 
04:51:06.470 --> 04:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
mystery snail and Asian clam we don't
 
04:51:08.230 --> 04:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
have we do have in New Hampshire the
 
04:51:10.990 --> 04:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
zebra muscle we don't yet uh the Asian
 
04:51:14.030 --> 04:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
clam is in several water bodies from bow
 
04:51:16.670 --> 04:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
South through the southern border and
 
04:51:18.990 --> 04:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
then Chinese mystery snail is in dozens
 
04:51:21.990 --> 04:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
of water bodies causing impacts to food
 
04:51:25.230 --> 04:51:25.240 align:start position:0%
webs and um Aesthetics
 
04:51:28.510 --> 04:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
mainly so what we do and this is sort of
 
04:51:31.310 --> 04:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
a Continuum or a progression I guess
 
04:51:33.868 --> 04:51:33.878 align:start position:0%
more we try our best to prevent new
 
04:51:36.350 --> 04:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
infestations as much as possible and
 
04:51:38.590 --> 04:51:38.600 align:start position:0%
this is most cost effective we do a lot
 
04:51:41.390 --> 04:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
of Outreach and education signage
 
04:51:43.830 --> 04:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
we have laws and rules that prohibit the
 
04:51:46.310 --> 04:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
sale transport introduction of aquatic
 
04:51:48.910 --> 04:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
invasive species so that we can prevent
 
04:51:50.430 --> 04:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
them from coming to New Hampshire and
 
04:51:52.110 --> 04:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
spreading within New Hampshire when they
 
04:51:54.708 --> 04:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
get here we also focus a lot on early
 
04:51:56.750 --> 04:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
detection we have volunteer networks
 
04:51:58.190 --> 04:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
that do monitoring we also have
 
04:52:00.548 --> 04:52:00.558 align:start position:0%
biologists that go out and do surveys
 
04:52:02.788 --> 04:52:02.798 align:start position:0%
and we try to find species early before
 
04:52:04.390 --> 04:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
they spread quickly so that we can
 
04:52:07.510 --> 04:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
manage them effectively and hope for
 
04:52:10.190 --> 04:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
eradication rapid response is something
 
04:52:11.910 --> 04:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
that we do when we find something it's
 
04:52:13.750 --> 04:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
that quick response to get out there and
 
04:52:16.510 --> 04:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
and remove it as quickly as possible and
 
04:52:19.270 --> 04:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
then if we don't get ahead of it or an
 
04:52:22.230 --> 04:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
infestation is Advanced before we get to
 
04:52:25.270 --> 04:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
it long-term management is where we are
 
04:52:27.070 --> 04:52:27.080 align:start position:0%
and that is a zone that we often don't
 
04:52:29.948 --> 04:52:29.958 align:start position:0%
get out of or we can never get out of
 
04:52:31.310 --> 04:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
and that's where the bulk of the money
 
04:52:33.270 --> 04:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
comes from for millions of dollars a
 
04:52:36.548 --> 04:52:36.558 align:start position:0%
year of management so that is the
 
04:52:39.430 --> 04:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
progression that we typically see we do
 
04:52:42.270 --> 04:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
have funding that provides support to
 
04:52:44.510 --> 04:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities and associations across
 
04:52:47.590 --> 04:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
the state we will pay for 100% of a new
 
04:52:49.670 --> 04:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
infestation in a water body with State
 
04:52:51.470 --> 04:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
funding we are funded from boat
 
04:52:54.430 --> 04:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
registration fees a $99.50 fee per boat
 
04:52:56.948 --> 04:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
registration that gives us about
 
04:53:00.190 --> 04:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
$850,000 a year to work with for our
 
04:53:02.670 --> 04:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
budget and you can probably do the math
 
04:53:04.750 --> 04:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
and figure out that if we have million
 
04:53:06.868 --> 04:53:06.878 align:start position:0%
dollars of cost that money does not just
 
04:53:08.788 --> 04:53:08.798 align:start position:0%
come from us we have to have match
 
04:53:11.270 --> 04:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
programs with other entities and
 
04:53:13.470 --> 04:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities and other groups provide
 
04:53:16.590 --> 04:53:16.600 align:start position:0%
that match to do the implementation uh
 
04:53:18.590 --> 04:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
work so a lot of them do warrant
 
04:53:22.190 --> 04:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
articles and capital uh allocations in
 
04:53:24.350 --> 04:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
light on of budgeting to help support
 
04:53:27.310 --> 04:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
those costs so uh it is a big problem
 
04:53:30.510 --> 04:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide and that uh is something that
 
04:53:32.948 --> 04:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
we continue to work on so that is the
 
04:53:35.590 --> 04:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
overview of Aquatic invasives and I'm
 
04:53:37.150 --> 04:53:37.160 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions with my
 
04:53:39.470 --> 04:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
colleagues or on this specifically thank
 
04:53:42.868 --> 04:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
you so very much uh representative comto
 
04:53:45.030 --> 04:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank thank you madam chair um and thank
 
04:53:46.990 --> 04:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
you for your presentation is it possible
 
04:53:48.830 --> 04:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
for you to send that presentation to the
 
04:53:50.670 --> 04:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
committee of course I'll email it to the
 
04:53:53.110 --> 04:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
group yes thank you thank you
 
04:53:56.708 --> 04:53:56.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely y um you're
 
04:54:01.310 --> 04:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
next huh yeah sure uh questions for Amy
 
04:54:04.190 --> 04:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
or for solid waste great uh thank you
 
04:54:06.910 --> 04:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
very much for sharing about the appears
 
04:54:08.750 --> 04:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
like quite a robust program on household
 
04:54:09.990 --> 04:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste that we have in New
 
04:54:12.510 --> 04:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is great um my question
 
04:54:15.948 --> 04:54:15.958 align:start position:0%
is how are we doing in New Hampshire uh
 
04:54:18.430 --> 04:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the solid waste
 
04:54:21.548 --> 04:54:21.558 align:start position:0%
issue which is reduction recycling reuse
 
04:54:23.430 --> 04:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
rather than just burial and landfills or
 
04:54:25.310 --> 04:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
incineration how's that how do we
 
04:54:27.430 --> 04:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
compare with our neighboring states and
 
04:54:29.270 --> 04:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
and uh any suggestions what we might be
 
04:54:31.430 --> 04:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
doing in the future sure thank you for
 
04:54:34.430 --> 04:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
the question so yeah we reduction you
 
04:54:37.270 --> 04:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
know it's baked into the statute that
 
04:54:38.708 --> 04:54:38.718 align:start position:0%
reduction of waste and avoiding
 
04:54:40.750 --> 04:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
generating in the first place and then
 
04:54:42.868 --> 04:54:42.878 align:start position:0%
um things like composting and and
 
04:54:45.070 --> 04:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
recycling our preferred methods of
 
04:54:47.350 --> 04:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
managing waste and and we are working
 
04:54:50.030 --> 04:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
hard to do that we for many years our
 
04:54:51.948 --> 04:54:51.958 align:start position:0%
our Bureau was underresourced in terms
 
04:54:53.750 --> 04:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
of have not really having the staff to
 
04:54:56.350 --> 04:54:56.360 align:start position:0%
help Advance those kinds of programs in
 
04:54:58.430 --> 04:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
recent years we begun to get staffed up
 
04:54:59.708 --> 04:54:59.718 align:start position:0%
again and that's been really helpful
 
04:55:03.150 --> 04:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
we've also had great support and and um
 
04:55:05.190 --> 04:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
guidance from the legislature and from
 
04:55:06.788 --> 04:55:06.798 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group which
 
04:55:09.750 --> 04:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
meets monthly to provide guidance to us
 
04:55:12.110 --> 04:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
and and talk talk about um advancing
 
04:55:15.390 --> 04:55:15.400 align:start position:0%
different um uh initiatives to try to
 
04:55:18.310 --> 04:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
reduce waste a few years ago there was a
 
04:55:21.910 --> 04:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
a bill pass to change the statutory
 
04:55:24.470 --> 04:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
language regarding setting waste
 
04:55:27.110 --> 04:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
disposal reduction goals for the state
 
04:55:29.470 --> 04:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
and we're working hard to address those
 
04:55:31.788 --> 04:55:31.798 align:start position:0%
um we have a number of programs now
 
04:55:34.070 --> 04:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
where we're trying to educate uh right
 
04:55:35.868 --> 04:55:35.878 align:start position:0%
at the Grassroots level making sure we
 
04:55:37.990 --> 04:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
educate the public about how and where
 
04:55:39.788 --> 04:55:39.798 align:start position:0%
they can recycle things we provided a
 
04:55:42.750 --> 04:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
lot of new information on our website to
 
04:55:46.070 --> 04:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
help educate um uh the public about how
 
04:55:48.510 --> 04:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
to reduce waste and how to recycle waste
 
04:55:51.510 --> 04:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
that they might generate we also are
 
04:55:54.150 --> 04:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
getting more in a position now with some
 
04:55:56.390 --> 04:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
limited Staffing at least to help
 
04:55:58.150 --> 04:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
provide more technical assistance to
 
04:56:00.670 --> 04:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
communities into towns and the training
 
04:56:03.150 --> 04:56:03.160 align:start position:0%
because really the the way that waste
 
04:56:04.788 --> 04:56:04.798 align:start position:0%
gets managed in New Hampshire and the
 
04:56:06.110 --> 04:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
way that people learn about what they
 
04:56:08.470 --> 04:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
can do to limit their waste is really
 
04:56:10.390 --> 04:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
kind of a very Municipal thing most
 
04:56:12.270 --> 04:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
people that live in New Hampshire if
 
04:56:14.110 --> 04:56:14.120 align:start position:0%
they don't have curbside pickup or even
 
04:56:16.030 --> 04:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
if they do they also have a transfer
 
04:56:18.150 --> 04:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
station in their town which is a a hub
 
04:56:20.628 --> 04:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
in the town where they can go and uh
 
04:56:22.628 --> 04:56:22.638 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to recycle various
 
04:56:24.628 --> 04:56:24.638 align:start position:0%
materials and get and handle materials
 
04:56:26.830 --> 04:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
in in ways that don't necessarily
 
04:56:29.190 --> 04:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
include just ultimate Landfield disposal
 
04:56:30.948 --> 04:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
so we're making progress there I think
 
04:56:32.868 --> 04:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
if I was asked to compare to other
 
04:56:34.750 --> 04:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
states we're probably a little behind
 
04:56:36.548 --> 04:56:36.558 align:start position:0%
because many of those other states have
 
04:56:39.190 --> 04:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
put a lot of resources and um have
 
04:56:41.628 --> 04:56:41.638 align:start position:0%
passed laws to help help Advance some of
 
04:56:44.470 --> 04:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
those restrictive uh you know uh
 
04:56:46.670 --> 04:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
programs that help uh limit the amount
 
04:56:48.830 --> 04:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
of waste that's disposed of in landfills
 
04:56:51.110 --> 04:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
for example both Vermont and
 
04:56:54.230 --> 04:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts have had uh Organics
 
04:56:57.350 --> 04:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
waistbands that started 10 years ago and
 
04:56:59.070 --> 04:56:59.080 align:start position:0%
then have advanced to a point where in
 
04:57:01.670 --> 04:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
Vermont virtually all organic waste is
 
04:57:03.470 --> 04:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
is is prohibited from being disposed of
 
04:57:05.628 --> 04:57:05.638 align:start position:0%
in a landfill we're kind of at the baby
 
04:57:07.548 --> 04:57:07.558 align:start position:0%
steps now we have that first bill which
 
04:57:09.030 --> 04:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
is very similar to what Vermont passed
 
04:57:10.830 --> 04:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
many years ago which says if you
 
04:57:14.548 --> 04:57:14.558 align:start position:0%
generate greater than um a 100 tons of
 
04:57:16.830 --> 04:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
of waste excuse me if you generate
 
04:57:19.390 --> 04:57:19.400 align:start position:0%
greater than one ton of waste per week
 
04:57:21.708 --> 04:57:21.718 align:start position:0%
um you you need to make sure that you
 
04:57:23.590 --> 04:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to to landfill that
 
04:57:26.070 --> 04:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
waste if you're located near a facility
 
04:57:28.430 --> 04:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
that can manage it in another way so
 
04:57:29.590 --> 04:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to be implementing that
 
04:57:31.150 --> 04:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to be writing rules for that
 
04:57:32.948 --> 04:57:32.958 align:start position:0%
we're doing a a waste characterization
 
04:57:35.830 --> 04:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
study across all types of waste right
 
04:57:38.548 --> 04:57:38.558 align:start position:0%
now but also specifically looking to do
 
04:57:41.310 --> 04:57:41.320 align:start position:0%
a study to understand what the organic
 
04:57:43.628 --> 04:57:43.638 align:start position:0%
waste sources are in our state and how
 
04:57:45.110 --> 04:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
those might be managed so that we can
 
04:57:47.350 --> 04:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
Implement that wasteband in a way that
 
04:57:49.948 --> 04:57:49.958 align:start position:0%
will really help um our communities to
 
04:57:51.868 --> 04:57:51.878 align:start position:0%
start uh reducing the amount of organic
 
04:57:54.030 --> 04:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
was that they send to a landfill that's
 
04:57:57.230 --> 04:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
a lot but I appr thank you and I'd like
 
04:58:01.190 --> 04:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
to uh have uh Miss magula give us um
 
04:58:04.070 --> 04:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
your title what what's your title Chief
 
04:58:07.070 --> 04:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
acatic biologist Chief aquatic biologist
 
04:58:11.670 --> 04:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
thank you okay uh questions represent
 
04:58:14.910 --> 04:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
Penza um just one thing was the
 
04:58:16.350 --> 04:58:16.360 align:start position:0%
presentation you're going to be able to
 
04:58:18.070 --> 04:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
send that out that was my first one and
 
04:58:21.430 --> 04:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
then my second one is um
 
04:58:24.670 --> 04:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
the uh Department of Agriculture had
 
04:58:27.910 --> 04:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
right in like their second slide had put
 
04:58:30.750 --> 04:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
um some information on the on the budget
 
04:58:33.548 --> 04:58:33.558 align:start position:0%
and they had outlined um all of their
 
04:58:35.390 --> 04:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
different employees and stuff like that
 
04:58:37.150 --> 04:58:37.160 align:start position:0%
is that something that um New Hampshire
 
04:58:39.430 --> 04:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
Dees could provide to the committee I
 
04:58:41.830 --> 04:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
think it's very helpful sure you're
 
04:58:43.390 --> 04:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
talking about an org chart that shows
 
04:58:45.590 --> 04:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
the number of positions and positions
 
04:58:48.670 --> 04:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
and and exactly and um what the budget
 
04:58:50.110 --> 04:58:50.120 align:start position:0%
was for
 
04:58:53.310 --> 04:58:53.320 align:start position:0%
2025 um from general fund other they
 
04:58:55.390 --> 04:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
have yeah they have it all kind of be
 
04:58:56.948 --> 04:58:56.958 align:start position:0%
really helpful for us as you can imagine
 
04:58:57.990 --> 04:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
we're in a budget year so we're
 
04:58:59.470 --> 04:58:59.480 align:start position:0%
preparing all that material and I'll
 
04:59:00.830 --> 04:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
I'll look at what would be the most
 
04:59:02.150 --> 04:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
helpful and we'll try to send something
 
04:59:03.868 --> 04:59:03.878 align:start position:0%
along to the committee that'd be great
 
04:59:07.470 --> 04:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
yeah they had broken it down by um the
 
04:59:10.350 --> 04:59:10.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2025 authorized how much
 
04:59:12.868 --> 04:59:12.878 align:start position:0%
they were authorized how much was coming
 
04:59:14.590 --> 04:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
from the general fund how much money
 
04:59:16.868 --> 04:59:16.878 align:start position:0%
they were getting from other sources how
 
04:59:18.110 --> 04:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
much money they were getting from the
 
04:59:22.910 --> 04:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
federal government um and the total
 
04:59:22.920 --> 04:59:24.708 align:start position:0%
federal government um and the total
unrestricted

04:59:24.708 --> 04:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
unrestricted
 
04:59:24.718 --> 04:59:26.628 align:start position:0%
unrestricted
revenues

04:59:26.628 --> 04:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
04:59:29.670 --> 04:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
followup yeah sure I'm I'm sure we can
 
04:59:31.868 --> 04:59:31.878 align:start position:0%
provide that I'm sorry what' you say I
 
04:59:33.310 --> 04:59:33.320 align:start position:0%
just had a followup sure go ahead
 
04:59:35.670 --> 04:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
followup yes so when they had um done
 
04:59:37.590 --> 04:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
that I had asked for them to give like a
 
04:59:40.270 --> 04:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
comparison so they gave us 25 and just
 
04:59:42.868 --> 04:59:42.878 align:start position:0%
to see okay well where were we you know
 
04:59:44.948 --> 04:59:44.958 align:start position:0%
four or five years ago compared to now
 
04:59:46.948 --> 04:59:46.958 align:start position:0%
so they were going to be um able to
 
04:59:48.750 --> 04:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
provide us that information it would be
 
04:59:52.110 --> 04:59:52.120 align:start position:0%
great just to have that perspective um
 
04:59:55.110 --> 04:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
my other piece of that is if if it's
 
04:59:59.030 --> 04:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
broken out specifically um besides de
 
05:00:02.190 --> 05:00:02.200 align:start position:0%
DHHS Dees received um the greatest
 
05:00:05.868 --> 05:00:05.878 align:start position:0%
number of arpa funds um actually uh
 
05:00:08.150 --> 05:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
pretty much New Hampshire got more Dees
 
05:00:10.510 --> 05:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire got more than any another
 
05:00:12.670 --> 05:00:12.680 align:start position:0%
um Environmental Service Agency in the
 
05:00:16.110 --> 05:00:16.120 align:start position:0%
country so I'd like that spelled out too
 
05:00:18.150 --> 05:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
how much you guys got just in staff
 
05:00:20.788 --> 05:00:20.798 align:start position:0%
alone you got it's got over $6 million
 
05:00:22.750 --> 05:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
so I just like to see where all those
 
05:00:25.190 --> 05:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
things are kind of at sure we we've been
 
05:00:26.750 --> 05:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
doing a tremendous amount of work with
 
05:00:29.030 --> 05:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
arpa funds providing assistance to
 
05:00:31.670 --> 05:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
communities across the state and uh that
 
05:00:33.110 --> 05:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
information is being compiled and I'm
 
05:00:34.548 --> 05:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
sure I can provide something that will
 
05:00:36.990 --> 05:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
help illustrate that to the committee
 
05:00:40.590 --> 05:00:40.600 align:start position:0%
okay representative Bixby yes so um
 
05:00:44.590 --> 05:00:44.600 align:start position:0%
getting back to the uh organic wasteband
 
05:00:47.628 --> 05:00:47.638 align:start position:0%
um that so that is coming online in the
 
05:00:51.270 --> 05:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
next month I believe and I was wondering
 
05:00:53.868 --> 05:00:53.878 align:start position:0%
uh where do we stand in terms of uh
 
05:00:56.670 --> 05:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
facilities that are able to uh take that
 
05:00:59.350 --> 05:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
waste and deal with it sure well and it
 
05:01:01.270 --> 05:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
it took us some time to get the position
 
05:01:03.510 --> 05:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
that was created hired and on board and
 
05:01:05.430 --> 05:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
they're working hard that and they've
 
05:01:08.510 --> 05:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
been focusing on getting uh requests for
 
05:01:10.910 --> 05:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh proposals out for the the Organics
 
05:01:13.430 --> 05:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
waste study that we'll be conducting and
 
05:01:14.948 --> 05:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
then also their priority will be getting
 
05:01:17.070 --> 05:01:17.080 align:start position:0%
rules going so I think there was an
 
05:01:20.390 --> 05:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
article recently in which uh um she was
 
05:01:22.708 --> 05:01:22.718 align:start position:0%
uh um Jenny Mitchell is her name by the
 
05:01:25.110 --> 05:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
way and she was interviewed and uh it
 
05:01:26.430 --> 05:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
was a good article that sort of
 
05:01:28.430 --> 05:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
explained that our initial approach to
 
05:01:30.788 --> 05:01:30.798 align:start position:0%
this is going to be to really understand
 
05:01:32.270 --> 05:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
what the lay of the land is what we've
 
05:01:33.868 --> 05:01:33.878 align:start position:0%
got for generators out there what we
 
05:01:35.990 --> 05:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
have for existing facilities or
 
05:01:38.310 --> 05:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
facilities that are looking to size up
 
05:01:40.788 --> 05:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
and and be and provide more Capac capity
 
05:01:42.310 --> 05:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
it's really going to be educational in
 
05:01:44.390 --> 05:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
the beginning because we we we need to
 
05:01:46.430 --> 05:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
get the regulated Community the folks
 
05:01:48.310 --> 05:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
who are going to be subject to this
 
05:01:50.070 --> 05:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
understanding what the rules are going
 
05:01:52.830 --> 05:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
to require and where they can go to
 
05:01:54.628 --> 05:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
manage their waste in an alternative
 
05:01:56.390 --> 05:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
fashion so there's going to be you know
 
05:01:57.310 --> 05:01:57.320 align:start position:0%
it's not like we're going to be out
 
05:01:58.868 --> 05:01:58.878 align:start position:0%
there doing inspections next month to
 
05:02:00.670 --> 05:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
see who's complying we're really trying
 
05:02:04.150 --> 05:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
to um get a program stood up and get
 
05:02:05.788 --> 05:02:05.798 align:start position:0%
people educated as to how it's going to
 
05:02:08.070 --> 05:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
work and but we're uh we're dedicated to
 
05:02:10.510 --> 05:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
getting that done thank representative
 
05:02:13.628 --> 05:02:13.638 align:start position:0%
Scully is next and then we'll have um
 
05:02:15.230 --> 05:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
05:02:17.548 --> 05:02:17.558 align:start position:0%
coming today to speak with us uh what is
 
05:02:19.830 --> 05:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
the relationship between solid waste and
 
05:02:21.910 --> 05:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
the dees because listening to you what
 
05:02:23.270 --> 05:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're actually doing the
 
05:02:25.070 --> 05:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
majority of the cleanups in New
 
05:02:27.628 --> 05:02:27.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that true or H how is that
 
05:02:29.470 --> 05:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
distributed between the two
 
05:02:32.270 --> 05:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
departments um I'm not sure I understand
 
05:02:34.830 --> 05:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
your question I mean DS is the the
 
05:02:38.070 --> 05:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
agency that is T it is tasked by this
 
05:02:41.030 --> 05:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature in RSA 49m which is a
 
05:02:43.548 --> 05:02:43.558 align:start position:0%
solid waste management act to regulate
 
05:02:45.430 --> 05:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
and administer a permit system for
 
05:02:47.230 --> 05:02:47.240 align:start position:0%
proper management of solid waste in the
 
05:02:49.548 --> 05:02:49.558 align:start position:0%
state um are you asking compared to
 
05:02:51.628 --> 05:02:51.638 align:start position:0%
another agency or I'm sorry just not
 
05:02:54.830 --> 05:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
sure okay forgive me for being unclear
 
05:02:56.270 --> 05:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
but it did sound like I mean you you
 
05:02:57.910 --> 05:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
have the oil remediation fund you have
 
05:03:00.948 --> 05:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
the MTP fund uh hazardous waste it
 
05:03:02.270 --> 05:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
sounded like you were administering all
 
05:03:05.350 --> 05:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
the cleanups of those sites so it seemed
 
05:03:06.628 --> 05:03:06.638 align:start position:0%
like all of that work was being done
 
05:03:09.190 --> 05:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
through the the Solid Waste Department
 
05:03:11.070 --> 05:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
uh no actually um so the waste
 
05:03:12.750 --> 05:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
management division is bigger than just
 
05:03:14.548 --> 05:03:14.558 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste you know the five bureaus
 
05:03:17.510 --> 05:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
that we described here today um cover we
 
05:03:20.430 --> 05:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
have a very large um scope of work if it
 
05:03:23.190 --> 05:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
if you will um we um have uh under
 
05:03:26.110 --> 05:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
separate laws RSA 147a establishes the
 
05:03:28.030 --> 05:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
Hazardous Waste requirements we're
 
05:03:30.230 --> 05:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
tasked with with the waste division is
 
05:03:34.510 --> 05:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
tasked with administering that um 146
 
05:03:38.310 --> 05:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
RSA 146 C and D establish the oil the
 
05:03:40.390 --> 05:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
the rules and the law that covers
 
05:03:42.708 --> 05:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
management of oil we're tasked with that
 
05:03:46.590 --> 05:03:46.600 align:start position:0%
as well in the division um and so um
 
05:03:47.990 --> 05:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
while Solid Waste is a very important
 
05:03:49.390 --> 05:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
part of what we do it's not the only
 
05:03:50.390 --> 05:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
thing that we
 
05:03:53.628 --> 05:03:53.638 align:start position:0%
do I'm not sure I got to your
 
05:03:55.788 --> 05:03:55.798 align:start position:0%
answer well it just seem for my
 
05:03:57.910 --> 05:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
experience I had done some hazardous way
 
05:04:00.470 --> 05:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
site investigation is in cleanups what
 
05:04:03.990 --> 05:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
your funding mechanisms to pay for
 
05:04:07.030 --> 05:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
covered almost everything that I used to
 
05:04:08.990 --> 05:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
deal with and do so it just seemed like
 
05:04:11.110 --> 05:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
it was more in your purview that it was
 
05:04:14.868 --> 05:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
over a Dees do you think I'm missing his
 
05:04:19.708 --> 05:04:19.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:23.590 --> 05:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
of what I was going to share is that um
 
05:04:26.070 --> 05:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
much of the work that gets done
 
05:04:28.310 --> 05:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
regarding hazardous waste sites and oil
 
05:04:30.708 --> 05:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
sites is done by um environmental
 
05:04:33.070 --> 05:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
Consultants or private contractor
 
05:04:36.750 --> 05:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
scientists of some sort and um we uh
 
05:04:38.990 --> 05:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
oversee their work in one fashion or
 
05:04:42.628 --> 05:04:42.638 align:start position:0%
another um most often by them submitting
 
05:04:44.708 --> 05:04:44.718 align:start position:0%
reports to us and US checking to make
 
05:04:46.670 --> 05:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
sure that what they've done meets the
 
05:04:49.910 --> 05:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
requirements does that help yes it does
 
05:04:53.270 --> 05:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you sure uh one more question
 
05:04:54.788 --> 05:04:54.798 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler because we're
 
05:04:57.510 --> 05:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
we're running a little late and um I
 
05:04:59.510 --> 05:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
after your question is answered I want
 
05:05:01.708 --> 05:05:01.718 align:start position:0%
to take a couple minute break and then
 
05:05:03.948 --> 05:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
we can have uh our food safety division
 
05:05:06.548 --> 05:05:06.558 align:start position:0%
folks come and talk thank you thank you
 
05:05:09.030 --> 05:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
chair eron this should be pretty easy I
 
05:05:10.310 --> 05:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
just have a question questions about the
 
05:05:12.390 --> 05:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund Advisory Board
 
05:05:13.868 --> 05:05:13.878 align:start position:0%
who appoints to that board is the
 
05:05:15.548 --> 05:05:15.558 align:start position:0%
governor the speaker the Senate
 
05:05:17.750 --> 05:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
President right so that that is actually
 
05:05:22.150 --> 05:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
I think a 21 member commission and it is
 
05:05:24.310 --> 05:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh largely appointed by the governor
 
05:05:27.270 --> 05:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
there are some uh positions that stem
 
05:05:28.750 --> 05:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
from the position so there's a there's
 
05:05:31.070 --> 05:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
always a design from from the dees
 
05:05:32.910 --> 05:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
there's a design from business and
 
05:05:35.548 --> 05:05:35.558 align:start position:0%
economic Affairs um and then for there
 
05:05:38.590 --> 05:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
are some legislative uh designes and
 
05:05:40.270 --> 05:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
then many of the other I believe most of
 
05:05:42.708 --> 05:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
the other positions are are are then
 
05:05:45.708 --> 05:05:45.718 align:start position:0%
they may cover certain areas or sectors
 
05:05:48.150 --> 05:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
of uh of the economy if you will people
 
05:05:50.670 --> 05:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
who are you know members of the
 
05:05:52.150 --> 05:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
Wastewater Treatment Community or The
 
05:05:53.948 --> 05:05:53.958 align:start position:0%
Drinking Water Treatment Community but I
 
05:05:55.750 --> 05:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
think most of those are nominated by the
 
05:05:58.590 --> 05:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
governor quick followup quick followup
 
05:06:00.708 --> 05:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
just so I have my notes fully complete
 
05:06:04.510 --> 05:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
here now you said a certain percentage
 
05:06:05.990 --> 05:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
of the state gets their water from Mill
 
05:06:07.868 --> 05:06:07.878 align:start position:0%
and you knew from uh Wells and you knew
 
05:06:09.708 --> 05:06:09.718 align:start position:0%
that off the top of your head what is
 
05:06:11.708 --> 05:06:11.718 align:start position:0%
the percentage of I think the number
 
05:06:12.910 --> 05:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
we're working with right now is that
 
05:06:15.510 --> 05:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
about 45% of the state's population gets
 
05:06:17.548 --> 05:06:17.558 align:start position:0%
its well from a private gets its
 
05:06:19.750 --> 05:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
drinking water from a private drink
 
05:06:21.670 --> 05:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
individual drinking water well as
 
05:06:23.270 --> 05:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
opposed to being connected to either a
 
05:06:25.310 --> 05:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
community water system or a large
 
05:06:27.430 --> 05:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
Municipal public water system thank you
 
05:06:29.470 --> 05:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
director wson you're welcome thank you
 
05:06:32.670 --> 05:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
so much well I want to is it a quick
 
05:06:35.430 --> 05:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
question yes okay quick I'll allow one
 
05:06:38.788 --> 05:06:38.798 align:start position:0%
more that's it okay uh it's more of a
 
05:06:40.590 --> 05:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
asking for information so it goes back
 
05:06:44.470 --> 05:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
to the MTB remediation Bureau piece um
 
05:06:46.310 --> 05:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
one of the questions he just answered in
 
05:06:48.390 --> 05:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
regards with that are anybody on is on
 
05:06:49.990 --> 05:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
that commission are they
 
05:06:52.190 --> 05:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
paid the drinking water and groundwater
 
05:06:54.670 --> 05:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
trust fund commission um no I don't
 
05:06:56.590 --> 05:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
there's there's no I I believe they
 
05:06:58.230 --> 05:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
might get reimbursed for mileage if they
 
05:06:59.910 --> 05:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
seek it but I don't believe there's
 
05:07:02.510 --> 05:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
there's no salaries or or stiens or
 
05:07:03.830 --> 05:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
anything associated with that those are
 
05:07:06.190 --> 05:07:06.200 align:start position:0%
volunteer positions so I used to go to
 
05:07:07.628 --> 05:07:07.638 align:start position:0%
the website all the time where it had
 
05:07:09.868 --> 05:07:09.878 align:start position:0%
everything outlined does is that still
 
05:07:11.750 --> 05:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
there where it shows how much is left
 
05:07:14.628 --> 05:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
left in the trust how the trust has been
 
05:07:16.990 --> 05:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
dispersed we still do have a yes we we
 
05:07:18.430 --> 05:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely maintain a website for that
 
05:07:20.070 --> 05:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
and it should be up to date okay
 
05:07:21.830 --> 05:07:21.840 align:start position:0%

05:18:42.070 --> 05:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
required to have two inspections they'll
 
05:18:44.910 --> 05:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
have a pre-operational inspection um and
 
05:18:48.110 --> 05:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
then within um 90 days they'll have a
 
05:18:51.070 --> 05:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
final inspection um when they're they're
 
05:18:56.230 --> 05:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:58.270 --> 05:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
operating and sorry I just wanted to go
 
05:19:01.190 --> 05:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
back we have um about nine and a half um
 
05:19:03.948 --> 05:19:03.958 align:start position:0%
full-time equivalents that um do the
 
05:19:07.110 --> 05:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:09.868 --> 05:19:09.878 align:start position:0%
program so I added a slide in here for
 
05:19:11.868 --> 05:19:11.878 align:start position:0%
Homestead food operations just to give a
 
05:19:14.670 --> 05:19:14.680 align:start position:0%
quick overview because I I know that um
 
05:19:18.868 --> 05:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
this committee he has many um bills uh
 
05:19:22.470 --> 05:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
for uh Homestead food operators um so we
 
05:19:24.590 --> 05:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
have two types of Homestead food
 
05:19:26.868 --> 05:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
operations we have the non-exempt the
 
05:19:28.910 --> 05:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
licensed and inspect that are licensed
 
05:19:30.390 --> 05:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
and inspected by
 
05:19:34.310 --> 05:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
DHHS and we have the exempt um which are
 
05:19:36.390 --> 05:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
not licensed or inspected
 
05:19:39.310 --> 05:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
by um by our program
 
05:19:43.948 --> 05:19:43.958 align:start position:0%
um these exempt Homestead operations are
 
05:19:45.548 --> 05:19:45.558 align:start position:0%
limited to where they can sell their
 
05:19:49.030 --> 05:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
products uh to their own home Farmstead
 
05:19:53.590 --> 05:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
farmers markets and retail stores and
 
05:19:55.788 --> 05:19:55.798 align:start position:0%
the food products that are allowed to be
 
05:19:58.350 --> 05:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
sold um by Homestead food operators are
 
05:20:00.110 --> 05:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
foods that do not require refrigeration
 
05:20:03.830 --> 05:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
for safety um or non-tcs food products
 
05:20:06.030 --> 05:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
non potentially hazardous
 
05:20:09.030 --> 05:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
also um these include baked goods um
 
05:20:11.230 --> 05:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
including breads muffins cookies
 
05:20:13.830 --> 05:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
brownies uh we have candies they can do
 
05:20:17.590 --> 05:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
lollipops chocolate fudge um packaged
 
05:20:20.788 --> 05:20:20.798 align:start position:0%
dry products such as granola spices soup
 
05:20:25.390 --> 05:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
mixes jams or jellies um acidified Foods
 
05:20:28.390 --> 05:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh including barbecue sauces mustards or
 
05:20:32.590 --> 05:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
vinegars and then as of last um session
 
05:20:35.350 --> 05:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
they are now allowed to do acidified
 
05:20:37.510 --> 05:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
Foods um in their home including things
 
05:20:40.350 --> 05:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
like salsas um and
 
05:20:42.310 --> 05:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
pickles um these Homestead food
 
05:20:46.590 --> 05:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
operators um have uh limited um I'm
 
05:20:49.230 --> 05:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
sorry minimal physical facilities
 
05:20:52.270 --> 05:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
requirements so they are using their
 
05:20:52.280 --> 05:20:56.750 align:start position:0%
requirements so they are using their
residential

05:20:56.750 --> 05:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:59.788 --> 05:20:59.798 align:start position:0%
kitchen so a little bit about um our
 
05:21:03.470 --> 05:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
inspections um we have adopted the 2017
 
05:21:06.510 --> 05:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
Federal food code um by reference in our
 
05:21:06.520 --> 05:21:09.030 align:start position:0%
Federal food code um by reference in our
rule

05:21:09.030 --> 05:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
rule
 
05:21:11.310 --> 05:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
and our inspectors um licens and inspect
 
05:21:14.270 --> 05:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
to to this food code um our inspectors
 
05:21:16.230 --> 05:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
may have as many as six to 700
 
05:21:17.788 --> 05:21:17.798 align:start position:0%
facilities in their
 
05:21:20.750 --> 05:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
districts they are based um out of their
 
05:21:23.548 --> 05:21:23.558 align:start position:0%
home so their district is generally
 
05:21:27.390 --> 05:21:27.400 align:start position:0%
focused around um around their home base
 
05:21:29.948 --> 05:21:29.958 align:start position:0%
they may travel up to an hour to an hour
 
05:21:33.230 --> 05:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
and 15 minutes from their home
 
05:21:36.948 --> 05:21:36.958 align:start position:0%
um uh within their District um our
 
05:21:40.910 --> 05:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
facilities may be in are inspected uh
 
05:21:43.470 --> 05:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
either every 12 month from 12 months to
 
05:21:47.788 --> 05:21:47.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:52.190 --> 05:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
risk and this is just a map um the
 
05:21:54.350 --> 05:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
colors show the different districts of
 
05:21:54.360 --> 05:21:55.708 align:start position:0%
colors show the different districts of
our

05:21:55.708 --> 05:21:55.718 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:22:00.030 --> 05:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
inspectors and then the towns in white
 
05:22:01.150 --> 05:22:01.160 align:start position:0%
um are the self- inspecting
 
05:22:03.230 --> 05:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions who are responsible for
 
05:22:05.910 --> 05:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
their own licensing inspection of um
 
05:22:11.510 --> 05:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:15.150 --> 05:22:15.160 align:start position:0%
so food protection um does not regulate
 
05:22:19.708 --> 05:22:19.718 align:start position:0%
um specific um events and
 
05:22:21.830 --> 05:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
establishments um food establishments
 
05:22:23.830 --> 05:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
that are as I mentioned located in self-
 
05:22:25.788 --> 05:22:25.798 align:start position:0%
inspecting jurisdictions we do not
 
05:22:26.990 --> 05:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
license or
 
05:22:29.548 --> 05:22:29.558 align:start position:0%
inspect we have um temporary food
 
05:22:31.430 --> 05:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
establishments um these are associated
 
05:22:32.948 --> 05:22:32.958 align:start position:0%
with fairs or festivals that are
 
05:22:36.470 --> 05:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
operating less than um that are a fixed
 
05:22:39.868 --> 05:22:39.878 align:start position:0%
location operating less than two weeks
 
05:22:41.708 --> 05:22:41.718 align:start position:0%
we have occasional Food Service
 
05:22:44.150 --> 05:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
establishments and events and these are
 
05:22:47.470 --> 05:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
generally anyone operating um 4 days
 
05:22:50.590 --> 05:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
within a 30day period less than four
 
05:22:52.110 --> 05:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
days in a 30-day period we do not
 
05:22:55.110 --> 05:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
license our inspect uh food pantries and
 
05:22:57.788 --> 05:22:57.798 align:start position:0%
soup kitchens um and then Child Care
 
05:23:00.150 --> 05:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
Centers youth camps and nursing homes
 
05:23:04.190 --> 05:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
are um licensed and inspected by other
 
05:23:17.830 --> 05:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:19.670 --> 05:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
so there are some food products that we
 
05:23:22.350 --> 05:23:22.360 align:start position:0%
do not we also do not um regulate and
 
05:23:26.470 --> 05:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
these are um eggs maple syrup honey
 
05:23:28.350 --> 05:23:28.360 align:start position:0%
produce and pet foods and those are all
 
05:23:30.750 --> 05:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
covered by the Department of Agriculture
 
05:23:32.830 --> 05:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
the only time that we are involved with
 
05:23:34.708 --> 05:23:34.718 align:start position:0%
products like this is if they're um
 
05:23:39.190 --> 05:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
adding to them so if they're making uh
 
05:23:42.190 --> 05:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
honey with um they're they're making a
 
05:23:42.200 --> 05:23:43.270 align:start position:0%
honey with um they're they're making a
product

05:23:43.270 --> 05:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
product
 
05:23:46.430 --> 05:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
from with these products or they're
 
05:23:50.270 --> 05:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
taking um whole produce and uh producing
 
05:23:53.070 --> 05:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
salads then then they would fall into um
 
05:23:54.708 --> 05:23:54.718 align:start position:0%
our regulation otherwise these are
 
05:23:59.590 --> 05:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:01.470 --> 05:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
Agriculture uh the next program I'll
 
05:24:04.030 --> 05:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
talk about is our smallest program it's
 
05:24:06.948 --> 05:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
our beverage and bottled water program
 
05:24:09.510 --> 05:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
um we have a wide range of producers
 
05:24:11.868 --> 05:24:11.878 align:start position:0%
even though it's very small um in this
 
05:24:15.350 --> 05:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
program so we have um plants as big as
 
05:24:17.548 --> 05:24:17.558 align:start position:0%
the Coca-Cola plant in London Derry and
 
05:24:20.948 --> 05:24:20.958 align:start position:0%
we've had producers as small as um a
 
05:24:22.910 --> 05:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
high school student making a case of
 
05:24:25.910 --> 05:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
soda a week to sell um at a farmers's
 
05:24:29.590 --> 05:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
market so this is a small program but
 
05:24:31.670 --> 05:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
has a wide range of of facilities that
 
05:24:31.680 --> 05:24:33.510 align:start position:0%
has a wide range of of facilities that
we

05:24:33.510 --> 05:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:24:36.628 --> 05:24:36.638 align:start position:0%
regulate and we have about 23 of these
 
05:24:39.750 --> 05:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
facilities licensed that manufacturer um
 
05:24:41.830 --> 05:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
in state and then we also register out
 
05:24:43.708 --> 05:24:43.718 align:start position:0%
of state manufacturer so any bottled
 
05:24:46.750 --> 05:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
waters bottled water or beverage coming
 
05:24:50.708 --> 05:24:50.718 align:start position:0%
into the state um they register um they
 
05:24:53.548 --> 05:24:53.558 align:start position:0%
register with with New Hampshire and we
 
05:24:59.310 --> 05:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:02.030 --> 05:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
currently the next program is our Dairy
 
05:25:04.750 --> 05:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
sanitation program and this program is
 
05:25:08.030 --> 05:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
an FDA Cooperative program so any milk
 
05:25:11.470 --> 05:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
that is crossing state lines um needs to
 
05:25:15.548 --> 05:25:15.558 align:start position:0%
be inspected at a specific frequency um
 
05:25:18.430 --> 05:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
this FDA Cooperative program also
 
05:25:21.070 --> 05:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
requires the FDA to audit our program to
 
05:25:23.590 --> 05:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're following um the
 
05:25:26.830 --> 05:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
regulations of um the
 
05:25:30.230 --> 05:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
FDA um currently we have about 77 Farms
 
05:25:34.830 --> 05:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
that includes goat goats cows and sheep
 
05:25:37.750 --> 05:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
and we have about 49 processing um
 
05:25:37.760 --> 05:25:39.390 align:start position:0%
and we have about 49 processing um
plants

05:25:39.390 --> 05:25:39.400 align:start position:0%
plants
 
05:25:42.070 --> 05:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
this these Dairy inspections are um
 
05:25:44.788 --> 05:25:44.798 align:start position:0%
carried out by
 
05:25:49.390 --> 05:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
2.75 um full-time equivalents and these
 
05:25:52.750 --> 05:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
um inspectors inspect the Farms the milk
 
05:25:55.350 --> 05:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
plants the milk
 
05:25:58.310 --> 05:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
haulers milk Samplers um and
 
05:26:00.830 --> 05:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
pasteurizers so they do equipment tests
 
05:26:02.230 --> 05:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
um at these
 
05:26:05.230 --> 05:26:05.240 align:start position:0%
facilities they also collect samples um
 
05:26:07.868 --> 05:26:07.878 align:start position:0%
and as last year we've we collected over
 
05:26:11.628 --> 05:26:11.638 align:start position:0%
12 00 Dairy samples and water samples um
 
05:26:13.708 --> 05:26:13.718 align:start position:0%
that made their way through the public
 
05:26:13.718 --> 05:26:19.990 align:start position:0%
that made their way through the public
health

05:26:19.990 --> 05:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:22.230 --> 05:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
lab uh the last program I'm going to
 
05:26:23.990 --> 05:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
talk about is our shellfish program so
 
05:26:26.470 --> 05:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
this is also an FDA Cooperative program
 
05:26:29.510 --> 05:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
um and this regulates moleskin shellfish
 
05:26:33.230 --> 05:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
um this includes oysters uh muscles and
 
05:26:36.350 --> 05:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
clams so any of these products that are
 
05:26:38.230 --> 05:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
going across state line are required
 
05:26:41.470 --> 05:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
ired to be part of the FDA Cooperative
 
05:26:44.510 --> 05:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
program and we work cooperatively with
 
05:26:49.030 --> 05:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
fishing game and Dees um for these um
 
05:26:52.590 --> 05:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
licensed uh firms um to ship across
 
05:26:56.030 --> 05:26:56.040 align:start position:0%

media that there is h a new USDA mandate
 
05:32:34.670 --> 05:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
for states to start state level testing
 
05:32:37.548 --> 05:32:37.558 align:start position:0%

05:32:39.548 --> 05:32:39.558 align:start position:0%
as a the state agency and and yes we
 
05:32:41.830 --> 05:32:41.840 align:start position:0%

daily with Department of Agriculture
 
05:32:45.948 --> 05:32:45.958 align:start position:0%

haven't started that testing it it will
 
05:32:58.350 --> 05:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully with after get granting USDA
 
05:33:00.390 --> 05:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
approval we're hoping to start by the
 
05:33:03.470 --> 05:33:03.480 align:start position:0%

is there going to be a way for the Farms
 
05:33:13.350 --> 05:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
themselves to be able to test or is that
 
05:33:15.470 --> 05:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
just going to be the state through a
 
05:33:18.868 --> 05:33:18.878 align:start position:0%
state or a vet so as I understand it a
 
05:33:21.948 --> 05:33:21.958 align:start position:0%
farm could can work with any farm right
 
05:33:23.948 --> 05:33:23.958 align:start position:0%

05:35:15.230 --> 05:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:35:19.990 --> 05:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
also regarding um food emergencies and
 
05:35:23.270 --> 05:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
food protection roles for power outages
 
05:35:26.788 --> 05:35:26.798 align:start position:0%
floods fires do you have rules that that
 
05:35:30.510 --> 05:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
correspond to how you deal with those or
 
05:35:33.910 --> 05:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
I mean in in in Dees I mean um DHHS
 
05:35:37.628 --> 05:35:37.638 align:start position:0%
rules or is it just some protocols that
 
05:35:43.150 --> 05:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
you follow yeah sure So within HP 2300
 
05:35:45.750 --> 05:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
are the administrative rules there is
 
05:35:48.590 --> 05:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
requirements for food establishments for
 
05:35:51.628 --> 05:35:51.638 align:start position:0%
reporting eminent health hazards to us
 
05:35:53.990 --> 05:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
and there's different criteria so it's a
 
05:35:56.270 --> 05:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
power outage lasting greater than than
 
05:36:00.990 --> 05:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
two hours it's um a fire a flood a a
 
05:36:03.270 --> 05:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
contaminated water source they're
 
05:36:05.350 --> 05:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
they're obligated to report those to us
 
05:36:08.470 --> 05:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
and based on the situation we will work
 
05:36:10.670 --> 05:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
with them um we as Erica had mentioned
 
05:36:12.270 --> 05:36:12.280 align:start position:0%
earlier we do have what's called our
 
05:36:14.030 --> 05:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
emergency action plan for food
 
05:36:16.868 --> 05:36:16.878 align:start position:0%
establishments which is it's it's been a
 
05:36:18.990 --> 05:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
long-standing guidance document that we
 
05:36:21.470 --> 05:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
have we distributed hard copies but we
 
05:36:23.270 --> 05:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
also have it available on our website to
 
05:36:25.708 --> 05:36:25.718 align:start position:0%
give food establishments guidance on
 
05:36:27.270 --> 05:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
what they do if if they're notified they
 
05:36:29.390 --> 05:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
have a boil order for example at their
 
05:36:31.430 --> 05:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
establishment so they don't necessarily
 
05:36:32.868 --> 05:36:32.878 align:start position:0%
have to shut down but these are the
 
05:36:35.190 --> 05:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
precautions that they have to to take
 
05:36:36.948 --> 05:36:36.958 align:start position:0%
obviously if it's a if it's a fire
 
05:36:38.150 --> 05:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
that's completely destroyed their
 
05:36:39.270 --> 05:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
building that that's a different
 
05:36:40.990 --> 05:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
situation they won't be able to continue
 
05:36:43.750 --> 05:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
operations but we work it's basically on
 
05:36:46.230 --> 05:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
a case-by casee basis if they report
 
05:36:48.670 --> 05:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
this to us we work with them on how they
 
05:36:51.070 --> 05:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
can mitigate any food safety risk um
 
05:36:52.270 --> 05:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
they might have it might involve
 
05:36:54.110 --> 05:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
disposal of food for example if it was
 
05:36:56.350 --> 05:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
contaminated with flood waters um but
 
05:36:58.868 --> 05:36:58.878 align:start position:0%
each situation is a little bit different
 
05:37:00.548 --> 05:37:00.558 align:start position:0%
however there is that overall guidance
 
05:37:03.150 --> 05:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
document on the department's
 
05:37:03.160 --> 05:37:05.030 align:start position:0%
