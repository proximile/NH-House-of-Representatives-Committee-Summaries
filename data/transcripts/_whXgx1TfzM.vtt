00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett is here in
 
00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
in spirit and uh
 
00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
i assume
 
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
she has one of yours uh
 
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
email or text number so she can text you
 
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.029 align:start position:0%
email or text number so she can text you
guys

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
guys
 
00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:37.189 align:start position:0%
guys
okay

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:38.309 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 align:start position:0%
i think this is going to be fairly
 
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
straightforward and all the morning
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
bills were pretty pretty straightforward
 
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.830 align:start position:0%
bills were pretty pretty straightforward
um

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.629 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
and then we just have and i have some
 
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
new insights now on some of these later
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
bills so
 
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
and do i know who who's on the insurance
 
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:09.589 align:start position:0%
and do i know who who's on the insurance
subcommittee

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
i don't i think john dwight do we
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
actually have the subcommittee
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
notions okay how many forms do you have
 
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.950 align:start position:0%
notions okay how many forms do you have
there

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully one for each bill but okay
 
00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
cool okay so that should be double we
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
should have the members on it
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
i don't have
 
00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:31.110 align:start position:0%
i don't have
so

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
you know what that's this i'm not gonna
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
worry about it
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
i think everything i think these are
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
gonna be straightforward right
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
so first one's up 354 and we do have an
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
amendment for it
 
00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:10.309 align:start position:0%
amendment for it
so

00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
anybody who cares does it get a have a
 
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
so where where you have them where you
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
was that was that the order to it
 
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
oh it got it got really uh well it's
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
hard to tell what was the original bill
 
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna take off my green man
 
00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.269 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna take off my green man
jacket

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
jacket
 
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
because i can't wear it till sunday
 
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.389 align:start position:0%
because i can't wear it till sunday
right

00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:52.800 --> 00:09:05.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
and i assume the department has got a
 
00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:10.230 align:start position:0%
and i assume the department has got a
copy

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.190 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:15.950 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.430 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
no i have two or four and i have two of
 
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.790 align:start position:0%
no i have two or four and i have two of
these

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
two four two six three fifty four six
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
two four so there's just the three right
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:00.389 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
where was the where was the word change
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
it was line six
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
his line it said per violation or any
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
combination or actions and i believe it
 
00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:16.839 align:start position:0%
was changed to of
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
actions yes
 
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
is right
 
00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.389 align:start position:0%
is right
there

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
yeah okay otherwise it looks good
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:51.030 align:start position:0%
okay
good

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
aren't you you're on the insurance yeah

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.630 align:start position:0%

all right so who would like to carry
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
this forward i think it's going to go on
 
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar who would like to
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
make the uh pass
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
um can i speak to something before we
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
make the recommendation
 
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
on behalf of connie's concerns okay i
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
we spoke a little bit about this
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday but she was concerned with
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 12
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
failing to comply with an administrative
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
or court order imposing child support
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
obligation okay she felt that it would
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
be covered in roman numeral eight
 
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.670 align:start position:0%
be covered in roman numeral eight
um

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
using fraudulent course over dishonest
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
practices but i think we had a
 
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:01.519 align:start position:0%
conversation john that maybe we just
 
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
speak to again about why this was um
 
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
singled out individually and what the
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
impact would be so there's a clear
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
understanding well my comment was that
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
as an employer
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
i learned one day that that the last
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
thing an employer wants to see is this
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
pink sheet from the irs
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
and that the infamous pink sheet means
 
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
that you have to that that actually i
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
don't have to do anything there the irs
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
is just going to come and take the money
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
out of my our corp our check account the
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
business account they're just going to
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
sweep it right out of the account
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
and and pay
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
for somebody who has not been doing
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
their child support payments so i'm
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
assuming that that's where this comes
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
from but did did you guys do any
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up on this
 
00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
the insurance department did you guys
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%

00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah that's 354.
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
right okay hi
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
yeah you have to push the button so
 
00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:45.519 align:start position:0%
chrissy can hear you good morning again
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
my name is joshua hillard i'm the
 
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
compliance and enforcement council of
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire insurance department
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
and to address your question not only is
 
00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
it reflective of 402j which has that
 
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
same language as to child support orders
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
as to insurance producers i understand
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
through conversation that there was a
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
concerted effort about 20 or 30 years
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
ago to make it that a lot of the
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
professional license in the state could
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
be impacted by not um being current with
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
child support so my understanding is
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
that's consistent across a number of the
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
professional licenses in the state
 
00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:16.790 align:start position:0%
professional licenses in the state
okay

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative greeson
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i see this the bill
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
is dealing with licensed denial
 
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
non-renewal or revocation and there
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
needs to be a good cause for doing so to
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
either deny a license to not renew a
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
license or to revoke a license
 
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.590 align:start position:0%
license or to revoke a license
and

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
good cause is being defined as we're
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
including this the several listed items
 
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
and failing to comply with an order to
 
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.030 align:start position:0%
and failing to comply with an order to
impose

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
impose
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
to pay child support shows a lack of
 
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
integrity in fulfilling one's financial
 
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
obligations and if you lack integrity in
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
in paying your financial obligations
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
then you are not going to be
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
responsible in other decisions
 
00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:00.870 align:start position:0%
responsible in other decisions
potentially

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
as it relates to your profession and
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
therefore a license uh
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
would it be reasonable to assume if
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
you're not responsible in that area and
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
fail to comply with those orders you're
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
probably likely to not comply with other
 
00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.590 align:start position:0%
probably likely to not comply with other
orders

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
orders
 
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
that's how i read it okay but what are
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
we still on the right bill number let's
 
00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:21.269 align:start position:0%
we still on the right bill number let's
see

00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
so this was
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
line that she was looking at yeah where
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
we have the right bill
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
that was the amendment to 354 that just
 
00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:35.350 align:start position:0%
that was the amendment to 354 that just
changed

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
okay so she's looking at the underlying
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
bill and this was the amendment okay
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
yeah the amount i thought we agreed the
 
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
amendment was fine it was just a change
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
of the underlying bill okay right this
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
is the underlying bill thank god okay mr
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
helping me to realize i wasn't the only
 
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
one who was confused confused i can be
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
confused well if you're confused it
 
00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
makes everything all right now
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
okay i have a question yes
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
would it be appropriate yes please sir
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.150 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
so

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
following on representative greeson's
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
question with respect to good cause um
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm concerned
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
with uh the phrase but is not limited to
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
so you have 12 items here
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
which are
 
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
reference points or measurements for
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
good cause
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
what are
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
the other good causes
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
are they enumerated anywhere or
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
is this merely a a judgment call on the
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
first on the part of the person making
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
the judgment
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a good question so to
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
to answer that
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
this bill was an effort to try to
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
enumerate that if you notice the statute
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
as it reads now does not define good
 
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.269 align:start position:0%
as it reads now does not define good
cause

00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
cause
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
so this provides those 12 enumerated
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
definitions which are mirrored in that
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
in 402j which is those reasons for which
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
we may bring an action against an
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
insurance producer an insurance agent
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
this is an insurance adjuster
 
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079 align:start position:0%
but as you identified the not limited to
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
language indicates there of course could
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
be other scenarios that might not fit
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
neatly into one of these 12
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
under which the department would wish to
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
bring an action against an insurance
 
00:17:15.039 --> 00:17:16.150 align:start position:0%
bring an action against an insurance
adjuster

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
adjuster
 
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
for conduct that would suggest they
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
should not be licensed and operating in
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:17:20.799 --> 00:17:22.309 align:start position:0%
the state
follow

00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
in which case if if that were the case
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
that there were other
 
00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:27.110 align:start position:0%
that there were other
cause

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
cause
 
00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.549 align:start position:0%
cause
causes

00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
causes
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
they would need to be identified and
 
00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:32.390 align:start position:0%
they would need to be identified and
defended

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
defended
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
but other than that which is in the
 
00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.510 align:start position:0%
but other than that which is in the
statute

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
so this the statute if if it's enacted
 
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
makes it firm all you'd have to do is
 
00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.669 align:start position:0%
makes it firm all you'd have to do is
refer

00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
refer
 
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
to one or more of these causes if in
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
fact you were bringing an action under
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
one or more of those causes if it's a
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
cause or causes not
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
i uh that has been added
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
if it to this to this law
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
then your burden would be a little
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
higher would you agree
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
if i understand your your question
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
appropriately if the compliance
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement council to convince the
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
hearing officer that if it fell outside
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
of that 12 that this still rose to
 
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
good cause to bring action correct great
 
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
once like spell it out for me and spell
 
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0%
it out but then the other day if they
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
if adopted these 12 items move the ball
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
way down the field because what i heard
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
in testimony is that there were no 12
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
items before just a good cause
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
this this gives a foundation
 
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
but there may it has indicated in the in
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
the uh on line nine there may be other
 
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.029 align:start position:0%
the uh on line nine there may be other
causes

00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:55.039 align:start position:0%
causes
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
but this is a vast improvement over the
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
fact that there was nothing before
 
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
excellent okay thank you representative
 
00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.350 align:start position:0%

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh moves uh ought to pass on the
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%

amendment then
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
you have demons yes good morning uh many
 
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
members i'm heather silverstein general
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
counsel of the insurance department uh
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
yes we reviewed this yesterday and um
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
this is the language that we would
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
recommended to the bill
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
um the guarantees association had
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
actually proposed making this little
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
tweak for the amendment and we agreed
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
with it just to further clarify
 
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.750 align:start position:0%
with it just to further clarify
um

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
that if you're a
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
member when the policy is issued then it
 
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
then even if that policy gets consumed
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
by another company
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
um it would still be covered later even
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
if that company insurance company was
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
okay so with respect to the change
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
what was in the original was non-member
 
00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.750 align:start position:0%
what was in the original was non-member
insurer

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
insurer
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh i don't recall that we
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
identified the issue was this something
 
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
that you all
 
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
looked at again and decided that you
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
wanted changed
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
or did we provide any wisdom on this for
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%

yeah no i i do have it but i mean that's
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
just like an index to help you find
 
00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.029 align:start position:0%
just like an index to help you find
things

00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%

00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
i do have a question about this one okay
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:54.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:58.710 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
relative to discount medical plan
 
00:33:00.559 --> 00:33:04.789 align:start position:0%
relative to discount medical plan
organizations

00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
okay did you say you had a common
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
question on that one um yes i do i
 
00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.350 align:start position:0%
question on that one um yes i do i
um

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if the subcommittee
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
would be open to having a discussion
 
00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
about um line 19
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
one of the requirements is of good
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
character which i find very ambiguous
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
and perhaps
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
needs to have a better definition and i
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
think maybe one of the things you
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know if everyone else has a
 
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
concern or if we would be open to
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
amending that to be a little bit more
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
specific because i find that to be very
 
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.669 align:start position:0%
specific because i find that to be very
subjective

00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%
so i would assume
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
that if someone was not a good character
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
the department would tell the person
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
what where they flunked
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
yes and if i can clarify if you look up
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
at um
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
lines five and six well that whole
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph starting at three lines three
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
through six
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
what this paragraph is stating is that
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
the application shall include or be
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
accompanied by the following information
 
00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
and documents so these are the types of
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
things that we would ask for more
 
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
information in the application and
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
that's where the background check would
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
come in in the application we could
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
require a background check but to
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
address your concerns about good
 
00:34:23.359 --> 00:34:24.470 align:start position:0%
address your concerns about good
character

00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
character
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
i did look into this a little bit
 
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.270 align:start position:0%
i did look into this a little bit
further

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
and in our tpa statute was which is the
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
third party administrator statute
 
00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:33.430 align:start position:0%
third party administrator statute
it

00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
instead of using the term good character
 
00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
it says is competent trustworthy
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
financially responsible
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
or of good personal or business
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
reputation so that provides a little bit
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
more parameters but it wouldn't just be
 
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
a background check because the
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
background check is only going to give
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
you certain information we also would
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
the people involved in running this type
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
of organization haven't had
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
you know administrative actions taken
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
against them before and that's the type
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
of thing that wouldn't necessarily come
 
00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
up on like a criminal background check
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
so we want it to be a little bit more
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
broader than just you know a criminal
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
yes i suppose i
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
like all of us we bring our backgrounds
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
and experiences with us and so i
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps have to apologize
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
but i'm still uncomfortable with leaving
 
00:35:29.839 --> 00:35:30.710 align:start position:0%
but i'm still uncomfortable with leaving
this

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
the way it is is of good character and
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
would appreciate it if we could add
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
something to the effect
 
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079 align:start position:0%
as per
 
00:35:38.079 --> 00:35:39.349 align:start position:0%
as per
uh

00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
such and such a section in the tpa
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
or we can add that that whole phrase
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
that she just
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
or add that language
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't i don't care whether you
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
reference the tpa section or whether you
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
put it in of course if you put it in
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
that means it is what it is and it can't
 
00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:57.670 align:start position:0%
that means it is what it is and it can't
it

00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
you'd have to change it by statute
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
whereas if you reference to the tpa and
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
the tpa
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
is changed it's still referencing to the
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
tpa in the future as change i don't know
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
do you have a druthers on that the tpa
 
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
language i was referencing is in the tpa
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
statute so it would be a statutory
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
change either way i think it would be
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
cleaner to just amend the language here
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
to mirror the language
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
so okay can we do that we can
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay is that
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
do i need to move that
 
00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
no because we don't have an amendment
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
we have to write it we have to write the
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
amendment okay and then we'll take that
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
i believe i have this scheduled
 
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
for next thursday is this another the
 
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would be rescheduled for
 
00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
for this one might i ask representative
 
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
fargos is this am i just carrying this a
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
little farther in are you no i feel
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
you're happy with this now
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
where this is going i think i have a
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
much better comfort level i think the
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
amendment would answer that question for
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
me and i could support the bill at that
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
point yes
 
00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
so could you make sure you said
 
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
yeah christine the uh the language yes
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
okay you got her you got her email now
 
00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:15.990 align:start position:0%
right okay
yeah

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
okay and then just as a follow-up from
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday i want to clarify to do my
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
homework for you we do have 26
 
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.349 align:start position:0%
homework for you we do have 26
registered

00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
registered
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
discount medical plans and they're
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
primarily offering prescription drug
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
discounts and dental services as well
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
and dental and we also want to clarify
 
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:32.950 align:start position:0%
and dental and we also want to clarify
that

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
these discount medical plans do not
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
include coupons for drugs there is a
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
distinction there so discount medical
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
plans the definition of them does not
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
include providers that give discounts on
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
their own products and services
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
so right i remember we had a build not
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
too long ago that we were going to ban
 
00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.470 align:start position:0%
too long ago that we were going to ban
coupons

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
coupons
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
and i think i was
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
but fortunately
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
that never happened
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay you refresh my memory
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
is was this is this all new or did we
 
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
no we already have it you already have
 
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
so what were we changing here we're just
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
changing the um registration
 
00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.589 align:start position:0%
changing the um registration
requirements

00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
there was no actual registration there
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
there was no action because they were
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
doing it they were doing it in thank you
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
they were required to register there
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
just weren't any requirements for what
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
that registration
 
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
you're putting some meat on the bones
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
for the registration yes and it mirrors
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
what's in the naic model
 
00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:39.030 align:start position:0%
what's in the naic model
right

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:47.270 align:start position:0%
 
needs

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:47.280 --> 00:39:00.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
what's next uh
 
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.470 align:start position:0%
what's next uh
121.

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
121.
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
the afternoon
 
00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:31.430 align:start position:0%
the afternoon
okay

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
one pager
 
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.190 align:start position:0%
one pager
yeah

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:53.920 --> 00:40:02.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
all right uh can you have a copy i can
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
okay so this is another one of my name
 
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
is on it
 
00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:39.270 align:start position:0%
is on it
okay

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
i think we all pretty much generally
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
agree we would not like the idea that
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
this happens without legislative right
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
input i agree
 
00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
right everybody yes in addition to the
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
fact that i believe this was the the
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
bill where tyler
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
indicated that there would need to be a
 
00:40:56.079 --> 00:40:57.589 align:start position:0%
indicated that there would need to be a
50

00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
50
 
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
give or take increase in staffing or
 
00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.670 align:start position:0%
give or take increase in staffing or
budget

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
so this goes this on two counts i think
 
00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.230 align:start position:0%
so this goes this on two counts i think
this

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
goes uh back to for work
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
i was just trying to give a kind of a
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
comparison of the really the investment
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
the state would be doing when they if
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
they were to move forward with a
 
00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
state-based exchange and that when you
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
look at if you ask the insurance
 
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
department to do that even at the low
 
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
cost of a kind of an implement
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
state-based implementation that would be
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
like a 50 increase in the insurance
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
department's budget but to the extent
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
that we as a state are spending money on
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
the exchange services
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
that's not an increase i mean hopefully
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day we're saving money
 
00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.109 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day we're saving money
right

00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
right but for the department
 
00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:42.390 align:start position:0%
right but for the department
so

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
i mean i i guess when you try to think
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
about you know why you know how eight
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
well i could say is the institutional
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge how why we got where we were
 
00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
and it was at that time when this was
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
first occurring was
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
um we were totally fearful of
 
00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
of the software you know starting having
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
a nightmare good reason and i would say
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
then going forward when the last time
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
we were kind of discussing this issue
 
00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.190 align:start position:0%
we were kind of discussing this issue
that

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the federal versus state
 
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
the issue was okay we could save money
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
but that but we're
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
we're somewhat vulnerable to a private
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
company maybe charging more fees not
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
like as i said on my county delegation
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
the one thing that drives us nuts is
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
that we upgrade our software and then
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
they keep sending us you know every year
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
we have to do the licensure and
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
licensing and the fees just they always
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
get higher right
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
and then but then i heard that for the
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
first time out of out of the blue and
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
that the federal government actually
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
reduced its fee
 
00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.230 align:start position:0%
reduced its fee
right

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
it actually reduced its fee so so so
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
that that gives you a nice right
 
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
were they increasing
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
did they didn't they decreased it and
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
then increased it uh it had been it so
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
it started low it had increased up to
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
about three and a half percent i think
 
00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.150 align:start position:0%
about three and a half percent i think
yeah

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
and then they don't so
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
then under uh trump administration
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
dropped uh to the point where it's going
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
to be two and a quarter right now it's
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
increased back to two and a half and
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's almost time for them to announce
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
what next year's rate is going to be we
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
don't know right okay so theirs is
 
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
variable as well there's variable too
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
right so i would say
 
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
so one issue that where i was involved
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
in terms of the oversight committee
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
which i guess used to be
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
oversight over this and just so
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
everybody knows what that oversight
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
committee that was created by um the
 
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
former representative
 
00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:41.750 align:start position:0%
former representative
manos

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
manos
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
and his theory was that we didn't want
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
departments applying for waivers without
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
first having the legislature say whether
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
we think it's a good idea or not but
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
because the legislature can't always be
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
in session
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
that it was then to this this committee
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
this mother may i committee was that hhs
 
00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
or the insurance department had to go to
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
this committee and get approval before
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
they can submit a waiver
 
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
request so that i guess the issue for me
 
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:10.870 align:start position:0%
request so that i guess the issue for me
was

00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:13.589 align:start position:0%
was
that

00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.599 --> 00:44:15.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
it's always the balancing of you know
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
where we stand as the state do we you
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
know where we are the affordable care
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
act obviously we were there before
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
but this key element of the affordable
 
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
care act that really did change
 
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
was that the federal government was
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
going to subsidize individuals
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
and give them a discount you know give
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
them that subsidy and the question i was
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
always worried it was always in back of
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
my mind
 
00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:39.829 align:start position:0%
my mind
is

00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
the vulnerability of the state
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
of uh we're we're
 
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
have this program we have it set up
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
someone goes in and doesn't get it or
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
the federal government or some somehow
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
the the discount they didn't get their
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
discounted savings or something now the
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
state has to act as a advocate for that
 
00:44:58.079 --> 00:44:59.750 align:start position:0%
state has to act as a advocate for that
citizen

00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
citizen
 
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
against the federal model the federal
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
you know giving that rebate i mean you
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
follow where i'm going with this
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
that what do we call that discount what
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
do we call that
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
advanced premium tax credit it's
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
advanced premium tax credit okay
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
which is theoretically has to be
 
00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
approved by a federal agency
 
00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.670 align:start position:0%
approved by a federal agency
right

00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
can the state just say we're going to
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
give them this this advance without
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
having you know at some point in time
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
the federal government has to say yes or
 
00:45:29.359 --> 00:45:30.230 align:start position:0%
the federal government has to say yes or
no

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
that whatever we put it whatever the
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
software you got
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
who says this is what they're eligible
 
00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:36.550 align:start position:0%
who says this is what they're eligible
for

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
it does get turned up with your taxes so
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
that's one of the complexities of the
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
connection with irs
 
00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:43.839 align:start position:0%
yeah it's um so it is what it is
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
advanced premium tax credit you estimate
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
your your income for the year either too
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
high or too low
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
then that advanced premium tax credit
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be accurate at the end of the
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
year you have to sell through so you get
 
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
like a 1099 or maybe some we gotta you
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
get a tax form on this
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
and then and then you just have to hope
 
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
that when you whatever withholdings you
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
had from
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
with your employer when you filled out
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
your w
 
00:46:10.079 --> 00:46:11.990 align:start position:0%
your w
poor

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
poor
 
00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying that
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
withholding whether you're holding right
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
or not and then then you might have to
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
pay more or you gotta you get us get a
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
check back with you yeah i would say
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
that's a good way to think of your
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
advanced premium taxes it's a little
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
like you're withholding from your
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
paycheck you hope you're estimating
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
everything right but at the end of the
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
year when you file taxes you still may
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
need to make an adjustment
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
so if it was a state model versus a
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
federal model is that any different is
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
that still the same
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
so it's still the same and the state's
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
not in the middle of that the the
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
negotiation the
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
determination of the eligibility
 
00:46:48.319 --> 00:46:49.270 align:start position:0%
determination of the eligibility
uh

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
for the consumer for the citizen
 
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
of that tax credit is happening in the
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
technology system
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
so whether the technology system is the
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
federal system or the state-run system
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
that eligibility determination is
 
00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.230 align:start position:0%
that eligibility determination is
happening

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
negotiation and the transfer of those
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
premium tax credits is happening between
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
the federal government and the insurance
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
carrier uh so it's happening behind the
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
scenes and the consumer
 
00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:24.559 align:start position:0%
the individual taxpayer
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
and the individual uh
 
00:47:27.839 --> 00:47:28.950 align:start position:0%
and the individual uh
insured

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
insured
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh individual
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
is not involved and the state is not
 
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
involved so
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be we're not in the middle
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
to your concern in terms of what i guess
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
my concern is software handling it
 
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
properly software inherently but
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
come to the mic okay so yes why don't
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
you guys come up
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
well it might be the three of you
 
00:47:55.349 --> 00:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
already i don't know yeah all three of
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
you needs to get out of here right
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
it sounds like there are a number of
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
of uh of issues that fall out under this
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
question correct which suggests to me
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
that we're not quite ready yet for prime
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
time we might not want to and we're not
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable doing it this this way but i
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
might say philosophically
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
in addition to the fact that i don't
 
00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
think it makes a whole lot of sense for
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
us to go back and
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
and and argue
 
00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:27.430 align:start position:0%
and and argue
um

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
what was argued back in 2010
 
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.349 align:start position:0%
what was argued back in 2010
um

00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.359 --> 00:48:34.950 align:start position:0%
 
insurance

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
historically has been
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
come under the
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
powers that are reserved to the states
 
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
not delegated to the federal government
 
00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:43.750 align:start position:0%
not delegated to the federal government
but

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
we're already down this road and we
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
basically have a federal model now for
 
00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
at least part of of the insurance
 
00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.390 align:start position:0%
at least part of of the insurance
universe

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
universe
 
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
so but but the option is is is given for
 
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.349 align:start position:0%
so but but the option is is is given for
states

00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
to to run their own um
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
which what was the right word here
 
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
exchange exchanges yes
 
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.150 align:start position:0%
exchange exchanges yes
um

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
the other item i think that that's
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
that's very
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
troublesome here is that
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
this bill is a signing the potential
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
studying the
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
the potential benefits of implementing a
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
state-based exchange to the insurance
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
department and we've already heard from
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
the insurance department that this would
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
be a real onerous burden upon them
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
in terms of time and and personnel and
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
and cost
 
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
so i i don't think this is a bad idea
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
and i actually like the idea of states
 
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
running exchanges
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
philosophically but i don't think we're
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
ready yet to do this
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
but again yeah so the the insurance
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
department would have to do the grunt
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
work if we put this to study
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
any way if we assign them the work of
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
doing this stuff who else would do who
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
else well that's a good question and
 
00:49:56.549 --> 00:49:56.559 align:start position:0%
what did the other states do
 
00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
did the other states assign their state
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
insurance departments to do this is
 
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
anybody can anybody answer that right
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
tyler's well first i'd comment that yeah
 
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
it would be it would be quite involved
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
for the insurance department to take the
 
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
lead on this and more likely than not we
 
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
would hire a contractor to assist the
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
state in doing it and we do have funds
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
in our budget but i think for an
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
investment like this this would be a
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
line item in our budget that would have
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
to show up separately in order for us to
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
really dedicate the resources necessary
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
but you're talking about a sort of very
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
involved process with a lot of
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and i can't underestimate
 
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
sort of dhhs's involvement in this
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
because of the medicaid program and the
 
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
tie to it but but interest will come out
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
i think on a number of different levels
 
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
and while we can act as a coordinator i
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
think beyond the resource concern is is
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
really sort of the insurance department
 
00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
um weighing in with an opinion about
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
whether or not the state should move
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
forward that's uh that part we believe
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
that part we don't think you should no
 
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't be involved yeah but
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
that's the policy part that i think we
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
all agree
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
that you know that's that's our our job
 
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
to decide whether we should do it or not
 
00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
so that gets down to uh
 
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
there are two ways to follow to study
 
00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:01.829 align:start position:0%
there are two ways to follow to study
this

00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
my father so tyler do you know how other
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
states have handled this same question
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
at the at the at the at the
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
origin at the beginning pro of the
 
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
procedure i know there are small states
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
that that implemented
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh state exchanges
 
00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.230 align:start position:0%
uh state exchanges
um

00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
i came from rhode island
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
a number of years ago where rhode island
 
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
implemented a state exchange and had a
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
at the very get-go and had a lot of
 
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
problems a lot of problems
 
00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:33.750 align:start position:0%
problems a lot of problems
um

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know how they did that but i'm
 
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
thinking in terms of state budgets
 
00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
what's available and
 
00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
i would think comparably we're looking
 
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
at resources that
 
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
that are similar on a state level when
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
we look at new hampshire and rhode
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
island as opposed to new york or
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
california so can you answer
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
insurance regulation is structured
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
differently by state often it's combined
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
with different organizations new
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire being a smaller state
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
we're not we don't have some of the
 
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
entities that might exist in another
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
state i think health policy commissions
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
even in vermont you've got a green
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
mountain care board
 
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
so i think to the extent that a
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility like this would be
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
assigned to a particular entity it'd be
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
i'm not familiar with another state
 
00:52:17.109 --> 00:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
insurance department being the lead
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps as an example like that but i
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
think more likely you're you're sort of
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
investing at the state level and kind of
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
an entity that's going to take the lead
 
00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
on this and pull together all the
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
interested stakeholders um you may have
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
additional insight about how states sort
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
of move the forward process sure tyler i
 
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
would just add
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
i think idaho might be a good example
 
00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
um idaho established a state-based
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
exchange um that they call your health
 
00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:42.710 align:start position:0%
exchange um that they call your health
idaho

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
idaho
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
and they established that as a
 
00:52:48.309 --> 00:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
stand-alone entity inside of the idaho
 
00:52:48.319 --> 00:52:49.349 align:start position:0%
stand-alone entity inside of the idaho
government

00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
um i i
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
you know we could be happy to share
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
additional information with you
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's also of course all available online
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
but as you think about studying this
 
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
whoever's performing that study
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
i think the one
 
00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
piece of advice that i would suggest is
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
speaking to
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
other states that have gone through this
 
00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:11.829 align:start position:0%
other states that have gone through this
transition

00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
transition
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
because they've got that
 
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
naturally they have the expertise they
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
have the wisdom they have the experience
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
they can tell you what went well they
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
can tell you what didn't go well
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
they can weigh in on pitfalls things to
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
be on the lookout for
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
but idaho would be a good i think a good
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
sort of comparable
 
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh model i don't have a lot of insight
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
into how they handled it from a budget
 
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
standpoint uh but they would be a a
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
comparable a comparably sized state from
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
an exchange standpoint
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
my perception here is that this idea is
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
not running into a stone wall
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you john
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
he's nodding his head sir yeah so so uh
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
i might ask a question of tyler then
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
to to do the kind of
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh checking at the 4 000 foot level
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
rather than at the at the ground level
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
on the way that other states
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
have gone about
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh proceeding with the state exchange
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
would that involve the same type of
 
00:54:13.829 --> 00:54:13.839 align:start position:0%
process that you outlined before if you
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
were given full responsibility or would
 
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
this be a little bit easier and more
 
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
manageable and you could do it with the
 
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
resources that you have
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
i think if you're just doing if you're
 
00:54:23.829 --> 00:54:23.839 align:start position:0%
asking basically just for an analysis of
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
how other states proceeded forward and
 
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
did the planning that's within the scope
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
of existing resources the report i gave
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
you the cover page in the executive
 
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
summary to yesterday and sent the link
 
00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:35.839 align:start position:0%
around that was about a 15 000
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
expenditure for the department to have
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
them do basically a quick assessment of
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
the risks and opportunities and look a
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
little bit what other states did
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
mr chair do we have to make a formal
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
request or is this kind of like a person
 
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
to person
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
you to somebody or how do we do this i
 
00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
guess it's it's we have to deal with the
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that's in front of us sure
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay so if we just interim study this
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
yes we could certainly ask the
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
department to do that yes okay
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
but key
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing is the fiscal note
 
00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:11.190 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing is the fiscal note
implication

00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
implication
 
00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:11.990 align:start position:0%
implication
okay

00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:13.839 align:start position:0%
because theoretically
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
that uh anything they do
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
you know and they're going to want to
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
really to do it right you really need to
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
hire that outside consultant
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
okay and then anything they do
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
um how you know do we need do we need to
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
actually turn this bill into having an
 
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the department to
 
00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:32.839 align:start position:0%
do this
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
analysis or uh you know so that's that's
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
where i guess we're um and then
 
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
obviously the issue was the way this
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
bill was written was to full steam ahead
 
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
yes okay which means that we are
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
agreeing to it which i think that pretty
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
much we're not we're not there yet but
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
you're saying if we want to interim
 
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
study this so that this kind of an
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
analysis can be done we have to make it
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
into a fiscal interim study
 
00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
all the interim study is going to get to
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
is at the end of the day the interim
 
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
study is do we
 
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
do we go forward with some legislation
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
and then maybe draw up a potential it
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
used to be
 
00:56:12.079 --> 00:56:13.990 align:start position:0%
used to be
um

00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
go forward with a future men
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
as amended but i think they got rid of
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
that i think now we just have either go
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
forward or we don't go forward
 
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's the that's the motion of
 
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
anything that goes into rhythm study so
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
that the question is
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
if we're if we
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
that would be the least that would be uh
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
i guess the least impactful in terms of
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
certainly for us us to figure out how we
 
00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
are with this at this moment otherwise
 
00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
do we want to amend this bill
 
00:56:45.359 --> 00:56:46.230 align:start position:0%
do we want to amend this bill
to

00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.270 align:start position:0%
to
say

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
um to give the department money you know
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
amend the bill with an appropriation you
 
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
know or charge the the department with
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
going forward to doing that analysis
 
00:57:02.069 --> 00:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh and creating potential legislation
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
so that the department will have
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
something have they get some work done
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
they'll have it and then we would then
 
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
see it come
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
january thank you um yes thank you i i
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
have some other concerns i mean i i
 
00:57:18.549 --> 00:57:18.559 align:start position:0%
totally support where we're going with
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
this it's not ready for prime time in my
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
opinion um the question about interim
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
do this study within the time frame that
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
that we have left
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
um because we're at the end of a term so
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about that but i think
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's also some ambiguity in what
 
00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
what we want out of the study it's not
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
just a software implementation there are
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
issues i think that need to be defined
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
like if we are going to have a cost
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
savings where will that money go
 
00:57:56.549 --> 00:57:56.559 align:start position:0%
i mean they give you ideas like oh it
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
could go to general fund or it could go
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
here or there but i
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
really feel that before we could agree
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
to move forward we would have to define
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
where that savings would would go and
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
how it would be used and i
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
personally would like to see that it
 
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
somehow goes to reducing premiums or
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
benefiting the consumer and none of that
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
is here this is a i heard the word
 
00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
flexible and nimble and to me that was
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
like a red light going on because this
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
is just giving way too much
 
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know power to
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
to for decisions to be made that we're
 
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
not ready to make so
 
00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
i'm i i have some serious concerns with
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
this bill in general so so you're you're
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
i would agree to moving
 
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
to to modifying it or amending it to
 
00:58:56.069 --> 00:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
make it a study if
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
i'd be okay with with tyler going ahead
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
to do the analysis
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
but that that's all i would feel
 
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable with and i can't really
 
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
speak for the rest of
 
00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:12.630 align:start position:0%
speak for the rest of
you

00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
my concern is is again the resources
 
00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839 align:start position:0%
that tyler talked about in terms of of
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
doing that so
 
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative griezmann
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
i think representative fargo nailed it
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
on the head i'm i i can't shake my head
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh in the affirmative of what she
 
00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
just said anymore um
 
00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
i i like the idea of
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
getting a little bit more information of
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
how we go from what we have now
 
00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
to a state exchange philosophically i'm
 
00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:48.799 align:start position:0%
on board with that
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
but there's got to be a whole lot more
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
nuts and bolts in this before i would
 
00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
there has to be separate legislation to
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
give the go-ahead i think we need to
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
define a little bit more clearly where
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
the savings are going to actually go and
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
it needs to go back to the people
 
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
because that's where the money came from
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
and uh so i i wrote on this little chart
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
not to be disrespective but uh
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
disrespectful but when he has on your
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
combining savings with federal matching
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
funds to support the existing
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
reinsurance program that's pie in the
 
01:00:15.599 --> 01:00:17.109 align:start position:0%
reinsurance program that's pie in the
sky

01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
sky
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's sales pitch
 
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
and and you know to save four million
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
dollars a year is six dollars and sixty
 
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
six cents per month per enrollee and i
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
don't know is that i mean that sounds
 
01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
great four million dollars a year but uh
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
you know this is also not a time share
 
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
program uh and so when we get to the
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs what data is being
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
collected by whom and for what purposes
 
01:00:42.309 --> 01:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
so there are just way too many questions
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have to answer to me
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
before i would ever go forward with
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
implementing it but i'm certainly not
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to doing it
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
if we get the answers right so how do we
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
do it how do we do it how do we do this
 
01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.670 align:start position:0%
do it how do we do it how do we do this
well

01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's how how far do you want to go help
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
how far down we want to go i mean in
 
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
do we want to keep put
 
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
re changing this bill and writing all
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
that stuff in it or just interim study
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
it and let let us figure that out come
 
01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.309 align:start position:0%
it and let let us figure that out come
september

01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
i i like this bill as it is written
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
no way
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
that's what needs to be interim studied
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
okay it needs rewards interim study
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
would work for me we can get the right
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
answers and then we come up with
 
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
something if we get the right answers
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
yes okay but
 
01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
this this is bigger than a bread box
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
interim study we don't have a lot of
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
time too well interim study would we you
 
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
know we have that month and a half
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
so what we would be doing in that month
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
and a half that's just revising this
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps a study
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
is well i it could end up coming out
 
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
that way but that it would have in it an
 
01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.990 align:start position:0%
that way but that it would have in it an
appropriation

01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
for the department to do its analysis
 
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
work i think we're identifying specific
 
01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
areas that we want addressed so i don't
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
think that that would take a lot of time
 
01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.230 align:start position:0%
think that that would take a lot of time
okay

01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
i i think this could be i hope i'm not
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
being overly optimistic or unrealistic
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
here but i don't think that would really
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
take a lot of time because we know what
 
01:02:07.109 --> 01:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about we know what we
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
want answers for we just da da da da da
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
we're done we can always make a
 
01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
determination in interim study that we
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to move forward with this and
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
as well and save that and recommend it
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
for future and kill it so i before we
 
01:02:23.029 --> 01:02:23.039 align:start position:0%
just walked away i do want to offer up
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:25.829 align:start position:0%
that um
that

01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:25.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:25.839 --> 01:02:26.710 align:start position:0%
that
former

01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
former
 
01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:27.750 align:start position:0%
former
senator

01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
senator
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
bragdon did point out and that what you
 
01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
were reading there just that it was a
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
sort of a bone to me
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
and that was that um i was the uh one of
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
the negative votes
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
on the fact that we assessed everyone's
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
insurance everyone who had insurance for
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
all of us you know what they all the
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
fully insured
 
01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.349 align:start position:0%
fully insured
because

01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
we all got assessed
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh and therefore we pay i don't know
 
01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
couple dollars
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
a year i guess or a month
 
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so 250 that that turns into
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
like 30 bucks a year
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
so that we all all make a contribution
 
01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
of 30 a year to help subsidize this
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
market so what he was appealing to me
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
was the savings would be to
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh either repeal that or
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
lower that dollar amount so that all of
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
us who are being taxed
 
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
to help subsidize this that we would get
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
the relief so i would just say in that
 
01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:29.510 align:start position:0%
the relief so i would just say in that
case

01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
you're spelling out where was the
 
01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
savings coming from that was spelled out
 
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
correct and so that it sounds like that
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
would probably be maybe stuck into
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
our recommendation uh come september
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
when we make it so
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
would it be appropriate to move to
 
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
interim study i think we've got enough
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
good heads to do this i'm making a
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
speech now but
 
01:03:49.599 --> 01:03:52.230 align:start position:0%
speech now but
um

01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.069 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:03:54.069 --> 01:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
secondly representative greeson
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
01:04:01.599 --> 01:04:02.870 align:start position:0%
interim study
okay

01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
did he just
 
01:04:08.549 --> 01:04:08.559 align:start position:0%
yes yes your this is your last chance to
 
01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
convince us not to do that no no not
 
01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
trying to commit to a process question
 
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to remember exactly how
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
interim study works so uh the interim
 
01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
study comes back with a report of we
 
01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
urge uh we recommend pursuing this in
 
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
the subsequent year or we recommend not
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
doing it exactly and then when does that
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
interim study report have to come out
 
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
interim study has to end happen at the
 
01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
end of october it's like november 1st or
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
something like that so there's nothing
 
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
that says people can't get together
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
between now and then and work on it
 
01:04:37.589 --> 01:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
early if they anybody can work on it now
 
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
you know obviously obviously you know i
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
i would highly recommend you start
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
working on something so that by the time
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
we get to uh interim study next
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
september you've got something that you
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
would hope that we all can
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
right and plus not only the report
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
saying we should hopefully from our
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
perspective do something like this then
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
there's also the work on a bill to do it
 
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
which would have to be filed well so
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
we're we're
 
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
yeah but see we would say is uh again
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
you might be jumping the gun
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
that we would say is what you want to do
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
is uh is still going to be
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
spending the money that you need to have
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
an appropriation in it
 
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
for the department for the department to
 
01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
hire its consultant to figure out what
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
this is going to cost and guarantee us
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
that we'll get savings over the future
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
right they got to they got to you know
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
give us the the risk analysis of how far
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
you know whether this really is
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
real or not
 
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
and give us the risk of you know what's
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
been but that whatever that all that
 
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
analysis work
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
actually to me is then wouldn't be able
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
to go into effect until after
 
01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
we introduced this bill in january that
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
would have the appropriations so yes
 
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
we're definitely pushing everything off
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
a year here okay because in that bill it
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
would then have the appropriation it
 
01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
would have where the money's going to go
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do you know what's
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
what's you know and and so then that
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
gets signed it gets put in the budget
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
for next year
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
assuming that we you know that they come
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
the the department gets everything done
 
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
you know some through 2023 you know
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
through the so the fall of 2023
 
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
so that means come
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
no new legislation would actually come
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
in to actually implement it if it were
 
01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
would be january of 2024.
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
and i want to make sure i understand
 
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
giant 2024 would be beginning of the
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
bill that would actually got it get the
 
01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
us to buy into
 
01:06:38.559 --> 01:06:39.990 align:start position:0%
us to buy into
so

01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
with that point we'll have a fiscal note
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
that says what the what this is really
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
going to do the bill for 2023
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
is an appropriation of the department
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation and guidelines about what
 
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to do and what are our
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
expectations about doing this
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
because they have a small appropriation
 
01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
now that could do a few little things
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
but to do the big thing we need a lot
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
more in a specific lineup
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
and also the guidelines from us from
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
wanting whether we're you know and then
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
and then we have then you have the
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
legislature a body and we're happy to
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
provide any assistance or resources you
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
might need on that is that everybody so
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
are we feeling are you feeling are you
 
01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
all feeling comfortable
 
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
with the uh the areas that we've
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
identified as areas of concern for us so
 
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
that you don't walk out of here and and
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
say i don't really know what they were
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
talking about oh no i think those are
 
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
all legitimate concerns and questions
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
that uh come up i'm sure often in other
 
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
states as well okay and uh yeah and you
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
know maybe others but those were pretty
 
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
clear okay i think tyler just started
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
the countdown to win his retirement
 
01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.789 align:start position:0%
the countdown to win his retirement
start

01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
start
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
now he can't retire we've already lost
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
too many people in in the insurance
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
department we can't have him retired too
 
01:07:43.839 --> 01:07:44.950 align:start position:0%
department we can't have him retired too
soon

01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
soon
 
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
the other comment that i might make with
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
respect we can't predict who's going to
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
be here
 
01:07:51.029 --> 01:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
a year or two from now
 
01:07:51.039 --> 01:07:52.390 align:start position:0%
a year or two from now
but

01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
what you're hearing is
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
interest on both sides
 
01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
yes so that ought to provide you with
 
01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
some degree of encouragement that you're
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
not going to go on a fool's errand in
 
01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:03.990 align:start position:0%
not going to go on a fool's errand in
case

01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature flips to the one thing
 
01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
i've been we've been very impressed by
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
is the bipartisan support for the
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
concept right the details the hammer out
 
01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
but the concept i've been very impressed
 
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
by the and you see your sponsor list is
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
so the motion is uh in room study is the
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
motion clear all those in favor raise
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
one two three four five
 
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.030 align:start position:0%
one two three four five
okay

01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:37.669 align:start position:0%
 
beautiful

01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:49.839 --> 01:08:54.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:07.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.199 --> 01:09:08.789 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:09:08.799 --> 01:09:15.110 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
what what are people thinking about this
 
01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
bill i mean we got a lot of negative
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
letters but that doesn't necessarily
 
01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.870 align:start position:0%
letters but that doesn't necessarily
mean

01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.789 --> 01:09:26.799 align:start position:0%
too much other than some people
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
found out that they can send emails to
 
01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
us legislators
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
so you have a representative burroughs
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
you have a yeah i know that this bill is
 
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
likely going to go down in here but i
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
will just say that um i do think that
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
this sets an important precedent um
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
whether covet comes back or some some
 
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
other similar
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
we get some other similar virus in the
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
future i think it's important that
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
insurance companies be able to provide
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
these incentives like we talked about
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
the wellness incentives for going to a
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
gym or whatnot and um i think this will
 
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
keep our
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
our insurance costs lower for everyone
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
and ensures that we have more beds in
 
01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
our hospitals when such a pandemic takes
 
01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:08.709 align:start position:0%
our hospitals when such a pandemic takes
place

01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
right so and i and i was you know
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
thinking about that too because i that's
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
i kept saying you know the health you
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
know this um the gym gym thing and so
 
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
evidently we do have something in our
 
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
statute now about these wellness
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
yes you need to turn the mic on
 
01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.709 align:start position:0%
yes you need to turn the mic on
tyler

01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
tyler
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
yeah the right so wellness programs are
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
committed most of the guidance is
 
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
federal um and uh but it is an
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity as as long as it's not
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
discriminatory that
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
carriers can embrace sort of a wellness
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
type program that um encourages you to
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
do something and hopefully ends up with
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
lower costs
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
so the feds are the ones who really to
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
blame for making this a fuzzy issue
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
is that correct um i wouldn't put too
 
01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
much blame on them i think it does come
 
01:10:58.709 --> 01:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
back to just sort of the fundamental way
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
the way insurance works and um and with
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
all the particularly since the aca
 
01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
passed protections around pre-existing
 
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
conditions protections around sort of
 
01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
consideration of health factors and
 
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
nobody really seems to want to see a
 
01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
wellness program that really is based on
 
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
how healthy you are not what you're
 
01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:17.350 align:start position:0%
how healthy you are not what you're
doing

01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
so that's um that would be the concern
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
about uh sort of any type of new vaccine
 
01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:23.110 align:start position:0%
about uh sort of any type of new vaccine
or

01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
incentive type arrangement that's tied
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
to it i mean is that a health factor or
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
is it something the person did
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
and if it's something they did it's
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
wellness if it's something that reflects
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
their health status that's more like a
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
health factor and prohibited
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
and that's something the legislature
 
01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:38.790 align:start position:0%
and that's something the legislature
should

01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
decide we should sort that out uh you
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
know try not to provide kind of an
 
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
opinion around what the legislature
 
01:11:47.189 --> 01:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
should and shouldn't do but no i'm
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
saying i'm saying
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
is it at the end of the day is that
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
something that we really you know that
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
well they say we need to do it is that
 
01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
it is appropriate for the legislature to
 
01:11:59.189 --> 01:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
to referee this
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm and i'm saying thinking about
 
01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
what representative rogers has said is
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
what happens going forward okay good you
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
know yeah it's you know that because i i
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
hear that that there will be another
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
coveted pandemic probably within the
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
next 10 years so we how do we do
 
01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
preventive legislation now so that when
 
01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
that occurs that we don't have this
 
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
issue again yeah i think that
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
legislation like this does send the
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
message that
 
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
a wellness program is structured like
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
this is acceptable to the new hampshire
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
legislature so um
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
i think that uh you know the
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
department's in a place where we're
 
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
looking at that federal guidance we're
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
looking at potentially discriminatory
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
practices but i think if a program like
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
this today was developed
 
01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
we would not be in a position to object
 
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
to it i'm not sure how much interest
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
there is from the carriers at the moment
 
01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
but then again this is a potentially
 
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
competitive area if there is a carry
 
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
that wants to offer this to clients
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
wants the clarification and they're the
 
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
only one they may not want to actually
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
make that public
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
um i mean this you know you're kind of
 
01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:01.510 align:start position:0%
um i mean this you know you're kind of
um

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
how about the exchange i mean the the
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
marketplace i was thinking we're
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to call it the marketplace yeah
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
isn't the is the marketplace included
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
because that's federally
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
right so remember what i said about
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
wellness programs in general they're
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
they're they're permissible for the
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
group market but most of the time we're
 
01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
talking about the exchange we're talking
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
about the individual market right you
 
01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
kind of get your small employer coverage
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
there so it's
 
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
i think we're it's a different
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
definitely a different set of issues so
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
would it qualify for the individual
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
market no you would not be able to do a
 
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
wellness program like this for the
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
individual market um or a wellness
 
01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
program more generally
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
so that's this that is what i hate more
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
than anything else if we go past
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
something and then and then find out
 
01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
there's a big chunk of people who can't
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
take advantage of it and then and then
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
we'll get the letters saying why can't
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
we right
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
so representative burroughs i'll just
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
say one thing and and i'm prejudiced
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
because i i will say this i'm married to
 
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
a health care consultant
 
01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:55.430 align:start position:0%
a health care consultant
who

01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
talked to about this and our system is
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
based on a sickness model rather than a
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
wellness one and we're 30 i think it's
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
37th in the world in terms of our life
 
01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
expectancy and our health institutions
 
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
make more money when we're sick rather
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
than doing preventative care and i think
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
that this
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
i think that this really falls into that
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
and i really think um um that we need to
 
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
switch over to the wellness model and
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
there's there's so many things that
 
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
hospitals and local health care centers
 
01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
um i i agree i want to be clear this
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
isn't the mandate this is
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
they may do it it's voluntary it's not
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
telling anyone you have to it's just
 
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
giving people
 
01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
an incentive and i heard representative
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
van houghton yesterday if we saved one
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
life because someone got the vaccine
 
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of this then
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing so
 
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
i don't have a problem with this bill
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to support it
 
01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:59.189 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to support it
okay

01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
um i think
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
it in my mind it's uh appropriate to
 
01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
interim study it so that we can least
 
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
look at this wellness
 
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.189 align:start position:0%
look at this wellness
concept

01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
concept
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
and and not just as vaccines
 
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
but in overall
 
01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:17.590 align:start position:0%
but in overall
wellness

01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
so you had your hand up and yes you
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to say so
 
01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:23.270 align:start position:0%
wanted to say so
question

01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
each flu season i receive an incentive
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
from my
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
insurance company which is now medicare
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
to go and get a flu shot because and
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
they're free what's the incentive to get
 
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
the incentive is that i don't have to
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
pay for it and i'm supposed to be
 
01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:38.390 align:start position:0%
pay for it and i'm supposed to be
preventing

01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
preventing
 
01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
getting the flu
 
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
and they're not going to charge me for
 
01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
it so were co did people pay for their
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
covet shots
 
01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:45.990 align:start position:0%
covet shots
well

01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.189 align:start position:0%
well
uh

01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
so if you don't want to get sick
 
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
and you don't have to pay for something
 
01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
to my mind that's that's incentive
 
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
enough without having to offer people
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
another fifty dollars
 
01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:58.229 align:start position:0%
another fifty dollars
um

01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
i've already gotten in trouble once this
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
week for speaking my mind so i'm just
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
going to be very diplomatic and say
 
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh i i think we we have sufficient
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
incentives already
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh for people to do what they would
 
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
choose to do
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
because um what i've just heard is you
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
have to pay for it anyway so thank you
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
oh where to begin on this one
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
okay representative griezmann makes a
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
motion people need to legislate this
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
let's cut to the church no no this is
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
itl that's what i said people speak to
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
legislation oh i'm sorry i thought you
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
said interviews no i i know i look like
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
a quick study people people who eat
 
01:16:40.149 --> 01:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
right and exercise
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
and do all the quote healthy things
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
still get diseases and die
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
people who eat multiple buckets of
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
chicken a day
 
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
and smoke
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
multiple packs of cigarettes a day
 
01:16:58.470 --> 01:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
consume copious amounts of alcohol
 
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
never even consider looking at a
 
01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
treadmill let alone walking on one
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
lived to be 90 something years old
 
01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
there are people who did not get
 
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
they got coveted and they got over it
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
maybe they didn't get coveted at all we
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
you cannot prove
 
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
in any way shape or form that the
 
01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine saved a life
 
01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
because it would have to have been
 
01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:32.229 align:start position:0%
because it would have to have been
administered

01:17:32.229 --> 01:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
administered
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
when you are in your death throes they
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
shoot it in your veins
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
and then poof magically you're alive
 
01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:40.390 align:start position:0%
and then poof magically you're alive
again

01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
and that never happened it you cannot
 
01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
show where it saved a life did it i i
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
got sick
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
i saved
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
multiple tens of thousands of dollars
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
because i didn't go to the hospital do i
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
get an incentive
 
01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
i wasn't on a ventilator i didn't get
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
rem deserver i didn't put anybody out
 
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
but i also didn't get an opportunity to
 
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
go get my cancer screenings or any of
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
those other health checkups for over a
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
year because my doctor wasn't even
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
seeing in his patients because i didn't
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
have covet at the time this is all a
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
bunch of poppycock
 
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
okay mr chairman
 
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit late but i was going
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
to caution my my colleague and dear
 
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
friend a little bit earlier on he's
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:33.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
d.o.h does that stand for itl all right
 
01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
okay so representative greeson second by
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
representative moves in experience the
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
legislate and um i i will vote for this
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
motion but i'll tell you the reason why
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
i'm voting for this motion is that is
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
the itl motion i will vote for it
 
01:18:52.159 --> 01:18:53.430 align:start position:0%
the itl motion i will vote for it
because

01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
um two reasons one is i think it's a
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
little johnny come lately with this bill
 
01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
because i think too it's it's a little
 
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
it's old news now but more importantly i
 
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
actually frankly
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
don't think the incentive is is the
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
issue at this point because i think
 
01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:09.669 align:start position:0%
issue at this point because i think
anybody

01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
who would have gotten the vaccine
 
01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
would have gotten it okay and to
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
suddenly pass this legislation to say
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
okay by the way some insurance company
 
01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
could decide that they're going to give
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
you an incentive to do it
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think it will change anybody's
 
01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
mind that those people all those people
 
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
who refuse to get it are going to still
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
refuse to get it i mean i i've never
 
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
heard more cockamamie ideas about why
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
not to get the vaccine
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
just for the record
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
i think everyone should have a vaccine i
 
01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
have no doubt in my mind that the
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
vaccine absolutely reduced the amount of
 
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
people who went into a hospital okay now
 
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
i realize that you might not agree with
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
me on this all right but that is my
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
personal opinion that everyone should
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
have gotten the vaccine and will and
 
01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
right now i'm just discussing with my
 
01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:58.870 align:start position:0%
right now i'm just discussing with my
wife

01:19:58.870 --> 01:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
wife
 
01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
when i should get my second booster and
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
i was kind of holding out for next fall
 
01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
thinking that that's the time that i
 
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
would probably need a booster but i know
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
i will need one okay but i understand
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's my personal opinion and that's
 
01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
where i am
 
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
and i just think this bill
 
01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:16.550 align:start position:0%
and i just think this bill
has

01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
huge consequences and that's why i think
 
01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
studying it and trying to figure out how
 
01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
we address this issue of wellness i
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
think is very worthy and and i would
 
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
have kept uh you know keep it around and
 
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
work on it but
 
01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:30.070 align:start position:0%
work on it but
clearly

01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
that it's not the mood that i get from
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
so there are other ways to study
 
01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:40.719 align:start position:0%
wellness without using the vehicle of
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
any more discussion on the motion have
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
been expedient to legislate
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
all right seeing then all those in favor
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
raise your hand one two three all those
 
01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:55.430 align:start position:0%
raise your hand one two three all those
opposed

01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
the vote is three to two
 
01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:06.070 align:start position:0%
the vote is three to two
okay

01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
mr chair i have to go testify
 
01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:10.550 align:start position:0%
mr chair i have to go testify
okay

01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
all right so representative weston you
 
01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.310 align:start position:0%
all right so representative weston you
were

01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
you're on
 
01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:17.830 align:start position:0%
you're on
okay

01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
all right next up establishing committee
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
to study the oversight and operation of
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
the public deposit investment pool so
 
01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
this is our last one
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
okay so let me see who do i have i get
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
it all right uh
 
01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:34.310 align:start position:0%
it all right uh
grayson

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.550 align:start position:0%
grayson
um

01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
okay so terry
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
and we have fargo and weston
 
01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
okay so i just got off the phone this
 
01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:49.110 align:start position:0%
okay so i just got off the phone this
morning

01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
with former bank commissioner
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
and uh absolutely is true uh actually he
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
gave me the history because i always
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
liked the history let's start with the
 
01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:01.590 align:start position:0%
liked the history let's start with the
history

01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
history
 
01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:02.629 align:start position:0%
history
okay

01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:02.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh evidently this legislation was passed
 
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
on my my very first
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
first term on this committee
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:21.030 align:start position:0%
 
89.

01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
my very first term just for the record
 
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
my very first term i was on science and
 
01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:25.750 align:start position:0%
my very first term i was on science and
technology

01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
and uh they had about 19 bills and they
 
01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
were all anti-seabrook and i just
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
couldn't get off that committee fast
 
01:22:31.199 --> 01:22:34.629 align:start position:0%
couldn't get off that committee fast
enough

01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
so so uh now that was long before ready
 
01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
i mean actually i knew rennie at the
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
time because uh i was also a member of
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
ratepayers rights
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
and and which he was a part of the
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
organization so i get to read i met bob
 
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
bacchus and and randy cushing long
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
before i ever got into the legislature
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
because i i agree that we shouldn't be
 
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
sticking people with a creep it was
 
01:22:57.189 --> 01:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
having construction work in progress was
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
was definitely a problem
 
01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:00.550 align:start position:0%
was definitely a problem
anyway

01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
um this bill uh this law was passed by
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh roland beau rivera who was the bank
 
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner at the time
 
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
his wife was a state senator if i
 
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
remember correctly sheila
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
and um he came in and said uh this is
 
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
about this is back when the big the
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
first banking crisis you know this is we
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
all i think we we blame this banking
 
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
crisis actually on ronnie reagan and
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
rostankowski because of the tax act
 
01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
that was changed in 1988 and in that tax
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
act they took away the deductibility of
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
mortgage deductions and not worrying
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
about business corporate write-offs
 
01:23:45.189 --> 01:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
and uh and so that was a dramatic impact
 
01:23:47.830 --> 01:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
and then it was fearful that our banks
 
01:23:48.870 --> 01:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
were going to
 
01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
lose money hand over fists and that
 
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
would mean all these municipalities
 
01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.270 align:start position:0%
would mean all these municipalities
the

01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities are going to get caught
 
01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
in the middle of you know that they
 
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
would pass on those losses
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
to to to those people and uh
 
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
so and i and and we did have i mean
 
01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:08.719 align:start position:0%
obviously the original bank of new
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire i think failed at that at that
 
01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
time or had to be regarding yeah so i
 
01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
think you know the same anything so i
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
think so i think there was some truth in
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
what he was saying that that we need to
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:22.709 align:start position:0%
um so
when

01:24:22.709 --> 01:24:22.719 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
we were discussing this uh in in terms
 
01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
of the fact that yes you know the
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
banking department
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
um did you guys do any homework about
 
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
you know what other states do did you
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
okay yeah why don't you come and talk to
 
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
us and uh in terms of other states
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
nobody else
 
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
no one else thought it was a great idea
 
01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
for the banking department and i'm sure
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
that the only person who thought it was
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
a great idea was roland roberts at the
 
01:24:48.239 --> 01:24:51.750 align:start position:0%
a great idea was roland roberts at the
time

01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
he was financial institutions they said
 
01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:55.669 align:start position:0%
he was financial institutions they said
right

01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
so so based on our research um there are
 
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
45 local government um investment pools
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
within the united states
 
01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.149 align:start position:0%
within the united states
and

01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
as i said yesterday new hampshire is
 
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
the only state which is housed under the
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
authority of the banking department for
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
oversight the
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
majority of the states um that have
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
these they're under the state treasurer
 
01:25:20.629 --> 01:25:20.639 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
about 40 of them otherwise there are in
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
municipal sort of like local government
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh boards but majority is the state
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
treasurer that oversees
 
01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:32.639 align:start position:0%
this i did provide um
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
i emailed it on to the committee so i
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
apologize i did it but so the majority
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
is under state treasurer's office but we
 
01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
have a breakdown list of each state on
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
the name of it as well it's where it is
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
the upshot is that yes that what we
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
really want to do is two things
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
a is we want to move it out of banking
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
and put it under the state treasurer's
 
01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:55.910 align:start position:0%
and put it under the state treasurer's
office

01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
and b
 
01:25:59.110 --> 01:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
we want to
 
01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.550 align:start position:0%
we want to
um

01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
we really want the municipal association
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
the people who are the the ones who are
 
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
making these deposits we want to
 
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
restructure it so that this is really
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
their entity not necessarily a state
 
01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
entity uh and just kind of you know get
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
it as uh
 
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
much like other states do in terms of
 
01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:20.719 align:start position:0%
who who should be operating it so that's
 
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
pretty much that's where the the where i
 
01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
ended it with the conversation with
 
01:26:26.709 --> 01:26:26.719 align:start position:0%
jerry that's where i walked away not
 
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
saying that that was his idea but i'm
 
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
gonna i'm gonna own it that that was
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
what i might where i'm at at this moment
 
01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
thinking that we we um the way the
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
bill's written now it talks about how
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
whether the banking department should
 
01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:41.189 align:start position:0%
whether the banking department should
still

01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
be involved
 
01:26:42.639 --> 01:26:43.910 align:start position:0%
be involved
um

01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:44.709 align:start position:0%
um
a

01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't really talk about this
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
concept that i'm i'm i'm promoting is
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
that at some point in time we need to re
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
we need to separate it from
 
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh this is sort of a a spin-off we need
 
01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
to spin this off as a separate entity so
 
01:27:02.229 --> 01:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh i guess
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
for those who who care about this bill
 
01:27:05.199 --> 01:27:07.430 align:start position:0%
for those who who care about this bill
ryan

01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
ryan
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
would you want to do that as an interim
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
study or would you want to do it as
 
01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
rewrite this
 
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
rewrite this bill to
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
give it those guidelines and have a a
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
okay so in other words
 
01:27:24.719 --> 01:27:25.910 align:start position:0%
okay so in other words
basically

01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
we would i the problem i have with the
 
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
language as it is right now and
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
obviously i'm speaking for myself so
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
other members of the committee might
 
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
have a different opinion is that i think
 
01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
we need to give a more
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
powerful charge
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
to that committee
 
01:27:40.629 --> 01:27:40.639 align:start position:0%
okay in terms of a tasking
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay the tasking say we are saying we
 
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
want this to be
 
01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:47.590 align:start position:0%
want this to be
um

01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
moved out of banking
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
moved into
 
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
the treasurer's office
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
a and b
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
we want it to
 
01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:57.350 align:start position:0%
we want it to
have

01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
the appropriate um you know
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
the entities really be changing it
 
01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:04.639 align:start position:0%
rather than this being the state you
 
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
know calling it bp dip right or that it
 
01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be set up like other states
 
01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
have done which is the the board of
 
01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
directors is the municipal the
 
01:28:16.950 --> 01:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
associations that are are the ones who
 
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
it could still be it could be any one of
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:33.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
all right all right so how did rather
 
01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
what are you thinking when you said when
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
you say keeping it as a study you mean
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
he wants to get senators by him so i i i
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
think well once again uh speaking
 
01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:52.550 align:start position:0%
think well once again uh speaking
personally

01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
personally
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
as you did uh mr chairman uh i i agree
 
01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
with your sentiments i i think we ought
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
to in this case
 
01:28:59.679 --> 01:29:00.550 align:start position:0%
to in this case
uh

01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:03.110 --> 01:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank the uh
 
01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.149 align:start position:0%
thank the uh
uh

01:29:04.149 --> 01:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
the representations that that we see uh
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
from other states as being
 
01:29:13.110 --> 01:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
instructive and inspirational with
 
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
respect to a change here
 
01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
the way we do this in new hampshire
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
prior to
 
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
coming in this morning i was thinking
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
about this and thought yes it should be
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
the treasure
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
this would be come under the treasure
 
01:29:29.189 --> 01:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
and whose responsibility is is overall
 
01:29:32.229 --> 01:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
oversight of funds here in new hampshire
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh the depositors if you will this our
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
favorite word these days is stakeholders
 
01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
how they're appointed or elected
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
um i'm not down to that level yet but it
 
01:29:47.110 --> 01:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
needs to be a representative
 
01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:47.990 align:start position:0%
needs to be a representative
group

01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
and i think that that whether they're
 
01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
appointed or they're elected we can
 
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
debate that um but it ought to be that
 
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
group that government that governance
 
01:29:58.629 --> 01:29:58.639 align:start position:0%
yes to govern yes
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative peace
 
01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:02.639 align:start position:0%
am i understanding correctly that the
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
the fund this this p-dip
 
01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:06.310 align:start position:0%
the fund this this p-dip
function

01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
function
 
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
p dip
 
01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh is not just
 
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities but there are some
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
private entities that have
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
monies in there that are managed no no
 
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:28.229 --> 01:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
whose money is actually in there because
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
what i would be concerned about with you
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
know with with the management or the
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
control of these funds
 
01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:35.270 align:start position:0%
control of these funds
is

01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
municipals uh you know you go for
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere from manchester to wentworth
 
01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
and i would hate to see a whole bunch of
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
wentworths being dominated by the
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
interests of a manchester uh you know
 
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
and so it just becomes a steamroll we're
 
01:30:53.110 --> 01:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
going to manage the way we want to
 
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
manage it
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
take it take it or leave it so there
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
needs to make sure that that whoever is
 
01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
going to have oversight over this um
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
is truly representative of all of the
 
01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:07.669 align:start position:0%
is truly representative of all of the
depositors

01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
depositors
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders whatever i hate that
 
01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
term but anyway
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh so so and then i also would want to
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh given that there and i don't know if
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's if it's already codified somewhere
 
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
in statute i haven't seen it but i know
 
01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
that the an executive order presidential
 
01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
executive order uh was done back in uh
 
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
january of last year that removed a
 
01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:33.030 align:start position:0%
january of last year that removed a
requirement

01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:31:36.629 --> 01:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
that these types of managers
 
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
had a fiduciary responsibility to the
 
01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:42.229 align:start position:0%
had a fiduciary responsibility to the
investors

01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
investors
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
so that they they uh it was it was
 
01:31:44.639 --> 01:31:45.990 align:start position:0%
so that they they uh it was it was
removed

01:31:45.990 --> 01:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
removed
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh and therefore would leave vulnerable
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
because it would allow them to make
 
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
financial decisions and investments that
 
01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
may or may not actually be to the best
 
01:31:57.910 --> 01:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
interest of the investor but that would
 
01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:59.110 align:start position:0%
interest of the investor but that would
pursue

01:31:59.110 --> 01:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
pursue
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
some other
 
01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh motivation so the return on the
 
01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
investment is not always guaranteed to
 
01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
be maximized unless it is by the
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
direction of the depositor who may say i
 
01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
want it to go in that direction versus
 
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
another way so i i want to make sure
 
01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
that whoever is managing these funds is
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
actually obligated to to maximize the
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
return and i'm not saying that's not a
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
criticism of who's who's handling it now
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh i i don't know
 
01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.189 align:start position:0%
uh i i don't know
um

01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:29.199 --> 01:32:30.470 align:start position:0%
um
but

01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
my concern is is to make sure that they
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
are obligated to be fiduciaries
 
01:32:38.709 --> 01:32:38.719 align:start position:0%
of this money
 
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
obligated to the investor i think i
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
think they're pretty well well i don't
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
want pretty well i want it codified in
 
01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.950 align:start position:0%
want pretty well i want it codified in
law

01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
okay well i mean i bet you if you only
 
01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
because in the law now this is only
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
because of the presidential executive
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
what does it say in your pdip now does
 
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
it say anything about
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
investment responsibilities in the in
 
01:33:16.149 --> 01:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
but is that written in the statute or is
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
that written in the only in that
 
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
agreement you have with the people who
 
01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
are doing the uh
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
yeah and again it's only because of the
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
exact the presidential executive order
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
that that was removed
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
that that that was that requirement was
 
01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
was was removed and so i want to make
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
sure that it that we are making sure
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
that they have that obligation i know
 
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
that i think i know what you're
 
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint of being an
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
individual investor there was a big
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
debate around that and i i'd have to go
 
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
back and do the research on that
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
um mr chair about on the issue of
 
01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:55.430 align:start position:0%
um mr chair about on the issue of
representation

01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
representation
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
commission or committee right and
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
speaking to representative greeson's
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
banks or investors
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh not being represented i think as we
 
01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
get down now drill down deeper here
 
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
that we might want to
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
consider if we
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
if we're not going to be the appointed
 
01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:21.990 align:start position:0%
if we're not going to be the appointed
body

01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
body
 
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
or the treasurer is is not that we if we
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
have that concern that we need to be
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
specific about that
 
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of providing uh the the the
 
01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
requirements as to
 
01:34:34.639 --> 01:34:35.510 align:start position:0%
requirements as to
uh

01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
who shall
 
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
be represented
 
01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
you know and getting
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
there shall be representatives from
 
01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh banking or institutions or
 
01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities of
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
a small medium and large size
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
i'm just thinking of sodas right now so
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
here's here
 
01:34:55.109 --> 01:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
that is that i think that addresses
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative griezmann's concern if in
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
fact there would be an issue that the
 
01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
the larger municipalities and banks
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
would dominate if they
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
were appointed or particularly if they
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
were elected and that the the smaller
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
community smaller institutions smaller
 
01:35:12.870 --> 01:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities could could be left out
 
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
we've seen this happen over and over
 
01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:16.159 align:start position:0%
again so i just wanted to think about
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
that i think you guys should have a
 
01:35:19.109 --> 01:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
little bit of the cart to get ahead of
 
01:35:19.119 --> 01:35:19.830 align:start position:0%
little bit of the cart to get ahead of
the

01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
yeah the whole the horses
 
01:35:22.159 --> 01:35:23.270 align:start position:0%
yeah the whole the horses
because

01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
what i'm thinking is the same issue we
 
01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:27.679 align:start position:0%
had before with it with the
 
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
state-based thing
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
all we're saying at this point is that
 
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
we want to create a study committee
 
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
that is charged to go look what these
 
01:35:40.470 --> 01:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
other 44
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
entities look like and pick one
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
and recommend it for future legislation
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
come january at that point in time
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
you can then make make sure you get the
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal responsibilities written into
 
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
that statute when we revise that bill
 
01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
yes and what we're doing is we're
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
already starting to do that work so i
 
01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
agree with you yes okay back on the
 
01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
prior question yes okay
 
01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
how does everybody feel about that
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
that makes sense that we would just go
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
back and look at what other states are
 
01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
doing and
 
01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
and and uh and charge a
 
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:14.790 align:start position:0%
and and uh and charge a
a

01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:17.360 align:start position:0%
a legislative study committee
 
01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
three house number three centers
 
01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
and uh and just gonna revise that
 
01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
language to really tell them to focus in
 
01:36:24.719 --> 01:36:25.510 align:start position:0%
language to really tell them to focus in
on

01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:26.550 align:start position:0%
on
um

01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
looking at what other states have
 
01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:30.159 align:start position:0%
accomplished or doing
 
01:36:33.109 --> 01:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
um and and whether we go ahead and say
 
01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
state treasurer like uh you know we
 
01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
could probably say that
 
01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:39.350 align:start position:0%
could probably say that
so

01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
would you suggest then an amendment to
 
01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
this yes
 
01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:44.229 align:start position:0%
this yes
now

01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:36:47.430 --> 01:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
my real concern on is this date this
 
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
delivery date of november 1st of 2022
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
right so basically what we would be
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
doing is this would be a study committee
 
01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
that would meet this fall
 
01:36:57.109 --> 01:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
now this would be outside because it's
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
not in a room study this would be
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
outside of our committee right so uh
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
three selected people would be chosen
 
01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
and i know representative mcalee has
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
already told me that he wants to be the
 
01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:07.189 align:start position:0%
already told me that he wants to be the
dem

01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
dem
 
01:37:11.109 --> 01:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
and uh and for the house side and uh we
 
01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
would uh basically they would then go
 
01:37:15.750 --> 01:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
and look at all the different options
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
that are out there
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of what other states are
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
doing okay and then and then pick and
 
01:37:22.709 --> 01:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
choose which one they like best and then
 
01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
that would come in as legislation for
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
come next january okay so you'll draft
 
01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
an amendment to this that we can move
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
this along now and we can keep this date
 
01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
that date exactly
 
01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
i think with inflation being at maximum
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
levels uh rate of return is going to be
 
01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
an issue because municipal budgets are
 
01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
going to get steamrollered with uh
 
01:37:51.109 --> 01:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
with inflation so rate of return would
 
01:37:53.109 --> 01:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
be something i would be interested in in
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
these other 40 states is that possible
 
01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
to collect maybe that data
 
01:37:59.830 --> 01:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
yes i could see you typically uh the
 
01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
their public annual reports so i can
 
01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:03.679 align:start position:0%
look through and see if i could find it
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
yeah there are republic reports yeah
 
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
that they would have in the various
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
include that in the charge of the study
 
01:38:10.639 --> 01:38:11.990 align:start position:0%
include that in the charge of the study
committee

01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:12.870 align:start position:0%
committee
uh

01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
as that's one of the things to look at
 
01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
yes yeah i got that right
 
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
because you're in charge of writing this
 
01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:23.109 align:start position:0%
because you're in charge of writing this
amendment

01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
but just to note um a star presented
 
01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
please question regarding fiduciary
 
01:38:30.229 --> 01:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
obligations there is the um so there's
 
01:38:32.709 --> 01:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
federal law that also
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
is so like the investment advisor act of
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
1940 these investment advisors
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
oh a fiduciary obligation as well as
 
01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
then is delineated within the contracts
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:47.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
so so of course uh
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
you referenced what the federal um the
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
investment advisory act of 1940 so
 
01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
there's securities laws which require
 
01:39:00.149 --> 01:39:00.159 align:start position:0%
investment advisors in this case pfm
 
01:39:00.159 --> 01:39:00.870 align:start position:0%
investment advisors in this case pfm
to

01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
uphold certain fiduciary obligations um
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
as well as in our rfs all investment
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
advisors yes yes and they are so are you
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
familiar with what representative
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
greeson was alluding to or describing
 
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
and that i
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
confirmed is that
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
there was a change that was made within
 
01:39:18.629 --> 01:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
the last couple two or three years
 
01:39:18.639 --> 01:39:20.149 align:start position:0%
the last couple two or three years
where

01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
financial firms did not have to to be
 
01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
fiduciaries any longer
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
so my understanding um not i am not
 
01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
there was a big debate around that and
 
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
you're not familiar with that no i don't
 
01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
okay well not like i've never heard
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
we'll need well
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
yes you need to let us see that so we'll
 
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
need to interact with you on that so
 
01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
that you're aware of that because
 
01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
because if there's a federal statute and
 
01:39:45.669 --> 01:39:45.679 align:start position:0%
it applies and then i don't understand
 
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
what happened then we'll need to get to
 
01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
the bottom of that thank you and then
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
it's also addressed in our contracts too
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
so that would override well that that
 
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
would override i mean yes
 
01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:56.310 align:start position:0%
would override i mean yes
okay

01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
so we'll not take action on this and
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
we'll wait have the amendment and take
 
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
action on this next thursday and what
 
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
i'll do is you'll get me that
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
we'll start working on this over the
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
weekend so we can get something out to
 
01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:10.790 align:start position:0%
weekend so we can get something out to
everybody

01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later okay
 
01:40:16.149 --> 01:40:16.159 align:start position:0%
all right that's it
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:51.510 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:51.520 --> 01:41:10.950 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:34.950 align:start position:0%
 
everybody

01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:40.950 --> 01:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.159 --> 01:42:34.149 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:34.159 --> 01:42:58.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:30.310 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:48.159 --> 01:44:05.669 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:44:05.669 --> 01:44:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:05.679 --> 01:44:26.149 align:start position:0%
 
time

01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:26.159 --> 01:44:46.390 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:46.400 --> 01:45:10.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:46:05.590 --> 01:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:22.790 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:30.719 --> 01:46:35.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:35.280 --> 03:02:43.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:02:43.510 --> 03:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:47.750 --> 03:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
just ask me that um i see him in the um

by that organization so we had a carve
 
03:19:01.910 --> 03:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
out of the legislation that allow
 
03:19:04.150 --> 03:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
for this miwas which is multiple
 
03:19:04.160 --> 03:19:05.590 align:start position:0%
for this miwas which is multiple
employer

03:19:05.590 --> 03:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
employer
 
03:19:07.030 --> 03:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
so you have multiple employers you know
 
03:19:08.469 --> 03:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
when you think of a car dealer then
 
03:19:11.429 --> 03:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
multiple car dealerships multi-employer
 
03:19:12.950 --> 03:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
the organization and the bankers
 
03:19:15.269 --> 03:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
association same thing that they were
 
03:19:17.349 --> 03:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
they were coming together they had an
 
03:19:19.510 --> 03:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
association so that was the one of the
 
03:19:21.349 --> 03:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
most important things the association
 
03:19:22.710 --> 03:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
had to exist
 
03:19:25.110 --> 03:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
prior to it and that they happened to
 
03:19:26.469 --> 03:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
come together and have a health
 
03:19:28.309 --> 03:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
insurance product and they would be
 
03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
exempt from the uh 7-eleven and the
 
03:19:32.790 --> 03:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
community rating requirement and
 
03:19:34.389 --> 03:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
everything because they would do that
 
03:19:35.830 --> 03:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
within themselves within the
 
03:19:38.630 --> 03:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
organization but the key number there
 
03:19:42.469 --> 03:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
was 3 000 lives
 
03:19:43.910 --> 03:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
and that's very important to remember
 
03:19:46.870 --> 03:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
the 3000 lies because often when we came
 
03:19:49.269 --> 03:19:49.279 align:start position:0%
back to revisit this legislature
 
03:19:51.670 --> 03:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
years and every year it was always about
 
03:19:51.680 --> 03:19:53.190 align:start position:0%
years and every year it was always about
um

03:19:53.190 --> 03:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:56.070 --> 03:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
what was the uh the
 
03:19:59.190 --> 03:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
key element that made them legitimately
 
03:20:00.870 --> 03:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
separate you know for him to be out
 
03:20:04.150 --> 03:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
exempted out of the statute and um
 
03:20:07.190 --> 03:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
so now curtis berries uh who represents
 
03:20:09.990 --> 03:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
the uh retail association
 
03:20:13.110 --> 03:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
who at the time did not have amiibo
 
03:20:15.750 --> 03:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
created and have always thought about
 
03:20:18.389 --> 03:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
creating amiwa and we've always been
 
03:20:19.830 --> 03:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
told is as long as you have three
 
03:20:22.070 --> 03:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
thousand lives you could you could join
 
03:20:23.269 --> 03:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
the club
 
03:20:25.590 --> 03:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh and good afternoon
 
03:20:26.950 --> 03:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee i am curtis
 
03:20:28.150 --> 03:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
barry here on behalf of the new
 
03:20:31.030 --> 03:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire retail association
 
03:20:32.710 --> 03:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
first to remind you that retail
 
03:20:34.950 --> 03:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
association in new hampshire is made up
 
03:20:36.070 --> 03:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
of both
 
03:20:38.389 --> 03:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
large national chains and several
 
03:20:40.550 --> 03:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
hundred new hampshire-based businesses
 
03:20:42.469 --> 03:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
and it's on behalf of that the latter
 
03:20:42.479 --> 03:20:43.269 align:start position:0%
and it's on behalf of that the latter
group

03:20:43.269 --> 03:20:43.279 align:start position:0%
group
 
03:20:45.910 --> 03:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
that i appear here today uh before i
 
03:20:48.229 --> 03:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
begin my very brief remarks um in
 
03:20:50.389 --> 03:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
response to the the
 
03:20:51.750 --> 03:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
observation that there's just one
 
03:20:53.190 --> 03:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill
 
03:20:54.870 --> 03:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
i'll point out that the bill came out of
 
03:20:57.190 --> 03:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
the senate committee five to nothing
 
03:20:58.389 --> 03:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
with five to nothing ought to pass
 
03:20:59.830 --> 03:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation and passed on a voice
 
03:21:03.429 --> 03:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
vote so seem to have fairly unanimous
 
03:21:06.870 --> 03:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:09.510 --> 03:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
among the small business members of the
 
03:21:11.349 --> 03:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
retail association
 
03:21:14.070 --> 03:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
one thing that they've said to me that
 
03:21:16.550 --> 03:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
i've heard in this is my 23rd year
 
03:21:18.229 --> 03:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
representing the association it's been
 
03:21:20.790 --> 03:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
fairly consistent among the top if not
 
03:21:22.790 --> 03:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
the number one impediment to hiring
 
03:21:22.800 --> 03:21:23.750 align:start position:0%
the number one impediment to hiring
people

03:21:23.750 --> 03:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:21:25.830 --> 03:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
is the rapidly rising cost of health
 
03:21:27.429 --> 03:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums to provide the
 
03:21:29.910 --> 03:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
benefit for their employees
 
03:21:30.950 --> 03:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
this year
 
03:21:32.870 --> 03:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's exacerbated by the fact that
 
03:21:34.389 --> 03:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
they're having to pay
 
03:21:37.429 --> 03:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
10 percent 15 20 more just to hire
 
03:21:40.550 --> 03:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
people and yet the small the small group
 
03:21:42.870 --> 03:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums they're experiencing
 
03:21:46.630 --> 03:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
are north of 10 increases year over year
 
03:21:49.510 --> 03:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately what that means is
 
03:21:52.150 --> 03:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
when they're providing a benefit
 
03:21:53.670 --> 03:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
they're reducing the benefit that
 
03:21:55.990 --> 03:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
they're provided possibly they're
 
03:21:57.750 --> 03:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
passing along some of the increased
 
03:21:59.269 --> 03:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
costs to their employees in higher
 
03:22:02.229 --> 03:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
co-pays higher co-insurance those sorts
 
03:22:03.269 --> 03:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
of things
 
03:22:05.590 --> 03:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
so it's a shared cost that seems to be
 
03:22:07.670 --> 03:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
really unsustainable
 
03:22:09.990 --> 03:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
i'm glad mr chair that you answered that
 
03:22:11.750 --> 03:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
question because i'm certainly no expert
 
03:22:14.389 --> 03:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
in me was or association health plans
 
03:22:16.150 --> 03:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
and i guess my testimony is focused on
 
03:22:18.309 --> 03:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
the purpose which is to help small
 
03:22:20.229 --> 03:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
business attain a more affordable health
 
03:22:22.630 --> 03:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
care coverage and new coverage options
 
03:22:24.790 --> 03:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh so that they can continue to provide
 
03:22:27.269 --> 03:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
a robust health insurance plan benefit
 
03:22:29.349 --> 03:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
for their employees i'm happy to answer
 
03:22:30.550 --> 03:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
questions but i'm going to guess the
 
03:22:32.150 --> 03:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
insurance department's going to be much
 
03:22:34.150 --> 03:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
better qualified than i am
 
03:22:36.790 --> 03:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
and they're not here m.i.a oh okay did
 
03:22:39.670 --> 03:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:39.680 --> 03:22:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:22:41.030 --> 03:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:22:47.190 --> 03:22:47.200 align:start position:0%

well thank you for bringing those over

03:23:03.830 --> 03:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
of the approximate number of
 
03:23:07.269 --> 03:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
smaller businesses that might be in this
 
03:23:09.910 --> 03:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
association in our association your

so just to give you a little bit of
 
03:24:00.800 --> 03:24:01.910 align:start position:0%
so just to give you a little bit of
background

03:24:01.910 --> 03:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
background
 
03:24:05.110 --> 03:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
amiwa is a multiple employer welfare
 
03:24:07.349 --> 03:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
arrangement and this is defined in
 
03:24:10.070 --> 03:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
federal statute under the urissa law
 
03:24:11.910 --> 03:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
which is department of labor is the one
 
03:24:14.389 --> 03:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
who oversees it
 
03:24:15.990 --> 03:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
and miwas are
 
03:24:18.309 --> 03:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
employee welfare benefit plans or other
 
03:24:20.229 --> 03:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
arrangements which are established or
 
03:24:22.070 --> 03:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
maintained for the purpose of offering
 
03:24:24.229 --> 03:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
or providing health benefits to eligible
 
03:24:26.950 --> 03:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
employees of two or more employers to
 
03:24:29.910 --> 03:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
their beneficiaries
 
03:24:32.309 --> 03:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of confusion comes about between
 
03:24:34.950 --> 03:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
what a miwa and an ahp an association
 
03:24:37.429 --> 03:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
health plan is an association health
 
03:24:41.110 --> 03:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
plan is a type of miwa so they are very
 
03:24:43.910 --> 03:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
similar in
 
03:24:45.830 --> 03:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
but we use different terms to talk about
 
03:24:47.750 --> 03:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
and part of that is because
 
03:24:50.309 --> 03:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
in june of 2018 the department of labor
 
03:24:52.710 --> 03:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
promulgated rules that expanded the
 
03:24:56.309 --> 03:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:59.030 --> 03:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
these rules were later
 
03:25:00.950 --> 03:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
11 states in the district of columbia
 
03:25:03.990 --> 03:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
challenged these rules and on march 29
 
03:25:07.429 --> 03:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
2019 the u.s district court
 
03:25:09.269 --> 03:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
in the district of columbia issued an
 
03:25:11.510 --> 03:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
order vacating
 
03:25:13.830 --> 03:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
the bona fide association and working
 
03:25:17.510 --> 03:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:21.349 --> 03:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
they found that those rules exceeded
 
03:25:23.910 --> 03:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
what has already been defined in the
 
03:25:27.269 --> 03:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
erisa statute of what an employer is
 
03:25:29.670 --> 03:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
so at that time the decision was
 
03:25:32.150 --> 03:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
appealed and it was pending appeal when
 
03:25:33.910 --> 03:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
the administration changed once the
 
03:25:36.150 --> 03:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
biden administration came in they filed
 
03:25:39.429 --> 03:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
an abeyance so currently that is still
 
03:25:41.190 --> 03:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
held in advance since there's a new
 
03:25:42.950 --> 03:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
administration they're evaluating what
 
03:25:44.150 --> 03:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
to do
 
03:25:46.870 --> 03:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
so that's where the idea of association
 
03:25:48.950 --> 03:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
health plans came about and that's where
 
03:25:50.550 --> 03:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of that terminology came so there
 
03:25:51.910 --> 03:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
was a period of time where there was
 
03:25:54.469 --> 03:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
this expanded opportunity where these
 
03:25:56.550 --> 03:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
association health plans would qualify
 
03:25:57.830 --> 03:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
as a miwa
 
03:26:00.469 --> 03:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what this bill i believe
 
03:26:03.590 --> 03:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
is addressing so to the extent that that
 
03:26:06.150 --> 03:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
court decision were to later be appealed
 
03:26:07.990 --> 03:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
and overturned or the department of
 
03:26:10.229 --> 03:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
labor were to go back and do rule making
 
03:26:12.229 --> 03:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
to adjust those definitions maybe to
 
03:26:14.229 --> 03:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
better comply with what's in the orisa
 
03:26:14.239 --> 03:26:15.510 align:start position:0%
better comply with what's in the orisa
statute

03:26:15.510 --> 03:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:26:17.269 --> 03:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
this bill or
 
03:26:19.190 --> 03:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
our law would be in place to address
 
03:26:21.750 --> 03:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
those issues so
 
03:26:23.269 --> 03:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
me was
 
03:26:25.510 --> 03:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's a very complicated
 
03:26:25.520 --> 03:26:26.790 align:start position:0%
it's a very complicated
subject

03:26:26.790 --> 03:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
subject
 
03:26:29.269 --> 03:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
so i will try my best to answer your
 
03:26:29.279 --> 03:26:30.550 align:start position:0%
so i will try my best to answer your
questions

03:26:30.550 --> 03:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:26:32.150 --> 03:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
but that just gives you a little bit of
 
03:26:34.070 --> 03:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
background i just one more thing i want
 
03:26:36.070 --> 03:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
to point out is that your ability to
 
03:26:39.269 --> 03:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
establish a miwa does not necessarily
 
03:26:42.150 --> 03:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
equate your ability to purchase group
 
03:26:44.070 --> 03:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
insurance especially when we're talking
 
03:26:47.510 --> 03:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
about major medical insurance
 
03:26:50.790 --> 03:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
in order to qualify as a large group
 
03:26:52.950 --> 03:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
that large group definition is in the
 
03:26:55.510 --> 03:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
public health statute not in orissa
 
03:26:58.870 --> 03:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
statute and that public health statute
 
03:27:00.790 --> 03:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
says that it has to be an
 
03:27:02.389 --> 03:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
employer of
 
03:27:04.389 --> 03:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
50 or more
 
03:27:07.429 --> 03:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
50-plus employees in order to qualify as
 
03:27:08.870 --> 03:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
large group
 
03:27:10.870 --> 03:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
so that's different and i think some of
 
03:27:12.469 --> 03:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
the confusion where this comes about is
 
03:27:14.550 --> 03:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of smaller employers
 
03:27:16.630 --> 03:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
that would like to band together
 
03:27:18.870 --> 03:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
to create a miwa thinking that they're
 
03:27:20.950 --> 03:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
going to get this large group rate and
 
03:27:22.870 --> 03:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's not the way it works
 
03:27:24.790 --> 03:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
even if you're can band together as a
 
03:27:27.750 --> 03:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
miwa you're still rated at the amount of
 
03:27:29.990 --> 03:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
employees each individual employer has
 
03:27:32.309 --> 03:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
so they still would be rated as a small
 
03:27:32.319 --> 03:27:33.590 align:start position:0%
so they still would be rated as a small
group

03:27:33.590 --> 03:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
group
 
03:27:36.550 --> 03:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
so those are some of the highlights but
 
03:27:39.110 --> 03:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
03:27:42.630 --> 03:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
okay so my question is this is how many
 
03:27:43.910 --> 03:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
pages here
 
03:27:47.190 --> 03:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
so at the end of the day
 
03:27:47.200 --> 03:27:48.070 align:start position:0%
so at the end of the day
the

03:27:48.070 --> 03:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:27:48.080 --> 03:27:48.950 align:start position:0%
the
um

03:27:48.950 --> 03:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:51.190 --> 03:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
not to be confused with me was and not
 
03:27:52.710 --> 03:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
to be confused
 
03:27:52.720 --> 03:27:54.870 align:start position:0%
to be confused
um

03:27:54.870 --> 03:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:57.830 --> 03:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
the idea the original idea of the
 
03:28:00.389 --> 03:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
affiliations was uh is could a chamber
 
03:28:01.910 --> 03:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
of commerce
 
03:28:04.630 --> 03:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
have all its members join because
 
03:28:06.790 --> 03:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
they're all members of the chamber could
 
03:28:10.950 --> 03:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:14.389 --> 03:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
arrangement so what's in this bill
 
03:28:14.399 --> 03:28:15.269 align:start position:0%
arrangement so what's in this bill
as

03:28:15.269 --> 03:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:28:16.870 --> 03:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
pertain to that
 
03:28:20.389 --> 03:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:26.710 --> 03:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:28.309 --> 03:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
again we did not draft the spill so
 
03:28:29.990 --> 03:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
we're just here to provide
 
03:28:32.469 --> 03:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
some background information but the idea
 
03:28:35.590 --> 03:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
is that a chamber of commerce if under
 
03:28:38.070 --> 03:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
the department of labor rules that this
 
03:28:39.990 --> 03:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
court has set aside
 
03:28:42.389 --> 03:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
would have allowed like a chamber of
 
03:28:45.349 --> 03:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
commerce to get its members together to
 
03:28:49.190 --> 03:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
develop this i this this group employer
 
03:28:50.790 --> 03:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
so it is expanding the definition of
 
03:28:54.150 --> 03:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
employer and
 
03:28:55.670 --> 03:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
part of what was set aside in those
 
03:28:58.710 --> 03:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
rules too is that an employer could be
 
03:29:01.110 --> 03:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
a self-employed individual
 
03:29:03.190 --> 03:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
that is different than the way that was
 
03:29:05.190 --> 03:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
the realtors wanted that one yeah so
 
03:29:06.790 --> 03:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
that's different than what how the
 
03:29:08.630 --> 03:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
department of labor had previously been
 
03:29:10.389 --> 03:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
interpreting that it had to be an
 
03:29:12.790 --> 03:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
employee you as a sole proprietor plus
 
03:29:15.510 --> 03:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
one employee right so this would allow a
 
03:29:17.830 --> 03:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
lot of sole proprietors to band together
 
03:29:19.750 --> 03:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
to establish a group
 
03:29:19.760 --> 03:29:20.870 align:start position:0%
to establish a group
but

03:29:20.870 --> 03:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:29:22.630 --> 03:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
those rules have been
 
03:29:24.469 --> 03:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
held in advance for now
 
03:29:25.910 --> 03:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
see that's a legal term that i don't
 
03:29:27.670 --> 03:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
know what that means that means the
 
03:29:29.990 --> 03:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
rules were struck down the certain
 
03:29:32.950 --> 03:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
portions of the rules so those portions
 
03:29:34.229 --> 03:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
relating to the definition of an
 
03:29:37.110 --> 03:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
employer were struck down and are not
 
03:29:40.710 --> 03:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
enforceable and the appeal is just being
 
03:29:43.590 --> 03:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
held so it hasn't been vacated it could
 
03:29:46.630 --> 03:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
still proceed but right now the
 
03:29:48.870 --> 03:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
government has asked that we just put a
 
03:29:50.550 --> 03:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
hold on things while they reassess the
 
03:29:52.870 --> 03:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
situation and it could be that they do
 
03:29:54.389 --> 03:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
eventually decide to move forward with
 
03:29:56.469 --> 03:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
that appeal or they could go back and
 
03:29:59.750 --> 03:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
amend their rules through rulemaking
 
03:30:02.309 --> 03:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of indecision right now
 
03:30:04.630 --> 03:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
but if this bill is being passed an
 
03:30:09.190 --> 03:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
expectation of this issue being resolved
 
03:30:11.349 --> 03:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
i guess i want to know what what was the
 
03:30:13.750 --> 03:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
outcome out of you know
 
03:30:15.990 --> 03:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
what is the outcome of this bill and
 
03:30:18.790 --> 03:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
what is it saying is it is it allowable
 
03:30:21.429 --> 03:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
for our chamber commerce to organize and
 
03:30:23.590 --> 03:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
create an affiliation
 
03:30:25.110 --> 03:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
of course under new hampshire law they
 
03:30:30.150 --> 03:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:32.229 --> 03:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
is that still in here it's 3 000 lies
 
03:30:33.349 --> 03:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
still in here i mean there's a lot of
 
03:30:34.790 --> 03:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
pages here you expect me to read this
 
03:30:36.790 --> 03:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
the way it
 
03:30:39.590 --> 03:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
has bona fide pathway one and po bona
 
03:30:41.990 --> 03:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
fide pathway two that's what mirrors
 
03:30:44.710 --> 03:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
those department of labor rules and the
 
03:30:46.950 --> 03:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
bona fide pathway too has a number of
 
03:30:48.630 --> 03:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
factors so it could be the chamber of
 
03:30:50.550 --> 03:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
commerce doesn't even necessarily meet
 
03:30:53.110 --> 03:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
the pathway to requirements it's a
 
03:30:55.269 --> 03:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
case-by-case determination based on the
 
03:30:57.510 --> 03:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
facts of the association and there's a
 
03:30:59.670 --> 03:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
number of factors that go into it i
 
03:31:01.990 --> 03:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
think the idea with this bill is that if
 
03:31:03.910 --> 03:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
it passes
 
03:31:05.349 --> 03:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
in the current state it's not going to
 
03:31:08.229 --> 03:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
really change much but if the
 
03:31:10.469 --> 03:31:10.479 align:start position:0%
the federal rules issue gets resolved we
 
03:31:12.710 --> 03:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
will have something in place that would
 
03:31:14.550 --> 03:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
allow those types of associations and i
 
03:31:15.590 --> 03:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
also want to point out that they'll
 
03:31:17.190 --> 03:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
allow it that's yeah
 
03:31:18.550 --> 03:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
would allow it
 
03:31:18.560 --> 03:31:21.349 align:start position:0%
would allow it
so

03:31:21.349 --> 03:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:23.830 --> 03:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
our meanwhile law that's currently in
 
03:31:27.190 --> 03:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
place right now is only applicable to a
 
03:31:30.389 --> 03:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
self-funded miwa so if you're a miwa but
 
03:31:33.030 --> 03:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
you're purchasing commercial insurance
 
03:31:35.030 --> 03:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
our meal is not even applicable to you
 
03:31:36.790 --> 03:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
you're more of a purchasing alliance we
 
03:31:38.870 --> 03:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
have a separate statute for that
 
03:31:40.630 --> 03:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
and so this would only be for
 
03:31:42.790 --> 03:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
self-funded and the reason we regulate
 
03:31:43.830 --> 03:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
the cell phone is because we want to
 
03:31:45.830 --> 03:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
make sure their financials are in order
 
03:31:47.990 --> 03:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
and but they're also regulated at the
 
03:31:50.150 --> 03:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
federal level through the um
 
03:31:51.590 --> 03:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
department of labor because they would
 
03:31:54.950 --> 03:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
be erisa plans as well okay
 
03:32:01.429 --> 03:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:02.950 --> 03:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
03:32:05.190 --> 03:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
i heard somebody talk about the fact
 
03:32:06.830 --> 03:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
that you know there was an
 
03:32:10.150 --> 03:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
expense expenses have gone up
 
03:32:13.110 --> 03:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
most recently and it's becoming more
 
03:32:16.630 --> 03:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
less affordable to have the same type of
 
03:32:16.640 --> 03:32:18.870 align:start position:0%
less affordable to have the same type of
benefit

03:32:18.870 --> 03:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
03:32:20.950 --> 03:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
so my question to you is if the federal
 
03:32:22.469 --> 03:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
government took over the universal
 
03:32:24.630 --> 03:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
health care and made universal health
 
03:32:26.950 --> 03:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
care and took all those expenses off the
 
03:32:26.960 --> 03:32:27.990 align:start position:0%
care and took all those expenses off the
budget

03:32:27.990 --> 03:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:32:30.469 --> 03:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
of the of these various businesses would
 
03:32:33.030 --> 03:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
they like that
 
03:32:35.030 --> 03:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
not really in a position to comment on
 
03:32:39.269 --> 03:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
that i think the answer is pretty clear
 
03:32:39.279 --> 03:32:41.510 align:start position:0%
that i think the answer is pretty clear
okay

03:32:41.510 --> 03:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:32:42.790 --> 03:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:32:46.389 --> 03:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:46.399 --> 03:32:47.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:32:47.670 --> 03:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:32:49.910 --> 03:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
here's her what else do i have i don't
 
03:32:51.670 --> 03:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
have any more cards right
 
03:32:52.950 --> 03:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's it does anybody else want to
 
03:32:52.960 --> 03:32:55.910 align:start position:0%
that's it does anybody else want to
testify

03:32:55.910 --> 03:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:58.229 --> 03:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
okay we will oh
 
03:33:00.630 --> 03:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
how about do we have the overnight
 
03:33:02.070 --> 03:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
blue sheets
 
03:33:02.080 --> 03:33:07.190 align:start position:0%
blue sheets
chris

03:33:07.190 --> 03:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:22.469 --> 03:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:25.190 --> 03:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
okay we'll we won't worry but uh in
 
03:33:26.710 --> 03:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
committee we only had one saying one
 
03:33:26.720 --> 03:33:29.190 align:start position:0%
committee we only had one saying one
name

03:33:29.190 --> 03:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:31.269 --> 03:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
and she already spoke so uh well that i
 
03:33:33.510 --> 03:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
will close the public hearing
 
03:33:35.590 --> 03:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:33:39.030 --> 03:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully tyler will be around for the
 
03:33:40.790 --> 03:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
the stuff when we do this we will be
 
03:33:45.190 --> 03:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:45.200 --> 03:33:47.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:33:47.830 --> 03:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:33:50.150 --> 03:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
right so the big is you know what's the
 
03:33:52.710 --> 03:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
actual outcome you know what what what
 
03:33:56.070 --> 03:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:58.389 --> 03:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
or or is it just simply
 
03:34:00.229 --> 03:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
whichever way the court comes out this
 
03:34:05.750 --> 03:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:07.190 --> 03:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
that's what i love about a lawyer that's
 
03:34:09.269 --> 03:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
what i love about lawyers
 
03:34:10.790 --> 03:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
we have a running joke in this committee
 
03:34:10.800 --> 03:34:11.750 align:start position:0%
we have a running joke in this committee
ask

03:34:11.750 --> 03:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
ask
 
03:34:25.190 --> 03:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:26.550 --> 03:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
then you're gonna have to fix it in the
 
03:34:28.950 --> 03:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
rule rulemaking right
 
03:34:28.960 --> 03:34:31.349 align:start position:0%
rule rulemaking right
okay

03:34:31.349 --> 03:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:33.229 --> 03:34:33.239 align:start position:0%
all right next bill
 
03:34:35.750 --> 03:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
373 relative to coverage for certain
 
03:34:39.110 --> 03:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
mental illness okay 373 we'll start out
 
03:34:43.269 --> 03:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:44.469 --> 03:34:44.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:34:45.990 --> 03:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee i
 
03:34:47.910 --> 03:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
remain not jeb bradley
 
03:34:49.190 --> 03:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
my name is grant bosse with the new
 
03:34:51.349 --> 03:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire senate here to introduce
 
03:34:53.750 --> 03:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
senate bill 373 on behalf of senator
 
03:34:56.070 --> 03:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
bradley its prime sponsor senator
 
03:34:57.590 --> 03:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
bradley introduced this bill at the
 
03:34:59.590 --> 03:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
request of the insurance department to
 
03:35:01.750 --> 03:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
require that insurers submit a mental
 
03:35:04.630 --> 03:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
health benefit comparative analysis
 
03:35:06.550 --> 03:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
consistent with federal requirements to
 
03:35:08.550 --> 03:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
ensure they are in compliance with
 
03:35:10.870 --> 03:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
mental health parity requirements
 
03:35:12.630 --> 03:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
the bill also removes a state
 
03:35:14.710 --> 03:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
permissible maximum coverage cap for
 
03:35:14.720 --> 03:35:15.990 align:start position:0%
permissible maximum coverage cap for
autism

03:35:15.990 --> 03:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
autism
 
03:35:17.830 --> 03:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
this section would be preempted by
 
03:35:20.150 --> 03:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
federal mental health parity laws but
 
03:35:22.229 --> 03:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
could cause confusion if it were left in
 
03:35:24.870 --> 03:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
the state statute the bill also removes
 
03:35:26.389 --> 03:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
the requirement that the department
 
03:35:29.030 --> 03:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
develop rules for autism coverage opting
 
03:35:32.389 --> 03:35:32.399 align:start position:0%
for the enabling may language instead
 
03:35:33.910 --> 03:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
existing federal rules provide the
 
03:35:36.070 --> 03:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
necessary regulatory structure at this
 
03:35:37.830 --> 03:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
time michelle heaton of the insurance
 
03:35:39.830 --> 03:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
department is here to give us more
 
03:35:41.590 --> 03:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
complete understanding of the changes
 
03:35:43.269 --> 03:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
and i would defer any questions of the
 
03:35:45.110 --> 03:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
committee to her thank you for
 
03:35:46.870 --> 03:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
consideration of this legislation
 
03:35:49.030 --> 03:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
senator bradley asks for your support of
 
03:35:52.150 --> 03:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
senate bill 373.
 
03:35:55.750 --> 03:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you
 
03:36:00.469 --> 03:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:02.309 --> 03:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
got a card this time
 
03:36:03.910 --> 03:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
michelle heaton from the insurance
 
03:36:03.920 --> 03:36:09.349 align:start position:0%
michelle heaton from the insurance
department

03:36:09.349 --> 03:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:10.790 --> 03:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
hello again again
 
03:36:12.309 --> 03:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
i'm michelle heaton from the new
 
03:36:13.590 --> 03:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire insurance department i'm the
 
03:36:18.309 --> 03:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:20.229 --> 03:36:20.239 align:start position:0%
so we requested this legislation and are
 
03:36:22.389 --> 03:36:22.399 align:start position:0%
in support there are three parts to this
 
03:36:22.399 --> 03:36:23.670 align:start position:0%
in support there are three parts to this
bill

03:36:23.670 --> 03:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:36:25.349 --> 03:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
but the last two are more essentially
 
03:36:29.030 --> 03:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:30.630 --> 03:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
so for the first part new hampshire was
 
03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
one of the first states to perform a
 
03:36:33.910 --> 03:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
market conduct examination related to
 
03:36:35.990 --> 03:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
health parity compliance at the end of
 
03:36:38.389 --> 03:36:38.399 align:start position:0%
the exam two years ago
 
03:36:40.469 --> 03:36:40.479 align:start position:0%
we entered into a monitor monitoring
 
03:36:43.190 --> 03:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
agreements with anthem and harvard
 
03:36:43.200 --> 03:36:44.469 align:start position:0%
agreements with anthem and harvard
pilgrim

03:36:44.469 --> 03:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
pilgrim
 
03:36:46.070 --> 03:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
because there were red flags that came
 
03:36:48.150 --> 03:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
up and we could not conclude at the time
 
03:36:50.710 --> 03:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
that a violation had taken place those
 
03:36:52.229 --> 03:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
monitoring periods are have currently
 
03:36:54.309 --> 03:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
been extended another year
 
03:36:56.309 --> 03:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
so they're still ongoing
 
03:36:58.630 --> 03:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
the formal market conduct exam process
 
03:37:00.950 --> 03:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
is lengthy confidential and resource
 
03:37:03.349 --> 03:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
intensive this is not always ideal for
 
03:37:03.359 --> 03:37:05.190 align:start position:0%
intensive this is not always ideal for
transparency

03:37:05.190 --> 03:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
03:37:07.750 --> 03:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
effective use of resources
 
03:37:09.750 --> 03:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
and other issues the legislation
 
03:37:11.750 --> 03:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
clarifies that the parity compliance
 
03:37:11.760 --> 03:37:12.790 align:start position:0%
clarifies that the parity compliance
work

03:37:12.790 --> 03:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:37:14.710 --> 03:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
can take place in tandem with the new
 
03:37:16.710 --> 03:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
federal government requirements more
 
03:37:16.720 --> 03:37:17.990 align:start position:0%
federal government requirements more
efficiently

03:37:17.990 --> 03:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
efficiently
 
03:37:19.429 --> 03:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
the mental health parity requirements
 
03:37:21.750 --> 03:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
are frequently misunderstood
 
03:37:23.750 --> 03:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
mental health preparations are found in
 
03:37:26.710 --> 03:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
federal law and essentially require that
 
03:37:28.469 --> 03:37:28.479 align:start position:0%
the financial requirements and treatment
 
03:37:30.790 --> 03:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
limitations applicable to mental health
 
03:37:33.670 --> 03:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
or substance use disorder benefits are
 
03:37:34.950 --> 03:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
no more restrictive than those
 
03:37:40.469 --> 03:37:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:42.469 --> 03:37:42.479 align:start position:0%
ap is applicable to all health plans
 
03:37:44.309 --> 03:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
about the individual and group markets
 
03:37:47.190 --> 03:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
and does not mandate benefits only
 
03:37:49.910 --> 03:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
parity of the benefits offered
 
03:37:51.670 --> 03:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
however the aca does set minimum
 
03:37:53.990 --> 03:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
benefits for mental health by including
 
03:37:56.710 --> 03:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
and substance abuse treatment as it is
 
03:37:59.349 --> 03:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
an essential health benefit
 
03:38:02.790 --> 03:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
so the consolidated appropriations act
 
03:38:05.830 --> 03:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
of 2021 amended mapia to add new federal
 
03:38:08.150 --> 03:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements that carriers are
 
03:38:11.030 --> 03:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
expected to comply with
 
03:38:12.469 --> 03:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
so for each
 
03:38:14.550 --> 03:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
nqtl which is a non-quantitative
 
03:38:17.030 --> 03:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
treatment limit imposed the insurer must
 
03:38:18.950 --> 03:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
prepare a comparative analysis that
 
03:38:20.150 --> 03:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
includes that minimum a clear
 
03:38:23.190 --> 03:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
description of the nqtl identification
 
03:38:25.910 --> 03:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
of applicable plan terms and policies
 
03:38:28.150 --> 03:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
identification of the specific mental
 
03:38:30.309 --> 03:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
health substance use
 
03:38:32.950 --> 03:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
disorder and med surg benefits to which
 
03:38:35.910 --> 03:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
it applies identify any factors evidence
 
03:38:38.309 --> 03:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
standard sources
 
03:38:40.710 --> 03:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
strategies used and considered in the
 
03:38:43.269 --> 03:38:43.279 align:start position:0%
design and application and then detailed
 
03:38:45.910 --> 03:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
analysis demonstrating that the nqtls
 
03:38:49.030 --> 03:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
applied as written in an operation
 
03:38:51.590 --> 03:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
are comparable for mental health and
 
03:38:54.469 --> 03:38:54.479 align:start position:0%
the med surg benefits so what we would
 
03:38:57.510 --> 03:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
like to do is instead of having to do
 
03:39:00.469 --> 03:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
frequent mental parity examinations we
 
03:39:03.189 --> 03:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
would like to take this report and be
 
03:39:06.830 --> 03:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:06.840 --> 03:39:08.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:39:08.469 --> 03:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:10.469 --> 03:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
along with the department of labor who
 
03:39:13.030 --> 03:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
is also going to be doing this analysis
 
03:39:15.670 --> 03:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
and as well as cms
 
03:39:17.510 --> 03:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
and we envision this information
 
03:39:19.429 --> 03:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
becoming public and it aligns our
 
03:39:21.510 --> 03:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
efforts to streamline the reporting
 
03:39:23.269 --> 03:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
obligations on the carrier and
 
03:39:25.590 --> 03:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
strengthen the ability of the nhid and
 
03:39:27.349 --> 03:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
the federal government to identify
 
03:39:30.550 --> 03:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
violations consistently
 
03:39:32.630 --> 03:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
this would be a major step forward in
 
03:39:34.150 --> 03:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
ensuring mental health parity coverage
 
03:39:36.870 --> 03:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
requirements are met second the section
 
03:39:39.110 --> 03:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
removes what looks like a permitted cap
 
03:39:40.870 --> 03:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
on autism treatment
 
03:39:42.710 --> 03:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
this provision would most certainly be
 
03:39:45.030 --> 03:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
preempted by federal laws and it's not
 
03:39:45.040 --> 03:39:46.150 align:start position:0%
preempted by federal laws and it's not
cleared

03:39:46.150 --> 03:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
cleared
 
03:39:47.670 --> 03:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
but that's not clear to the readers of
 
03:39:49.830 --> 03:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
the statute so we're requesting to
 
03:39:52.309 --> 03:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
remove it to avoid any confusion
 
03:39:54.870 --> 03:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
and then finally we would like to change
 
03:39:57.429 --> 03:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
shall to may
 
03:40:00.710 --> 03:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
the nhid does not believe that
 
03:40:02.790 --> 03:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
rules are necessary and that's why none
 
03:40:04.630 --> 03:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
have been promulgated but in a recent
 
03:40:07.030 --> 03:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
lba audited it was identified as a
 
03:40:10.150 --> 03:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
deficiency that we did not have rules
 
03:40:11.590 --> 03:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
if the federal guidelines were to
 
03:40:13.990 --> 03:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
disappear then we would be in a position
 
03:40:15.990 --> 03:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
to promulgate rules
 
03:40:17.510 --> 03:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
so we asked that you act upon this
 
03:40:17.520 --> 03:40:18.630 align:start position:0%
so we asked that you act upon this
legislation

03:40:18.630 --> 03:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:40:21.349 --> 03:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions
 
03:40:23.110 --> 03:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
great representative greeson
 
03:40:24.630 --> 03:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
03:40:27.590 --> 03:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
your testimony in other legislation we
 
03:40:29.349 --> 03:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
use the words
 
03:40:33.030 --> 03:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
shall adopt rules as necessary
 
03:40:36.790 --> 03:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
and that seemed to pacify objections
 
03:40:39.590 --> 03:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's a shall but only as necessary so
 
03:40:41.830 --> 03:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
you change from shall to may which that
 
03:40:44.070 --> 03:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
always opens a can of worms would it be
 
03:40:45.590 --> 03:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
amenable to
 
03:40:48.150 --> 03:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
if if we were to change back to shall
 
03:40:50.790 --> 03:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
but then put it as necessary because you
 
03:40:52.630 --> 03:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
just said that it's possible that
 
03:40:54.550 --> 03:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
federal rules could change and then it
 
03:40:57.750 --> 03:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
may become necessary so what if we
 
03:40:59.830 --> 03:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
amended this to say shall
 
03:41:02.070 --> 03:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
as may be necessary
 
03:41:04.309 --> 03:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
that would be fine okay i know it's nit
 
03:41:06.710 --> 03:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
noid but we did it in another piece of
 
03:41:08.150 --> 03:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
legislation so i just want to see if
 
03:41:09.750 --> 03:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
we'd be consistent yeah we just want to
 
03:41:11.750 --> 03:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're not being forced to
 
03:41:12.950 --> 03:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
promulgate rules when they're not
 
03:41:12.960 --> 03:41:17.110 align:start position:0%
promulgate rules when they're not
necessary

03:41:17.110 --> 03:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:17.120 --> 03:41:17.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:41:17.910 --> 03:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:41:21.189 --> 03:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:25.590 --> 03:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:27.110 --> 03:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
um if you could
 
03:41:30.870 --> 03:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
go through the explanation for uh on
 
03:41:34.389 --> 03:41:34.399 align:start position:0%
the rule you ruled out section three
 
03:41:36.150 --> 03:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
part two section three
 
03:41:37.990 --> 03:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
03:41:41.269 --> 03:41:41.279 align:start position:0%
put on put in a cap or
 
03:41:44.309 --> 03:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
for this particular type of uh
 
03:41:44.319 --> 03:41:47.349 align:start position:0%
for this particular type of uh
um

03:41:47.349 --> 03:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:50.070 --> 03:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
autism i'm i i'm a little confused as to
 
03:41:51.990 --> 03:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
what that the
 
03:41:55.429 --> 03:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
what you intend to do by taking that out
 
03:41:58.870 --> 03:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
so this um autism provision
 
03:42:00.469 --> 03:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
and originally when the statute was
 
03:42:03.269 --> 03:42:03.279 align:start position:0%
passed it was pre-aca
 
03:42:05.590 --> 03:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
so there were treatment limitations put
 
03:42:08.790 --> 03:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
in there once the aca was passed
 
03:42:11.510 --> 03:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
aca federal law would likely preempt any
 
03:42:14.229 --> 03:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
of these treatment limitations and but
 
03:42:15.750 --> 03:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
they're still in our statute and it can
 
03:42:17.750 --> 03:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
cause some confusion because
 
03:42:19.429 --> 03:42:19.439 align:start position:0%
people will look at it and think that
 
03:42:21.590 --> 03:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
you can have treatment limitations when
 
03:42:23.189 --> 03:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
really federal law would prohibit you
 
03:42:24.229 --> 03:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
from doing that so we're just trying to
 
03:42:26.070 --> 03:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
clean up the statute to make clear that
 
03:42:27.750 --> 03:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
you cannot have treatment limitations on
 
03:42:31.429 --> 03:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
autism okay i understand that thank you
 
03:42:33.670 --> 03:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
representative abel
 
03:42:38.229 --> 03:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:39.950 --> 03:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
are there other
 
03:42:44.710 --> 03:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:48.229 --> 03:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
besides autism that have
 
03:42:48.239 --> 03:42:49.510 align:start position:0%
besides autism that have
um

03:42:49.510 --> 03:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:49.520 --> 03:42:51.269 align:start position:0%
um
have

03:42:51.269 --> 03:42:51.279 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:42:52.870 --> 03:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
caps on them
 
03:42:55.750 --> 03:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
um or is autism the only one i just
 
03:42:58.950 --> 03:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
wondered if i wondered if it needs to be
 
03:43:00.389 --> 03:43:00.399 align:start position:0%
broader than
 
03:43:01.830 --> 03:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
just one
 
03:43:01.840 --> 03:43:04.070 align:start position:0%
just one
particular

03:43:04.070 --> 03:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
particular
 
03:43:06.550 --> 03:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
this particular statute here is specific
 
03:43:08.150 --> 03:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
to autism
 
03:43:10.150 --> 03:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
i see so we don't have but do we have do
 
03:43:11.110 --> 03:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:43:11.990 --> 03:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
do we
 
03:43:12.000 --> 03:43:12.950 align:start position:0%
do we
i'm

03:43:12.950 --> 03:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
03:43:14.630 --> 03:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
i wonder if you could let us know later
 
03:43:16.790 --> 03:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
or something if there are others
 
03:43:18.950 --> 03:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh that we might have to come back and
 
03:43:20.550 --> 03:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
address in the future
 
03:43:22.870 --> 03:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
so that if if that's the case we could
 
03:43:25.349 --> 03:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
do it all now
 
03:43:28.309 --> 03:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
so um this is a health insurance mandate
 
03:43:30.790 --> 03:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
that didn't get passed while i was here
 
03:43:30.800 --> 03:43:31.510 align:start position:0%
that didn't get passed while i was here
and

03:43:31.510 --> 03:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:43:32.710 --> 03:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
i was
 
03:43:34.710 --> 03:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:43:36.630 --> 03:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
the limitations were put in because what
 
03:43:39.030 --> 03:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
this was this was a mandate that
 
03:43:40.790 --> 03:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
insurance companies have to reimburse
 
03:43:43.590 --> 03:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
the school district
 
03:43:47.110 --> 03:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
and so at that time to make it
 
03:43:50.710 --> 03:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
seemed less of a minimize the mandate
 
03:43:52.469 --> 03:43:52.479 align:start position:0%
that that
 
03:43:54.950 --> 03:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
these dollar amounts were put in
 
03:43:58.229 --> 03:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
so yes this is the only only
 
03:43:58.239 --> 03:43:59.830 align:start position:0%
so yes this is the only only
mental

03:43:59.830 --> 03:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
mental
 
03:44:02.790 --> 03:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
disability men health insurance mandate
 
03:44:05.429 --> 03:44:05.439 align:start position:0%
that we have and and yes it would be the
 
03:44:07.030 --> 03:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
only one with all the limits and the
 
03:44:08.469 --> 03:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
reason i say that is that because
 
03:44:10.309 --> 03:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of other statutes that
 
03:44:12.550 --> 03:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
have dollar limits like hearing aids
 
03:44:14.229 --> 03:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
have adult limit
 
03:44:16.950 --> 03:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
medical durable goods have a
 
03:44:18.630 --> 03:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
dollar amount limitations so there are
 
03:44:20.710 --> 03:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
plenty of other you know limitations but
 
03:44:23.510 --> 03:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
in this case this was related to just
 
03:44:23.520 --> 03:44:24.309 align:start position:0%
in this case this was related to just
this

03:44:24.309 --> 03:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:44:27.990 --> 03:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh mandate and it was uh and that was
 
03:44:30.389 --> 03:44:30.399 align:start position:0%
what was passed here in new hampshire
 
03:44:33.990 --> 03:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
yes and in the mental health statute the
 
03:44:34.000 --> 03:44:35.429 align:start position:0%
yes and in the mental health statute the
chapter

03:44:35.429 --> 03:44:35.439 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
03:44:38.389 --> 03:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
417 e this is the only one that has
 
03:44:40.950 --> 03:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
those limits but in other statutes for
 
03:44:44.469 --> 03:44:44.479 align:start position:0%
other mandates there could be
 
03:44:44.479 --> 03:44:46.070 align:start position:0%
other mandates there could be
okay

03:44:46.070 --> 03:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:44:48.870 --> 03:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very oh representative pilo
 
03:44:51.590 --> 03:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair my question is um did
 
03:44:55.030 --> 03:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
you ask for this bill to be
 
03:45:04.469 --> 03:45:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:04.479 --> 03:45:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:45:05.750 --> 03:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:08.309 --> 03:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
my question is um on the very first
 
03:45:11.110 --> 03:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
change i see that a sentence was removed
 
03:45:12.870 --> 03:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
that says such examination and
 
03:45:15.030 --> 03:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
evaluation shall include provider
 
03:45:16.790 --> 03:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
reimbursement practices is there a
 
03:45:21.189 --> 03:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:24.309 --> 03:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
so provider reimbursement practices are
 
03:45:24.319 --> 03:45:25.269 align:start position:0%
so provider reimbursement practices are
one

03:45:25.269 --> 03:45:25.279 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:45:28.389 --> 03:45:28.399 align:start position:0%
nqtl but there are many others we didn't
 
03:45:30.229 --> 03:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
want to be limited to looking just at
 
03:45:31.990 --> 03:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
provider reimbursements we didn't want
 
03:45:34.389 --> 03:45:34.399 align:start position:0%
to imply that that's the only nqtl we
 
03:45:37.269 --> 03:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
would be looking at
 
03:45:38.950 --> 03:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
but the mental parity exam we just
 
03:45:40.950 --> 03:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
completed was specific to provider
 
03:45:40.960 --> 03:45:43.269 align:start position:0%
completed was specific to provider
reimbursement

03:45:43.269 --> 03:45:43.279 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
03:45:46.469 --> 03:45:46.479 align:start position:0%
yes for the question we inquire uh um
 
03:45:50.229 --> 03:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
i think it's really important that that
 
03:45:52.469 --> 03:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
stays there because that's been
 
03:45:56.870 --> 03:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:58.710 --> 03:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
other discussions on other
 
03:46:00.309 --> 03:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
things i would hate to think that we
 
03:46:02.070 --> 03:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
would go through this and not provide
 
03:46:03.510 --> 03:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
that information
 
03:46:05.590 --> 03:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
and i think without it being in statute
 
03:46:07.429 --> 03:46:07.439 align:start position:0%
it could
 
03:46:09.590 --> 03:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
could be passed by so
 
03:46:09.600 --> 03:46:10.550 align:start position:0%
could be passed by so
um

03:46:10.550 --> 03:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:14.950 --> 03:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
there are other sections of rsa 417 e1
 
03:46:17.510 --> 03:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
that do include specific requirements
 
03:46:19.750 --> 03:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
for provider reimbursement okay so
 
03:46:21.910 --> 03:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
amending this particular section i don't
 
03:46:25.429 --> 03:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
think is going to cause that problem but
 
03:46:27.189 --> 03:46:27.199 align:start position:0%
we can look at amending language if
 
03:46:27.199 --> 03:46:29.670 align:start position:0%
we can look at amending language if
necessary

03:46:29.670 --> 03:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
03:46:31.670 --> 03:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:46:35.429 --> 03:46:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:37.189 --> 03:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
all right does anybody else would like
 
03:46:40.630 --> 03:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
to testify on 373
 
03:46:40.640 --> 03:46:41.590 align:start position:0%
to testify on 373
uh

03:46:41.590 --> 03:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:46:45.030 --> 03:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
i have a jake berry from new futures in
 
03:46:48.150 --> 03:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:50.630 --> 03:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
and we have the blue sheets that turned
 
03:46:50.640 --> 03:46:53.910 align:start position:0%
and we have the blue sheets that turned
white

03:46:53.910 --> 03:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:53.920 --> 03:46:55.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:46:55.510 --> 03:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:46:59.670 --> 03:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
so 373 had six people in support and no
 
03:47:01.429 --> 03:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
none a post
 
03:47:03.269 --> 03:47:03.279 align:start position:0%
and with that i will close the public
 
03:47:07.830 --> 03:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:07.840 --> 03:50:54.630 align:start position:0%
 
yep

03:50:54.630 --> 03:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:54.640 --> 03:51:09.830 align:start position:0%
 
25

03:51:09.830 --> 03:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:11.429 --> 03:51:11.439 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
03:51:13.269 --> 03:51:13.279 align:start position:0%
the committee i promise this will be my
 
03:51:14.870 --> 03:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
third and final bad for senator bradley
 
03:51:16.950 --> 03:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
we expect senator soucy to come over for
 
03:51:18.550 --> 03:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
the next bill
 
03:51:19.910 --> 03:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
my name is grant bosse from the new
 
03:51:21.990 --> 03:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire senate here to introduce
 
03:51:24.630 --> 03:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
senate bill 385 fn on behalf of senator
 
03:51:27.189 --> 03:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
jeb bradley its prime sponsor
 
03:51:28.710 --> 03:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
this bill was filed at the request of
 
03:51:30.790 --> 03:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
the banking industry to help combat the
 
03:51:32.229 --> 03:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
financial exploitation of senior
 
03:51:32.239 --> 03:51:33.429 align:start position:0%
financial exploitation of senior
citizens

03:51:33.429 --> 03:51:33.439 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
03:51:36.309 --> 03:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
and other vulnerable individuals
 
03:51:38.550 --> 03:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
financial exploitation can be very hard
 
03:51:40.710 --> 03:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
to detect but even if
 
03:51:43.189 --> 03:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
a local bank suspects that something is
 
03:51:44.550 --> 03:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
wrong that somebody is being taken
 
03:51:46.790 --> 03:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
advantage of they lack the authority to
 
03:51:49.429 --> 03:51:49.439 align:start position:0%
do anything about it to notify anybody
 
03:51:51.269 --> 03:51:51.279 align:start position:0%
that they think one of their customers
 
03:51:54.309 --> 03:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
is uh being taken advantage of
 
03:51:56.070 --> 03:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
if passed this bill would give financial
 
03:51:58.950 --> 03:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
institutions the ability to place a
 
03:52:01.110 --> 03:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
short-term hold on the disbursement of
 
03:52:03.750 --> 03:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
funds if they thought exploited activity
 
03:52:06.469 --> 03:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
had occurred in committee senators
 
03:52:08.229 --> 03:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
worked with the banking department hhs
 
03:52:10.550 --> 03:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
the ag's office the banking industry to
 
03:52:12.710 --> 03:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
address some technical concerns and
 
03:52:15.429 --> 03:52:15.439 align:start position:0%
deliver a bill that they think is
 
03:52:18.229 --> 03:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
ready for your consideration
 
03:52:19.670 --> 03:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
in committee this received the support
 
03:52:21.670 --> 03:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
of 54 people
 
03:52:23.670 --> 03:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
for it none against
 
03:52:25.830 --> 03:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
nobody opposed the bill
 
03:52:27.750 --> 03:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the process it was just a
 
03:52:28.950 --> 03:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
matter of
 
03:52:30.550 --> 03:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
sanding and polishing to get it into the
 
03:52:32.950 --> 03:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
shape it is now i would defer questions
 
03:52:35.670 --> 03:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
to the industry and to the departments i
 
03:52:36.950 --> 03:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
would add that there was an amendment
 
03:52:38.790 --> 03:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
adding a reporting requirement asking
 
03:52:41.030 --> 03:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
those departments to report to you to
 
03:52:42.950 --> 03:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
the senate to the governor how many of
 
03:52:45.429 --> 03:52:45.439 align:start position:0%
these exploitation reports have taken
 
03:52:47.670 --> 03:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
place and what steps if any they
 
03:52:49.269 --> 03:52:49.279 align:start position:0%
recommend to
 
03:52:51.510 --> 03:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
further prevent financial exploitation

direct experiences with financial
 
03:54:14.550 --> 03:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
exploitation and how this bill can help
 
03:54:16.630 --> 03:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
our association represents 38 member
 
03:54:19.269 --> 03:54:19.279 align:start position:0%
banks who employ roughly 6 000 employees
 
03:54:21.269 --> 03:54:21.279 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and we're here today in
 
03:54:23.189 --> 03:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
strong support of the bill
 
03:54:25.990 --> 03:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
this legislation is very closely modeled
 
03:54:28.309 --> 03:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
after a bill that was filed in 2019
 
03:54:30.229 --> 03:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
senate bill 252
 
03:54:32.309 --> 03:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
and that legislation enabled broker
 
03:54:35.750 --> 03:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
dealers to delay disbursement of funds
 
03:54:38.309 --> 03:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
if they suspected financial exploitation
 
03:54:40.630 --> 03:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
that bill had broad support and was
 
03:54:43.189 --> 03:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
signed into law by governor sununu
 
03:54:45.349 --> 03:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
this legislation would allow a bank to
 
03:54:46.950 --> 03:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
delay disbursement of funds from an
 
03:54:49.349 --> 03:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
account of an eligible adult or an
 
03:54:51.830 --> 03:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
account from a beneficiary if they if
 
03:54:54.229 --> 03:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
they suspects if they suspect financial
 
03:54:56.950 --> 03:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
exploitation is occurring
 
03:54:58.469 --> 03:54:58.479 align:start position:0%
the bank would have to provide written
 
03:54:59.910 --> 03:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
notice to the department of health and
 
03:55:02.309 --> 03:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
human services and they would copy the
 
03:55:04.550 --> 03:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
banking department on that notice not
 
03:55:06.309 --> 03:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
more than two days after the delay has
 
03:55:08.150 --> 03:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
taken place
 
03:55:10.229 --> 03:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
the bill defines an eligible adult as
 
03:55:13.349 --> 03:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
someone who is 65 years of age or older
 
03:55:15.590 --> 03:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
or 18 years of
 
03:55:17.990 --> 03:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
age or older who is vulnerable and the
 
03:55:19.590 --> 03:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
the term vulnerable is defined in
 
03:55:19.600 --> 03:55:20.790 align:start position:0%
the term vulnerable is defined in
statute

03:55:20.790 --> 03:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:55:22.389 --> 03:55:22.399 align:start position:0%
which i have in my testimony that
 
03:55:24.950 --> 03:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully you have a copy of
 
03:55:24.960 --> 03:55:26.389 align:start position:0%
hopefully you have a copy of
um

03:55:26.389 --> 03:55:26.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:29.189 --> 03:55:29.199 align:start position:0%
and i also just want to point out that
 
03:55:29.199 --> 03:55:30.229 align:start position:0%
and i also just want to point out that
under

03:55:30.229 --> 03:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
under
 
03:55:32.309 --> 03:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
rsa 161f
 
03:55:34.790 --> 03:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
banks already notify health and human
 
03:55:37.189 --> 03:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
services when financial exploitation is
 
03:55:37.199 --> 03:55:38.469 align:start position:0%
services when financial exploitation is
suspected

03:55:38.469 --> 03:55:38.479 align:start position:0%
suspected
 
03:55:40.389 --> 03:55:40.399 align:start position:0%
and this would require an additional
 
03:55:42.389 --> 03:55:42.399 align:start position:0%
written notice if there is a delay
 
03:55:45.189 --> 03:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
in the disbursement of funds
 
03:55:46.790 --> 03:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
and so i'm happy to answer any questions
 
03:55:48.550 --> 03:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
but i do want to let brad take a few
 
03:55:50.630 --> 03:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
moments and share what he some of his
 
03:55:50.640 --> 03:55:53.189 align:start position:0%
moments and share what he some of his
experiences

03:55:53.189 --> 03:55:53.199 align:start position:0%

banking experience and i have seen
 
03:56:12.550 --> 03:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
prevented or attempted to prevent
 
03:56:14.150 --> 03:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
multiple occurrences of financial
 
03:56:14.160 --> 03:56:15.590 align:start position:0%
multiple occurrences of financial
exploitation

03:56:15.590 --> 03:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
exploitation
 
03:56:17.670 --> 03:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
imagine yourselves sitting in the living
 
03:56:17.680 --> 03:56:18.469 align:start position:0%
imagine yourselves sitting in the living
room

03:56:18.469 --> 03:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
room
 
03:56:20.550 --> 03:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
of an elderly customer
 
03:56:22.630 --> 03:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
asking questions of their finances and
 
03:56:24.229 --> 03:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
how it has come to be that they are
 
03:56:27.349 --> 03:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
writing their grandson checks that
 
03:56:29.910 --> 03:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
appear to be altered but yet ultimately
 
03:56:32.710 --> 03:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
approved by them
 
03:56:34.630 --> 03:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
seeing a father
 
03:56:37.030 --> 03:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
take what we feel is advantage of their
 
03:56:39.670 --> 03:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
vulnerable 20-something son
 
03:56:41.189 --> 03:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
having him withdraw money from his
 
03:56:43.670 --> 03:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
savings account leaving pennies
 
03:56:46.309 --> 03:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
and giving that money to his dad
 
03:56:48.150 --> 03:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
and watching a mother who feels bad for
 
03:56:50.229 --> 03:56:50.239 align:start position:0%
her son that has found himself in legal
 
03:56:50.239 --> 03:56:51.349 align:start position:0%
her son that has found himself in legal
trouble

03:56:51.349 --> 03:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
03:56:53.910 --> 03:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
draining her life savings just to
 
03:56:55.590 --> 03:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
support him
 
03:56:57.750 --> 03:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
i have done this multiple times
 
03:56:59.990 --> 03:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
it is heartbreaking and frustrating to
 
03:57:01.670 --> 03:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
have to explain to someone that their
 
03:57:02.870 --> 03:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
loved ones
 
03:57:04.950 --> 03:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
appear to be taking advantage of them
 
03:57:08.630 --> 03:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
through coercion or altering of checks
 
03:57:10.389 --> 03:57:10.399 align:start position:0%
we report these suspicious these
 
03:57:12.469 --> 03:57:12.479 align:start position:0%
suspicions to the state in hopes that
 
03:57:14.229 --> 03:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
the situation can be investigated in
 
03:57:17.189 --> 03:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
timely manner but ultimately
 
03:57:20.630 --> 03:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
the timing is a matter of perspective
 
03:57:22.309 --> 03:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
when your life savings is walking out
 
03:57:25.429 --> 03:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
the door timely means now
 
03:57:27.030 --> 03:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would give us the power to
 
03:57:29.030 --> 03:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
delay the release of those funds giving
 
03:57:31.830 --> 03:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
dhhs in the state time to investigate
 
03:57:33.990 --> 03:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
our observations
 
03:57:37.110 --> 03:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
exploitation extends beyond loved ones
 
03:57:39.110 --> 03:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
there are countless number of scams in
 
03:57:41.349 --> 03:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
society preying on the vulnerable a
 
03:57:44.070 --> 03:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
common one is a grandparent receiving a
 
03:57:46.389 --> 03:57:46.399 align:start position:0%
call that their grandchild is in jail
 
03:57:48.870 --> 03:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
and that they need to be bailed out
 
03:57:51.429 --> 03:57:51.439 align:start position:0%
through knowledge gained by social media
 
03:57:53.910 --> 03:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
the scammer is able to convince the
 
03:57:55.750 --> 03:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
grandparent of the story
 
03:57:57.670 --> 03:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
the scammer then requests a wire to be
 
03:57:59.670 --> 03:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
sent typically in the thousands of
 
03:58:02.070 --> 03:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
dollars once the wire is sent the money
 
03:58:04.469 --> 03:58:04.479 align:start position:0%
is gone
 
03:58:06.150 --> 03:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
and rarely recovered
 
03:58:07.910 --> 03:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
in one instance we had a customer
 
03:58:10.150 --> 03:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
approach us for such a wire
 
03:58:12.309 --> 03:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
we asked many questions as our staff is
 
03:58:13.750 --> 03:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
trained to do so
 
03:58:16.229 --> 03:58:16.239 align:start position:0%
we advise the customer of the known scam
 
03:58:17.590 --> 03:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
in the area
 
03:58:19.750 --> 03:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
the customer insisted they spoke with
 
03:58:21.030 --> 03:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
their grandson
 
03:58:23.830 --> 03:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely certain it was their grandson
 
03:58:25.750 --> 03:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
and the money was sent
 
03:58:28.550 --> 03:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
a couple hours later
 
03:58:31.510 --> 03:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
he returned to the bank realizing it was
 
03:58:32.950 --> 03:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
a scam
 
03:58:34.950 --> 03:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it was too late the money
 
03:58:36.790 --> 03:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
was gone
 
03:58:39.590 --> 03:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
yes as bankers our role is to facilitate
 
03:58:41.189 --> 03:58:41.199 align:start position:0%
the movement of money
 
03:58:43.189 --> 03:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
but as community bankers and stewards of
 
03:58:45.030 --> 03:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
our communities i feel we have an
 
03:58:46.630 --> 03:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
obligation to protect our most
 
03:58:48.469 --> 03:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
vulnerable vulnerable population from
 
03:58:51.910 --> 03:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
financial exploitation sb 385 adds a
 
03:58:54.870 --> 03:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
tool which helps us accomplish that
 
03:58:56.790 --> 03:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
i would much rather apologize to a
 
03:58:58.790 --> 03:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
customer for delaying the release of
 
03:58:58.800 --> 03:59:00.309 align:start position:0%
customer for delaying the release of
funds

03:59:00.309 --> 03:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:59:02.550 --> 03:59:02.560 align:start position:0%
than to explain to them
 
03:59:05.349 --> 03:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
why we let the situation just occur
 
03:59:08.229 --> 03:59:08.239 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your support
 
03:59:10.950 --> 03:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
i also have a copy of my testimony
 
03:59:10.960 --> 03:59:12.950 align:start position:0%
i also have a copy of my testimony
okay

03:59:12.950 --> 03:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:59:15.830 --> 03:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
are you a co-sponsor
 
03:59:17.189 --> 03:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
i realized
 
03:59:21.030 --> 03:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:23.189 --> 03:59:23.199 align:start position:0%
when i was looking through this
 
03:59:26.790 --> 03:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
i did not see anything about
 
03:59:28.950 --> 03:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
a trust account
 
03:59:30.630 --> 03:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
where the two
 
03:59:33.510 --> 03:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
major trustees are over 65
 
03:59:35.269 --> 03:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
but the
 
03:59:38.070 --> 03:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
the sons grandsons granddaughters are
 
03:59:41.429 --> 03:59:41.439 align:start position:0%
also part of the trust does this address
 
03:59:43.590 --> 03:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
anything about the
 
03:59:45.189 --> 03:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
the trust
 
03:59:46.469 --> 03:59:46.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:59:47.750 --> 03:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for co-sponsoring the
 
03:59:49.349 --> 03:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
legislation um
 
03:59:51.670 --> 03:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
regarding your question we have not had
 
03:59:53.830 --> 03:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
any specific discussions about the trust
 
03:59:56.309 --> 03:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
i don't believe the bill specifically
 
03:59:58.469 --> 03:59:58.479 align:start position:0%
addresses trusts i would have to go back
 
03:59:59.830 --> 03:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative and just double check to
 
04:00:00.950 --> 04:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
04:00:03.189 --> 04:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
it may be included in this but we have
 
04:00:04.630 --> 04:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
not had specific discussions about
 
04:00:05.910 --> 04:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
trusts but
 
04:00:09.670 --> 04:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
the intent is really to try to address
 
04:00:12.229 --> 04:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
any disbursement that a bank may hold
 
04:00:13.910 --> 04:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
but i i just want to get back to you on
 
04:00:16.870 --> 04:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
your question if that's okay
 
04:00:19.590 --> 04:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
 
04:00:22.309 --> 04:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and i i
 
04:00:24.229 --> 04:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
can empathize with this bill we had an
 
04:00:25.910 --> 04:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
issue with my mother-in-law
 
04:00:27.670 --> 04:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
so i can understand it but you had
 
04:00:31.670 --> 04:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned that reporting it to dhhs
 
04:00:32.710 --> 04:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
what about
 
04:00:34.950 --> 04:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
um reporting it to somebody else that's
 
04:00:36.469 --> 04:00:36.479 align:start position:0%
on the account like my mother-in-law had
 
04:00:37.990 --> 04:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
my sister-in-law on the account but they
 
04:00:40.070 --> 04:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
weren't contacting my sister-in-law to
 
04:00:41.670 --> 04:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
let her know
 
04:00:44.229 --> 04:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
um would that be a better step than
 
04:00:46.790 --> 04:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
immediately going to dhhs with it
 
04:00:48.389 --> 04:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
looking to see who else was on the
 
04:00:48.399 --> 04:00:50.229 align:start position:0%
looking to see who else was on the
accounts

04:00:50.229 --> 04:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
04:00:51.910 --> 04:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative johnson for
 
04:00:54.229 --> 04:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
your comment for your question um we
 
04:00:56.150 --> 04:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
have had a lot of conversations with the
 
04:00:57.830 --> 04:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
banking department and health and human
 
04:01:00.070 --> 04:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
services and the attorney general's
 
04:01:01.349 --> 04:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
office who believe they're all
 
04:01:03.510 --> 04:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
represented today we've had very good
 
04:01:05.349 --> 04:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
conversations about that but we've had
 
04:01:06.870 --> 04:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
discussions about the right way to do
 
04:01:06.880 --> 04:01:07.830 align:start position:0%
discussions about the right way to do
that

04:01:07.830 --> 04:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:01:10.950 --> 04:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
the process in hhs is existing today and
 
04:01:13.189 --> 04:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
it's been around for quite some time
 
04:01:14.469 --> 04:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
there are folks here that could probably
 
04:01:15.750 --> 04:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
speak to that process a little bit
 
04:01:16.950 --> 04:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
better and how that came about and if
 
04:01:18.790 --> 04:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
that should be different we did explore
 
04:01:18.800 --> 04:01:19.670 align:start position:0%
that should be different we did explore
different

04:01:19.670 --> 04:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:01:22.229 --> 04:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
avenues of going about that but
 
04:01:24.550 --> 04:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
knowing we really tried to very closely
 
04:01:26.309 --> 04:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
mirror this off of the existing
 
04:01:28.790 --> 04:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
securities language and so we that
 
04:01:30.150 --> 04:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
that's why we have the process that we
 
04:01:32.469 --> 04:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
have today um but i don't know brad do
 
04:01:34.070 --> 04:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to that in terms of
 
04:01:37.830 --> 04:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
notifying people before hhs in in i i
 
04:01:37.840 --> 04:01:38.870 align:start position:0%
notifying people before hhs in in i i
can

04:01:38.870 --> 04:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:01:41.269 --> 04:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
speak from our perspective at the
 
04:01:43.030 --> 04:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
merrimack that yes there have been
 
04:01:46.070 --> 04:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
occasions where we do reach out to uh
 
04:01:48.790 --> 04:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
joint account holders um
 
04:01:51.189 --> 04:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
to make sure or powers of attorneys to
 
04:01:52.469 --> 04:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
to make them aware because that's the
 
04:01:54.150 --> 04:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
right thing to do and and to help
 
04:01:56.229 --> 04:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
protect so um you know obviously our
 
04:01:57.990 --> 04:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
first reaction is not to jump right to
 
04:02:00.630 --> 04:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
hhs and and share the information
 
04:02:03.110 --> 04:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
but is to identify and educate and and
 
04:02:05.429 --> 04:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
hopefully resolve it um but as we see
 
04:02:06.870 --> 04:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
patterns grow
 
04:02:09.189 --> 04:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
and then we get a feeling of the level
 
04:02:11.110 --> 04:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
of exploitation is where we begin to
 
04:02:12.309 --> 04:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
escalate that
 
04:02:13.750 --> 04:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
um and then share the information with
 
04:02:15.750 --> 04:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
the state in hopes they get the support
 
04:02:18.550 --> 04:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
to take care of our customer
 
04:02:20.150 --> 04:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
for the question being claire
 
04:02:22.469 --> 04:02:22.479 align:start position:0%
so you so most banks
 
04:02:25.349 --> 04:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
and i i think my local bank also did the
 
04:02:25.359 --> 04:02:26.309 align:start position:0%
and i i think my local bank also did the
same

04:02:26.309 --> 04:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
same
 
04:02:29.110 --> 04:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
you're first in incline is to reach out
 
04:02:31.110 --> 04:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
to other people that may be on the
 
04:02:31.120 --> 04:02:32.389 align:start position:0%
to other people that may be on the
account

04:02:32.389 --> 04:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
account
 
04:02:33.750 --> 04:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
as long as they're not the ones you're
 
04:02:35.590 --> 04:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
questioning but
 
04:02:36.950 --> 04:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
you're going to reach out to them before
 
04:02:39.590 --> 04:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
you start going or calling dhhs and
 
04:02:41.670 --> 04:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
that's kind of your standard practice i
 
04:02:44.309 --> 04:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
would say just as a common courtesy as a
 
04:02:45.990 --> 04:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
common courtesy when we can identify
 
04:02:47.750 --> 04:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
that corrects
 
04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
and i would like to add to um
 
04:02:50.710 --> 04:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
representative we've heard from our
 
04:02:52.710 --> 04:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
other uh banking members too who have
 
04:02:54.710 --> 04:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
said that it's not this is not something
 
04:02:57.349 --> 04:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
that happens right away they observe the
 
04:02:59.429 --> 04:02:59.439 align:start position:0%
patterns and it's after they see
 
04:03:01.110 --> 04:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
repeated patterns that's been happening
 
04:03:03.830 --> 04:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
for a while um and that's when they they
 
04:03:05.429 --> 04:03:05.439 align:start position:0%
start to reach out to other members on
 
04:03:06.790 --> 04:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
the account and to reach out to health
 
04:03:08.550 --> 04:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
and human services but um they do
 
04:03:10.229 --> 04:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
observe the patterns for a while it's uh
 
04:03:12.150 --> 04:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
it's not it's something that they don't
 
04:03:17.030 --> 04:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:18.950 --> 04:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
did you ever
 
04:03:18.960 --> 04:03:20.229 align:start position:0%
did you ever
okay

04:03:20.229 --> 04:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:03:23.269 --> 04:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
representative mclaren thank you um just
 
04:03:25.269 --> 04:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
a question it seems to me that this
 
04:03:27.349 --> 04:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
could be a little bit tricky trying to
 
04:03:29.189 --> 04:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
make a decision
 
04:03:31.030 --> 04:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
are there cases where
 
04:03:35.110 --> 04:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
the bank has uh has proceeded with a
 
04:03:37.750 --> 04:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
sending a check out that in fact it
 
04:03:39.830 --> 04:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
bounces back on you and you've been held
 
04:03:39.840 --> 04:03:41.910 align:start position:0%
bounces back on you and you've been held
liable

04:03:41.910 --> 04:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
liable
 
04:03:45.269 --> 04:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
in other words you maybe made a mistake
 
04:03:47.030 --> 04:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
you want to take that or
 
04:03:47.040 --> 04:03:48.469 align:start position:0%
you want to take that or
um

04:03:48.469 --> 04:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:51.510 --> 04:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
what i can tell you is um there there is
 
04:03:53.110 --> 04:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
there is language in the legislation to
 
04:03:56.389 --> 04:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
try to address immunity um uh
 
04:03:58.630 --> 04:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
they're trying to protect bankers that
 
04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
are looking at all the evidence in front
 
04:04:01.349 --> 04:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
of them and trying to make the best
 
04:04:02.870 --> 04:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
decision that they can and do so
 
04:04:05.110 --> 04:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
cautiously um and so we have included
 
04:04:06.790 --> 04:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
that language here but brad do you want
 
04:04:08.070 --> 04:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
to speak about how that sort of
 
04:04:10.309 --> 04:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
practically plays out yeah i think that
 
04:04:11.750 --> 04:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
there there are definitely occasions
 
04:04:14.070 --> 04:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
where things may slip through the cracks
 
04:04:16.950 --> 04:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
um and then it it boils back to
 
04:04:18.950 --> 04:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
depending upon the level of fraud
 
04:04:20.630 --> 04:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
or exploitation where
 
04:04:22.870 --> 04:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
the bank does take the loss
 
04:04:24.790 --> 04:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
on an item that is paid
 
04:04:26.710 --> 04:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
to make the customer whole
 
04:04:26.720 --> 04:04:27.830 align:start position:0%
to make the customer whole
so

04:04:27.830 --> 04:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:04:30.790 --> 04:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:33.429 --> 04:04:33.439 align:start position:0%
representative herbert
 
04:04:35.910 --> 04:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
um is there a system in well first of
 
04:04:38.710 --> 04:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
all uh who do you call first
 
04:04:40.550 --> 04:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
in other words if you have a problem you
 
04:04:42.150 --> 04:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
you think you have a problem
 
04:04:44.630 --> 04:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
who is it that you call
 
04:04:46.150 --> 04:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:04:48.229 --> 04:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
it's a great question so my staff as
 
04:04:50.550 --> 04:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
they're trained when they i identify
 
04:04:52.630 --> 04:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
what they believe are observed to be
 
04:04:55.590 --> 04:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
behaviors that are signs of exploitation
 
04:04:57.510 --> 04:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh actually reach out to me um and run
 
04:04:59.910 --> 04:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
the scenario through through me um and
 
04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
from there we have an internal risk
 
04:05:03.429 --> 04:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
department that i begin to engage at
 
04:05:04.870 --> 04:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
that point
 
04:05:07.189 --> 04:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
bring them up to speed the details of
 
04:05:08.790 --> 04:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
the situation
 
04:05:10.870 --> 04:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
what is what's going on
 
04:05:12.710 --> 04:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
and then the ultimate
 
04:05:14.790 --> 04:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
reaching out to the state if necessary
 
04:05:16.790 --> 04:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
is done through our harvest department
 
04:05:19.670 --> 04:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
that may vary from from bank to bank
 
04:05:21.510 --> 04:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
for the question is it the attorney
 
04:05:22.870 --> 04:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
04:05:25.750 --> 04:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
consumer protection that you would call
 
04:05:28.389 --> 04:05:28.399 align:start position:0%
um after brad's he mentioned that you
 
04:05:30.790 --> 04:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
know they his their process internally
 
04:05:33.510 --> 04:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
at the merrimack county savings bank
 
04:05:33.520 --> 04:05:35.110 align:start position:0%
at the merrimack county savings bank
once

04:05:35.110 --> 04:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
once
 
04:05:36.950 --> 04:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
family members have been contacted and
 
04:05:38.630 --> 04:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
once you've talked to the customer and
 
04:05:40.469 --> 04:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
the issue is still there it would go the
 
04:05:42.710 --> 04:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
way that the process exists today in rsa
 
04:05:44.550 --> 04:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
161 f as it goes to health and human
 
04:05:46.630 --> 04:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
services and health and human services
 
04:05:48.309 --> 04:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
at that point there is a law enforcement
 
04:05:49.910 --> 04:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
component that gets to the attorney
 
04:05:51.269 --> 04:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
04:05:53.110 --> 04:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
but i can't speak to how that works but
 
04:05:55.030 --> 04:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
it does get to them at some level but
 
04:05:57.269 --> 04:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
hhs works with them after the bank has
 
04:05:58.790 --> 04:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
communicated with health and human
 
04:06:01.030 --> 04:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
services in the first instance
 
04:06:03.189 --> 04:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
really question main choir so is there a
 
04:06:05.830 --> 04:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
system whereby you can flag an account
 
04:06:08.229 --> 04:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
and and the other
 
04:06:11.590 --> 04:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies are notified
 
04:06:13.349 --> 04:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
because if speed is of the essence i
 
04:06:14.950 --> 04:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
would think that you would want
 
04:06:16.950 --> 04:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
everybody to know you've got your eye on
 
04:06:16.960 --> 04:06:17.910 align:start position:0%
everybody to know you've got your eye on
something

04:06:17.910 --> 04:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:06:20.870 --> 04:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
there there are measures in place for us
 
04:06:23.349 --> 04:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
to put alerts on accounts
 
04:06:24.710 --> 04:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
if we feel
 
04:06:24.720 --> 04:06:25.429 align:start position:0%
if we feel
a

04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:06:27.349 --> 04:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
potential transactions need to be viewed
 
04:06:29.030 --> 04:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
more closely
 
04:06:29.040 --> 04:06:30.229 align:start position:0%
more closely
um

04:06:30.229 --> 04:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:32.389 --> 04:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
and then from there it's we typically
 
04:06:34.469 --> 04:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
would direct if reports have already
 
04:06:36.790 --> 04:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
been filed internally
 
04:06:39.349 --> 04:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
additional items or observations at that
 
04:06:41.110 --> 04:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
point at least for us
 
04:06:42.630 --> 04:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
are pushed to that appropriate
 
04:06:44.469 --> 04:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
department internally
 
04:06:48.469 --> 04:06:48.479 align:start position:0%

the banking department uh just wanted to
 
04:07:29.510 --> 04:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
briefly note that the department is
 
04:07:31.349 --> 04:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the language of this
 
04:07:33.750 --> 04:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
bill and worked with
 
04:07:35.349 --> 04:07:35.359 align:start position:0%

04:07:43.189 --> 04:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
might have of the banking department but
 
04:07:44.870 --> 04:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to briefly
 
04:07:48.389 --> 04:07:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:49.910 --> 04:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative greeson that's the
 
04:07:49.920 --> 04:07:50.790 align:start position:0%
uh representative greeson that's the
question

04:07:50.790 --> 04:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:07:51.990 --> 04:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you again
 
04:07:54.630 --> 04:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
for for testifying uh and and i saved my
 
04:07:56.309 --> 04:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
question for the banking department
 
04:07:57.910 --> 04:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
because you may have a little more
 
04:07:59.590 --> 04:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
familiarity with it
 
04:08:02.710 --> 04:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh this is a new section that this list
 
04:08:05.990 --> 04:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
is new section and i want to make sure
 
04:08:09.110 --> 04:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
that uh somewhere if it because it's not
 
04:08:10.550 --> 04:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
stated in here
 
04:08:13.429 --> 04:08:13.439 align:start position:0%
in this new section but somewhere in rsa
 
04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
um that where there is an opportunity
 
04:08:20.309 --> 04:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
we know who is manipulating
 
04:08:22.149 --> 04:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
the adult or the person with the with
 
04:08:23.269 --> 04:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
the money in there too
 
04:08:25.990 --> 04:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
a family member whomever um is there
 
04:08:28.550 --> 04:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
something in statute now that
 
04:08:30.950 --> 04:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
provides for the restitution of those
 
04:08:32.950 --> 04:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
funds that have been taken plus any
 
04:08:35.110 --> 04:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
penalties and stuff to make that person
 
04:08:36.469 --> 04:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
whole again understanding the phone
 
04:08:38.469 --> 04:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
scams we can't really do much about but
 
04:08:39.590 --> 04:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
when we actually know who the
 
04:08:41.590 --> 04:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
perpetrator is is that anywhere in
 
04:08:43.269 --> 04:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
statute because i know it's not in here
 
04:08:45.269 --> 04:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
it's not within our banking laws so our
 
04:08:47.269 --> 04:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in this case would be over
 
04:08:49.670 --> 04:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
the financial institutions sadly not
 
04:08:51.349 --> 04:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
over the bad actors but that is where
 
04:08:52.950 --> 04:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's
 
04:08:54.870 --> 04:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
um office comes into play under the
 
04:08:57.429 --> 04:08:57.439 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act as well as and i
 
04:08:58.790 --> 04:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
know there's a representative here from
 
04:09:00.309 --> 04:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office who can
 
04:09:02.309 --> 04:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
speak further but in these instances
 
04:09:03.750 --> 04:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
where we have seen this we've referred
 
04:09:05.830 --> 04:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
this on immediately to the ag's office
 
04:09:08.950 --> 04:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:10.630 --> 04:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative fargo
 
04:09:12.790 --> 04:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
um when i'm reading the fiscal note
 
04:09:15.110 --> 04:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and when
 
04:09:17.429 --> 04:09:17.439 align:start position:0%
i'm reading the fiscal note um
 
04:09:19.269 --> 04:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
i guess the banking department had
 
04:09:20.950 --> 04:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
weighed in on this and they would need
 
04:09:23.910 --> 04:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
two additional staff to support this so
 
04:09:26.149 --> 04:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
um that was with the prior version of
 
04:09:28.950 --> 04:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
the original version of the bell had um
 
04:09:30.630 --> 04:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
the banking department instead of being
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
copied on it more so regularly involved
 
04:09:33.840 --> 04:09:34.630 align:start position:0%
copied on it more so regularly involved
in

04:09:34.630 --> 04:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:09:36.389 --> 04:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
actually the determination of whether or
 
04:09:39.269 --> 04:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
not uh disbursement should um time frame
 
04:09:41.590 --> 04:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
should extend the hold should extend and
 
04:09:43.349 --> 04:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
we felt in that case if we were going to
 
04:09:45.830 --> 04:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
be as intricately involved in
 
04:09:47.510 --> 04:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
those investigations we would require
 
04:09:49.110 --> 04:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
additional staff but with the amended
 
04:09:51.189 --> 04:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
version it removes that so that we are
 
04:09:53.990 --> 04:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
copied and notified and kept
 
04:09:55.750 --> 04:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
in lieu of everything going on in the
 
04:09:58.149 --> 04:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
process but would not require additional
 
04:10:00.229 --> 04:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
staff there is the possibility
 
04:10:01.750 --> 04:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
further consumer complaints could come
 
04:10:03.830 --> 04:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
into our office whether from the actual
 
04:10:05.830 --> 04:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
individual who owns the account or the
 
04:10:07.110 --> 04:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
person who
 
04:10:09.349 --> 04:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
is trying to receive the funds
 
04:10:11.910 --> 04:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
but we believe at that time this time
 
04:10:13.750 --> 04:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
our resources would be able to manage
 
04:10:16.389 --> 04:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
that and we have the help of the dhhs
 
04:10:17.750 --> 04:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
would be they can answer questions
 
04:10:18.710 --> 04:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
further involvement to their
 
04:10:20.950 --> 04:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
investigation along with the ag's office
 
04:10:22.790 --> 04:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
okay so you don't anticipate any
 
04:10:24.950 --> 04:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
additional cost because i know you're
 
04:10:26.710 --> 04:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
self-funded so it would mean that you'd
 
04:10:28.469 --> 04:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
have to try to recoup that car yeah
 
04:10:30.070 --> 04:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
you're saying at this point there
 
04:10:31.990 --> 04:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be any at this point with the
 
04:10:34.309 --> 04:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
new this amended version of the bill we
 
04:10:36.830 --> 04:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:38.710 --> 04:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
proceed okay
 
04:10:39.830 --> 04:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
richard said you have a question you're
 
04:10:41.990 --> 04:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
also no i don't get it
 
04:10:43.110 --> 04:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:10:45.510 --> 04:10:45.520 align:start position:0%

assault and neglect of the elderly
 
04:11:37.590 --> 04:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
04:11:39.670 --> 04:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
over my three years as a prosecutor in
 
04:11:40.870 --> 04:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
the unit
 
04:11:43.110 --> 04:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
we've worked closely with the department
 
04:11:45.030 --> 04:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
of health and human services
 
04:11:47.590 --> 04:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
the bureau of elderly and adult services
 
04:11:50.149 --> 04:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
we receive referrals from them that stem
 
04:11:52.550 --> 04:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
from the mandatory reporting laws
 
04:11:54.630 --> 04:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
we investigate investigate those cases
 
04:11:57.030 --> 04:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
and prosecute those cases
 
04:11:59.189 --> 04:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
what we also do is we also
 
04:11:59.199 --> 04:12:00.389 align:start position:0%
what we also do is we also
counsel

04:12:00.389 --> 04:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
04:12:02.550 --> 04:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
and educate individuals throughout this
 
04:12:03.910 --> 04:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
state and
 
04:12:07.189 --> 04:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
attempt to prev protect them from scams
 
04:12:09.670 --> 04:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
um scams are running rampant
 
04:12:12.229 --> 04:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
especially in covid times and there's
 
04:12:15.189 --> 04:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
only so much we can do
 
04:12:16.950 --> 04:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
so with this bill
 
04:12:19.510 --> 04:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh it would give the banks
 
04:12:22.149 --> 04:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to step in uh and
 
04:12:23.910 --> 04:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
protect the elderly throughout this
 
04:12:23.920 --> 04:12:24.790 align:start position:0%
protect the elderly throughout this
state

04:12:24.790 --> 04:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:12:27.189 --> 04:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
um often we see individuals only after
 
04:12:29.910 --> 04:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
the money is gone long gone
 
04:12:31.670 --> 04:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing we can do about it
 
04:12:33.750 --> 04:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
with the exception of course ordering
 
04:12:35.429 --> 04:12:35.439 align:start position:0%
restitution if there's someone that we
 
04:12:37.830 --> 04:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
can prosecute and even then they don't
 
04:12:40.070 --> 04:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
have the funds to repay it
 
04:12:41.269 --> 04:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:12:43.510 --> 04:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
we've investigated and prosecuted cases
 
04:12:45.670 --> 04:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
of grandparent scams and the one thing
 
04:12:47.510 --> 04:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
that we hear from victims in those cases
 
04:12:48.950 --> 04:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
is that they wish
 
04:12:50.389 --> 04:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh the banks could have done a little
 
04:12:51.910 --> 04:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
bit more
 
04:12:53.830 --> 04:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
as well as they have done
 
04:12:55.269 --> 04:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
they're limited they can only ask so
 
04:12:56.790 --> 04:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
many questions they can't actually stop
 
04:12:58.389 --> 04:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
the transaction
 
04:13:00.710 --> 04:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
and so this would give them that ability
 
04:13:02.550 --> 04:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
and so in that respect we uh we fully
 
04:13:03.750 --> 04:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
support the bill
 
04:13:09.830 --> 04:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:13.910 --> 04:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:17.349 --> 04:13:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:19.269 --> 04:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
and thank you for testifying
 
04:13:20.790 --> 04:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
um and i understand this is a
 
04:13:22.870 --> 04:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
significant issue that uh as people get
 
04:13:24.790 --> 04:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
up in years they need maybe a little bit
 
04:13:26.790 --> 04:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
of oversight over their their decision
 
04:13:26.800 --> 04:13:27.830 align:start position:0%
of oversight over their their decision
making

04:13:27.830 --> 04:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
making
 
04:13:29.830 --> 04:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
what um
 
04:13:31.349 --> 04:13:31.359 align:start position:0%
what would happen if there was say a
 
04:13:34.229 --> 04:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
false positive that that um
 
04:13:36.550 --> 04:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
so so the inverse of that someone is
 
04:13:39.349 --> 04:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
fully corpus mentis they have
 
04:13:40.950 --> 04:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
their decision-making ability but
 
04:13:43.269 --> 04:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
something about the transaction
 
04:13:45.510 --> 04:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
triggers the bank to step in and stop a
 
04:13:47.269 --> 04:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
valid transaction
 
04:13:48.870 --> 04:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a mortgage payment maybe it's
 
04:13:51.910 --> 04:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
some some important transaction
 
04:13:53.670 --> 04:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
what would be the recourse for that
 
04:13:53.680 --> 04:13:55.030 align:start position:0%
what would be the recourse for that
person

04:13:55.030 --> 04:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:13:57.110 --> 04:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
to uh you know
 
04:14:00.149 --> 04:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
be personally restituted if
 
04:14:01.830 --> 04:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
if the bank stepped in when it shouldn't
 
04:14:04.149 --> 04:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
have how would that process work
 
04:14:05.830 --> 04:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not exactly sure how that process
 
04:14:07.269 --> 04:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
would work this certainly provides
 
04:14:09.429 --> 04:14:09.439 align:start position:0%
immunity for uh the banks if they are
 
04:14:11.429 --> 04:14:11.439 align:start position:0%
making those decisions in good faith so
 
04:14:13.510 --> 04:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
there would have to be a good faith um
 
04:14:16.309 --> 04:14:16.319 align:start position:0%
reason why the bank was withholding uh
 
04:14:18.710 --> 04:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
the payment
 
04:14:20.309 --> 04:14:20.319 align:start position:0%
so so in that case they would they would
 
04:14:23.510 --> 04:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
be immune as my understanding um but if
 
04:14:25.030 --> 04:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
there was some sort of bad faith and
 
04:14:27.750 --> 04:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
they withheld the payment without
 
04:14:29.990 --> 04:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
sufficient evidence uh then there they
 
04:14:32.389 --> 04:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
could be liable as my understanding um
 
04:14:34.149 --> 04:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
for repayment
 
04:14:35.590 --> 04:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh they are they are tasked with
 
04:14:37.670 --> 04:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
investigating whether there is uh
 
04:14:40.309 --> 04:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
financial exploitation uh swiftly under
 
04:14:42.309 --> 04:14:42.319 align:start position:0%
the bill um and so perhaps they could
 
04:14:43.750 --> 04:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
call the mortgage company that wouldn't
 
04:14:45.590 --> 04:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
take very long at all um and that could
 
04:14:47.269 --> 04:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
be settled very quickly so i think it
 
04:14:49.030 --> 04:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
would be uh the extremely rare case
 
04:14:50.630 --> 04:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
where where you're hypothetical uh came
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:14:53.030 --> 04:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to take liberty for a
 
04:14:54.870 --> 04:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up um sure
 
04:14:56.950 --> 04:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
so this would protect the banks from
 
04:14:59.429 --> 04:14:59.439 align:start position:0%
liability um
 
04:15:00.550 --> 04:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:15:02.149 --> 04:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
the term good faith is a very loaded
 
04:15:04.149 --> 04:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
term how who determines what is good
 
04:15:05.670 --> 04:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
faith and uh
 
04:15:07.910 --> 04:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of people have automated uh
 
04:15:09.030 --> 04:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
payments that they don't really pay
 
04:15:10.870 --> 04:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
attention to because it's monthly
 
04:15:12.950 --> 04:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
automated and you might not find out
 
04:15:15.269 --> 04:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
right away that a payment was missed
 
04:15:16.870 --> 04:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
but uh to the question of good faith who
 
04:15:18.790 --> 04:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
determines that i can just speak
 
04:15:21.269 --> 04:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
generally um about good faith um you
 
04:15:22.790 --> 04:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
know in the court systems um but
 
04:15:24.229 --> 04:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
theoretically it would be uh it would be
 
04:15:25.349 --> 04:15:25.359 align:start position:0%
a court that would that would make a
 
04:15:26.950 --> 04:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
determination as to whether there's uh
 
04:15:28.790 --> 04:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
good faith or not good faith any sort of
 
04:15:30.950 --> 04:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh liability for payment would be my
 
04:15:33.670 --> 04:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
understanding again um that's just sort
 
04:15:33.680 --> 04:15:34.710 align:start position:0%
understanding again um that's just sort
of

04:15:34.710 --> 04:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:15:36.389 --> 04:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the way that would
 
04:15:36.399 --> 04:15:39.830 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the way that would
operate

04:15:39.830 --> 04:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:43.590 --> 04:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:45.510 --> 04:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr townsend for your testimony
 
04:15:48.870 --> 04:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:50.389 --> 04:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
04:15:50.399 --> 04:15:51.670 align:start position:0%
let's see
see

04:15:51.670 --> 04:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
see
 
04:16:10.229 --> 04:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:12.710 --> 04:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
so good afternoon to the chair and the
 
04:16:14.710 --> 04:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
04:16:18.149 --> 04:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
kathy harvard i'm from hanover
 
04:16:20.469 --> 04:16:20.479 align:start position:0%
i'm here speaking in my own capacity as
 
04:16:23.189 --> 04:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
a long-time alzheimer's advocate and a
 
04:16:25.110 --> 04:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
long-time volunteer with the alzheimer's
 
04:16:25.120 --> 04:16:26.550 align:start position:0%
long-time volunteer with the alzheimer's
association

04:16:26.550 --> 04:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
association
 
04:16:28.469 --> 04:16:28.479 align:start position:0%
and i thank you very much for allowing
 
04:16:31.269 --> 04:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
me to testify today in support of senate
 
04:16:33.110 --> 04:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
bill 385
 
04:16:34.950 --> 04:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
relative to financial exploitation of
 
04:16:37.269 --> 04:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
vulnerable adults and most specifically
 
04:16:39.750 --> 04:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
how that pertains to those battling
 
04:16:43.030 --> 04:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
demand alzheimer's and other dementias
 
04:16:45.110 --> 04:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
so today i'm actually the voice of more
 
04:16:47.830 --> 04:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
than 26 thousand people here in the
 
04:16:49.990 --> 04:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
granite state who are suffering from
 
04:16:51.750 --> 04:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
some form of dementia
 
04:16:55.110 --> 04:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
and they're 57 000 caregivers this is
 
04:16:57.030 --> 04:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
just new hampshire
 
04:16:58.790 --> 04:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
i'm also these are the people who care
 
04:17:00.790 --> 04:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
for them every single day
 
04:17:03.030 --> 04:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
who manage their lives as the disease
 
04:17:03.040 --> 04:17:04.630 align:start position:0%
who manage their lives as the disease
progresses

04:17:04.630 --> 04:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
progresses
 
04:17:06.550 --> 04:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
and i do this because i'm honoring my
 
04:17:08.389 --> 04:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
husband i was a caregiver myself for
 
04:17:11.189 --> 04:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
more than 10 years and so all of us i
 
04:17:13.590 --> 04:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
think feel that
 
04:17:15.110 --> 04:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:17:17.429 --> 04:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
would help provide a guard rail
 
04:17:19.750 --> 04:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
additional protection for our families
 
04:17:21.189 --> 04:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
to safeguard
 
04:17:23.590 --> 04:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
our very most vulnerable family members
 
04:17:25.990 --> 04:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
from exploitation
 
04:17:27.510 --> 04:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
most of you are aware that alzheimer's
 
04:17:29.590 --> 04:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
begins rather silently like a thief in
 
04:17:32.070 --> 04:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
the night it's very very slowly and
 
04:17:34.550 --> 04:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
quietly steals away a person's cognitive
 
04:17:34.560 --> 04:17:35.750 align:start position:0%
quietly steals away a person's cognitive
abilities

04:17:35.750 --> 04:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
abilities
 
04:17:37.429 --> 04:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
and their ultimately their ability to
 
04:17:39.030 --> 04:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
live independently
 
04:17:42.229 --> 04:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
it's notoriously difficult to diagnose
 
04:17:44.630 --> 04:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
for everybody for the doctors for family
 
04:17:46.870 --> 04:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
members and family members are very
 
04:17:48.950 --> 04:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
frequently not even aware that their
 
04:17:51.830 --> 04:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
loved one is having difficulty managing
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
some of the most basic elements of
 
04:17:55.429 --> 04:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
independent living
 
04:17:58.070 --> 04:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
until a problem arises and then it's too
 
04:17:58.080 --> 04:17:59.590 align:start position:0%
until a problem arises and then it's too
late

04:17:59.590 --> 04:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
late
 
04:18:02.149 --> 04:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
in a rapidly aging state like ours where
 
04:18:04.309 --> 04:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
many seniors are already living alone
 
04:18:07.269 --> 04:18:07.279 align:start position:0%
and families far away it's clear that we
 
04:18:09.830 --> 04:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
need to provide some sort of mechanisms
 
04:18:12.550 --> 04:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
to safeguard our most vulnerable and
 
04:18:14.790 --> 04:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
certainly that at the top of that list
 
04:18:16.630 --> 04:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
would certainly be those suffering from
 
04:18:18.710 --> 04:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's and other dementia
 
04:18:21.910 --> 04:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's is a progressive always
 
04:18:24.469 --> 04:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
fatal neurodegenerative disease that
 
04:18:26.950 --> 04:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
causes a gradual decline in memory
 
04:18:29.510 --> 04:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
thinking and reasoning skills in the
 
04:18:31.590 --> 04:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
early stages we might see memory loss
 
04:18:34.149 --> 04:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
that interferes with daily living maybe
 
04:18:37.670 --> 04:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
difficulty completing familiar tasks
 
04:18:40.149 --> 04:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
and decreased judgment
 
04:18:40.159 --> 04:18:41.429 align:start position:0%
and decreased judgment
alzheimer's

04:18:41.429 --> 04:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's
 
04:18:44.070 --> 04:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
symptoms only get worse over time and it
 
04:18:45.670 --> 04:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
impairs judgment
 
04:18:48.630 --> 04:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
and often puts individuals at very real
 
04:18:51.830 --> 04:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
risk for rejecting help and making poor
 
04:18:51.840 --> 04:18:53.349 align:start position:0%
risk for rejecting help and making poor
decisions

04:18:53.349 --> 04:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
04:18:55.750 --> 04:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
cognitive decline associated with
 
04:18:57.670 --> 04:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's frequently leads to
 
04:19:01.110 --> 04:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
difficulty in managing personal finances
 
04:19:03.910 --> 04:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
sadly forgetting to pay bills bouncing
 
04:19:06.710 --> 04:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
checks large and unexplained decreases
 
04:19:08.790 --> 04:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
in a bank balance these are often one of
 
04:19:11.670 --> 04:19:11.680 align:start position:0%
the very first ways that families even
 
04:19:14.309 --> 04:19:14.319 align:start position:0%
become aware of the severity of their
 
04:19:17.429 --> 04:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
loved one's cognitive decline
 
04:19:19.590 --> 04:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
so this puts people with alzheimer's or
 
04:19:21.670 --> 04:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
another form of dementia at greater risk
 
04:19:25.189 --> 04:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
for financial exploitation or fraud
 
04:19:27.590 --> 04:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
financial exploitation typically occurs
 
04:19:29.990 --> 04:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
through theft or scams are there forms
 
04:19:31.750 --> 04:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
of elder exploitation
 
04:19:34.229 --> 04:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
and it's because we know that their
 
04:19:36.790 --> 04:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
trust has been abused different others
 
04:19:38.630 --> 04:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
who are scamming them feel either
 
04:19:40.870 --> 04:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
financial entitlement or the ability to
 
04:19:43.429 --> 04:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
coerce those who are more vulnerable it
 
04:19:45.110 --> 04:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
could come via a telephone call an
 
04:19:47.429 --> 04:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
internet offer a knock on the door by a
 
04:19:48.870 --> 04:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
stranger or as we've heard a little
 
04:19:53.189 --> 04:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:55.670 --> 04:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
one in five older americans is has been
 
04:19:57.670 --> 04:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
a victim or is a victim of financial
 
04:20:00.630 --> 04:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
exploitation and in 2020 older adults
 
04:20:02.229 --> 04:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
across the u s
 
04:20:05.189 --> 04:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
filed more than 334 thousand fraud
 
04:20:05.199 --> 04:20:06.309 align:start position:0%
filed more than 334 thousand fraud
reports

04:20:06.309 --> 04:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
reports
 
04:20:09.750 --> 04:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
with reported losses of 600 million
 
04:20:11.510 --> 04:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
because victims of financial
 
04:20:13.990 --> 04:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
exploitation are often reluctant to
 
04:20:15.670 --> 04:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
report abuse
 
04:20:17.990 --> 04:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
or they lack the physical or cognitive
 
04:20:20.790 --> 04:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
capacity to report it or perhaps they
 
04:20:23.510 --> 04:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
fear retaliation or reluctant to have
 
04:20:25.830 --> 04:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
their abuser
 
04:20:25.840 --> 04:20:27.269 align:start position:0%
their abuser
prosecuted

04:20:27.269 --> 04:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
prosecuted
 
04:20:29.910 --> 04:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
or perhaps they wish to avoid potential
 
04:20:29.920 --> 04:20:31.349 align:start position:0%
or perhaps they wish to avoid potential
embarrassment

04:20:31.349 --> 04:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
embarrassment
 
04:20:33.750 --> 04:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of fraud is never even reported so
 
04:20:36.630 --> 04:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
these numbers are really only a fraction
 
04:20:39.189 --> 04:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
of what and the extent of harm that
 
04:20:41.030 --> 04:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
happens to older adults in general but
 
04:20:42.389 --> 04:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
even more so
 
04:20:44.469 --> 04:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
those suffering from cognitive decline
 
04:20:46.070 --> 04:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
through alzheimer's or another form of
 
04:20:46.080 --> 04:20:47.750 align:start position:0%
through alzheimer's or another form of
dementia

04:20:47.750 --> 04:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
dementia
 
04:20:47.760 --> 04:20:48.590 align:start position:0%
dementia
by

04:20:48.590 --> 04:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:20:51.429 --> 04:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
2025 the grant number of granite staters
 
04:20:53.110 --> 04:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
living with alzheimer's will have
 
04:20:55.910 --> 04:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
increased from today by 23 percent
 
04:20:58.389 --> 04:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
now we'll have 32 000
 
04:21:00.630 --> 04:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
folks who are actively suffering from
 
04:21:02.389 --> 04:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
some sort of dementia
 
04:21:04.550 --> 04:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
in our state and these numbers will
 
04:21:07.189 --> 04:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
continue to grow until we do find a way
 
04:21:08.790 --> 04:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
to cure or prevent these dreaded
 
04:21:08.800 --> 04:21:10.870 align:start position:0%
to cure or prevent these dreaded
diseases

04:21:10.870 --> 04:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
04:21:12.630 --> 04:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
because as these numbers grow
 
04:21:15.110 --> 04:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
opportunities for financial exploitation
 
04:21:18.469 --> 04:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
only increase we ask your support
 
04:21:21.349 --> 04:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
for this senate bill 385 to help ensure
 
04:21:23.269 --> 04:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
that those who are living with cognitive
 
04:21:25.189 --> 04:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
impairment in new hampshire
 
04:21:27.990 --> 04:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
are safe from financial abuse
 
04:21:30.309 --> 04:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
by allowing banks and other financial
 
04:21:32.710 --> 04:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
institutions the ability to place a hold
 
04:21:34.710 --> 04:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
on distribution of funds that they
 
04:21:37.429 --> 04:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
suspect where financial exploitation may
 
04:21:39.830 --> 04:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
be at risk it may be happening
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
we're building a guard rail we're
 
04:21:43.990 --> 04:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
building a safety net to help protect
 
04:21:46.469 --> 04:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
some of our communities most vulnerable
 
04:21:49.510 --> 04:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
adults from a financial exploitation
 
04:21:51.030 --> 04:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your support for this
 
04:21:54.389 --> 04:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:54.399 --> 04:21:56.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:21:56.630 --> 04:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:21:58.710 --> 04:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
oh representative mclaren has a question
 
04:22:00.550 --> 04:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh thank you well thank you for
 
04:22:02.950 --> 04:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh testifying today
 
04:22:04.710 --> 04:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
in your experience
 
04:22:06.870 --> 04:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
um let's say you have a situation where
 
04:22:09.750 --> 04:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
a spouse or maybe a parent has uh
 
04:22:12.469 --> 04:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
has cognitive disabilities
 
04:22:15.189 --> 04:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
is there any way that a the other spouse
 
04:22:17.429 --> 04:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
or a child can step in
 
04:22:20.149 --> 04:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
in a less formal way than let's say a
 
04:22:22.229 --> 04:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
getting a power of attorney or a court
 
04:22:24.870 --> 04:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
order to to basically make sure that
 
04:22:26.950 --> 04:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
everything goes through them is there a
 
04:22:29.830 --> 04:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
way to do that facilitate that
 
04:22:31.510 --> 04:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
well i'm i'm not i don't want to give
 
04:22:33.429 --> 04:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
you a legal interpretation but i can
 
04:22:36.870 --> 04:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
give you the family uh interpretation of
 
04:22:38.710 --> 04:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
what happens most frequently before you
 
04:22:40.149 --> 04:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
get to that point
 
04:22:42.870 --> 04:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:45.110 --> 04:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
making a legal determination of someone
 
04:22:48.229 --> 04:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
who will be the executor
 
04:22:51.910 --> 04:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
it is an ongoing negotiation as the
 
04:22:54.550 --> 04:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
person's cognitive abilities decline and
 
04:22:54.560 --> 04:22:55.189 align:start position:0%
person's cognitive abilities decline and
it

04:22:55.189 --> 04:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:22:57.269 --> 04:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
it is very tricky it is very tricky
 
04:22:59.910 --> 04:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
indeed and so oftentimes it might be in
 
04:23:01.590 --> 04:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
the medical context but it could also be
 
04:23:04.309 --> 04:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
in the banking context the family member
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
who is if they're available who is
 
04:23:08.389 --> 04:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
looking after their loved one will also
 
04:23:10.469 --> 04:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
will look for the support
 
04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
of somebody in that other institution to
 
04:23:15.750 --> 04:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
help them manage their loved ones
 
04:23:18.790 --> 04:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
medical care or their financial care and
 
04:23:20.870 --> 04:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
so any kind of safeguards that can help
 
04:23:23.030 --> 04:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
them do that will be appreciated because
 
04:23:25.349 --> 04:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
it's a very long road it's a very long
 
04:23:27.590 --> 04:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
disease the average time could be 10 12
 
04:23:27.600 --> 04:23:28.389 align:start position:0%
disease the average time could be 10 12
years

04:23:28.389 --> 04:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:23:29.750 --> 04:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
and there are many years where we're
 
04:23:32.070 --> 04:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
simply seeing impaired judgment
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
before we get to that point of making
 
04:23:35.349 --> 04:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
legal change
 
04:23:37.510 --> 04:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
so safeguards that can help
 
04:23:40.070 --> 04:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
put on a break before a disaster happens
 
04:23:41.750 --> 04:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
even in the early stages it's a really
 
04:23:45.110 --> 04:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:45.120 --> 04:23:47.189 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:23:47.189 --> 04:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:23:49.349 --> 04:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
ribs and burrows thank you i'll be brief
 
04:23:50.790 --> 04:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
and this is a would you believe my
 
04:23:53.110 --> 04:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
mother had alzheimer's and it was
 
04:23:56.229 --> 04:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
similar scenarios that you described
 
04:23:58.229 --> 04:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
my mother who's incredibly bright woman
 
04:24:00.149 --> 04:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
hired a caretaker who approached her in
 
04:24:02.389 --> 04:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
the parking lot of a hospital which she
 
04:24:04.309 --> 04:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
would never ever have done
 
04:24:07.910 --> 04:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
had she not been her mind been failing
 
04:24:10.070 --> 04:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
with no references this woman stole
 
04:24:10.080 --> 04:24:11.110 align:start position:0%
with no references this woman stole
money

04:24:11.110 --> 04:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:24:13.830 --> 04:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
computers um jewelry
 
04:24:13.840 --> 04:24:15.110 align:start position:0%
computers um jewelry
and

04:24:15.110 --> 04:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:24:16.630 --> 04:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
we found out that my mother wasn't
 
04:24:17.990 --> 04:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
paying bills only because my brother
 
04:24:20.149 --> 04:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
went through it and so because we had
 
04:24:22.790 --> 04:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
these signs my brother was able to
 
04:24:24.790 --> 04:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
convince my parents that that he should
 
04:24:26.550 --> 04:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
have power of attorney but i think one
 
04:24:28.309 --> 04:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
of the problems is people who don't have
 
04:24:30.229 --> 04:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
actively involved children
 
04:24:32.870 --> 04:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
or who don't have children um so i just
 
04:24:33.990 --> 04:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to share that because that
 
04:24:35.429 --> 04:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
concerns me
 
04:24:39.670 --> 04:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:41.670 --> 04:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:24:44.630 --> 04:24:44.640 align:start position:0%

04:25:00.870 --> 04:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt and members of the house
 
04:25:02.710 --> 04:25:02.720 align:start position:0%

this is a collaborative effort we have
 
04:25:31.670 --> 04:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
to thank in direct appreciation to ms
 
04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
merrill over with the new hampshire
 
04:25:35.030 --> 04:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
bankers association she worked very
 
04:25:36.950 --> 04:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
collaboratively in the way to do best
 
04:25:38.710 --> 04:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
legislation to reach out to state
 
04:25:38.720 --> 04:25:39.910 align:start position:0%
legislation to reach out to state
agencies

04:25:39.910 --> 04:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
04:25:41.590 --> 04:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
the banking department the department of

04:25:46.550 --> 04:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
the legislation that's before you
 
04:25:48.469 --> 04:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
this has been road tested as ms merrill
 
04:25:51.189 --> 04:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
had mentioned because this uh a similar
 
04:25:53.910 --> 04:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
bill uh that this is basically
 
04:25:55.910 --> 04:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
the architecture you'll see is senate
 
04:25:58.550 --> 04:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
bill 252 and that was relative to also
 
04:26:01.030 --> 04:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
financial exploitation of the elderly
 
04:26:03.269 --> 04:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
and it provided the same type of
 
04:26:05.990 --> 04:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
framework as it relates to financial
 
04:26:08.309 --> 04:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
advisors um and it was brought at the
 
04:26:10.790 --> 04:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
request in 2019 and enacted in law in
 
04:26:12.790 --> 04:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
the same year by the secretary of
 
04:26:14.389 --> 04:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
state's office through their bureau of
 
04:26:17.110 --> 04:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
securities so this bill that you see
 
04:26:19.269 --> 04:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
before you we strongly support we think
 
04:26:21.670 --> 04:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
it advances the goals of protecting the
 
04:26:24.149 --> 04:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
vulnerable citizens that uh miss uh
 
04:26:25.910 --> 04:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
lincoln and her group at our adult
 
04:26:27.590 --> 04:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
protective services support and we're
 
04:26:29.750 --> 04:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
here to answer any questions from the
 
04:26:29.760 --> 04:26:33.510 align:start position:0%
here to answer any questions from the
committee

04:26:33.510 --> 04:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:33.520 --> 04:26:34.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:26:34.389 --> 04:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:26:40.389 --> 04:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:43.429 --> 04:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
all right so i have no more cards and
 
04:26:46.229 --> 04:26:46.239 align:start position:0%

04:27:06.560 --> 04:28:53.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:28:53.670 --> 04:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:53.680 --> 04:28:54.550 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:28:54.550 --> 04:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:28:56.229 --> 04:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
senator cc
 
04:28:56.239 --> 04:28:57.670 align:start position:0%
senator cc
okay

04:28:57.670 --> 04:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:28:59.910 --> 04:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
i will
 
04:29:02.830 --> 04:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
open up the hearing on senate bill 210.
 
04:29:06.710 --> 04:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
um one of the great things uh or
 
04:29:07.990 --> 04:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
was great but
 
04:29:10.389 --> 04:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
this opportunity where we're in this big
 
04:29:12.149 --> 04:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
committee room and we're sharing our
 
04:29:13.510 --> 04:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
committee rooms that
 
04:29:14.710 --> 04:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
is that uh
 
04:29:14.720 --> 04:29:16.149 align:start position:0%
is that uh
tuesdays

04:29:16.149 --> 04:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
tuesdays
 
04:29:18.070 --> 04:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
where commerce house commerce committee
 
04:29:19.429 --> 04:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
does not meet
 
04:29:21.349 --> 04:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
and so therefore i have an opportunity
 
04:29:22.710 --> 04:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
to watch
 
04:29:24.950 --> 04:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
the senate conference committee
 
04:29:27.349 --> 04:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
and uh much relieved to see that this
 
04:29:29.670 --> 04:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
bill has been fixed
 
04:29:32.550 --> 04:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
so that we do not have the huge turnout
 
04:29:35.750 --> 04:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
that the senate was very fortunate to
 
04:29:35.760 --> 04:29:37.110 align:start position:0%
that the senate was very fortunate to
have

04:29:37.110 --> 04:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:29:39.189 --> 04:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
so and i will introduce senator susie
 
04:29:41.110 --> 04:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
from manchester who will introduce the
 
04:29:41.120 --> 04:29:43.429 align:start position:0%
from manchester who will introduce the
bill

04:29:43.429 --> 04:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:45.429 --> 04:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
to us
 
04:29:47.830 --> 04:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon senator good
 
04:29:49.590 --> 04:29:49.600 align:start position:0%

committee for the record i'm donna soucy

i represent senate district 18 comprised
 
04:29:57.910 --> 04:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
of the town of litchfield and five wards
 
04:30:00.389 --> 04:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
in the city of manchester
 
04:30:03.269 --> 04:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
i'm here on behalf of senator bradley
 
04:30:05.670 --> 04:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
and myself as a co-sponsor senator
 
04:30:08.469 --> 04:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
bradley sends his apologies
 
04:30:10.950 --> 04:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
but really i worked quite a bit with
 
04:30:13.429 --> 04:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
senator bradley on this legislation
 
04:30:15.910 --> 04:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
particularly in crafting the amendment
 
04:30:18.229 --> 04:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
which replaced the bill
 
04:30:21.429 --> 04:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
and i think we have reached what is a
 
04:30:23.830 --> 04:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
good compromise and i'm happy to present
 
04:30:25.110 --> 04:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
that here
 
04:30:26.469 --> 04:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
for you today
 
04:30:29.349 --> 04:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
first senator bradley um wanted you to
 
04:30:31.750 --> 04:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
know that it was conversations with many
 
04:30:33.510 --> 04:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
people that reside in manufactured
 
04:30:35.510 --> 04:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
housing parks that led him to sponsor
 
04:30:38.870 --> 04:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
this bill um in particular mrs louise
 
04:30:41.189 --> 04:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
ride out who you're going to hear from i
 
04:30:43.110 --> 04:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
believe in just a bit
 
04:30:45.510 --> 04:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
and some of the concerns expressed led
 
04:30:48.710 --> 04:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
to the original filing of the bill
 
04:30:50.149 --> 04:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
after that lengthy hearing that you
 
04:30:52.710 --> 04:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
watched mr chairman senator bradley and
 
04:30:54.870 --> 04:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
i had an opportunity to sit down on
 
04:30:56.870 --> 04:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
several occasions
 
04:30:58.469 --> 04:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
with tara reardon from the community
 
04:31:00.309 --> 04:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
loan fund who i believe you will hear
 
04:31:02.309 --> 04:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
from and karen soucy from the new
 
04:31:03.590 --> 04:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire manufactured housing
 
04:31:06.630 --> 04:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
association to work through some of the
 
04:31:08.309 --> 04:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
issues that had been identified and
 
04:31:12.630 --> 04:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
presented to us and to try to negotiate
 
04:31:14.550 --> 04:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
the compromise that is here before you
 
04:31:14.560 --> 04:31:15.590 align:start position:0%
the compromise that is here before you
today

04:31:15.590 --> 04:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:31:17.990 --> 04:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
so i'll just walk you through what the
 
04:31:19.349 --> 04:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
bill does
 
04:31:21.670 --> 04:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
the bill's primary purpose
 
04:31:25.269 --> 04:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
was to encourage greater participation
 
04:31:28.870 --> 04:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
by residents of a park contemplating
 
04:31:30.550 --> 04:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
acquisition and becoming a resident
 
04:31:33.910 --> 04:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
owned community often called a rock
 
04:31:36.870 --> 04:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
so the first section of the bill if you
 
04:31:39.110 --> 04:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
look on the first page
 
04:31:41.670 --> 04:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
you'll see in bold several references to
 
04:31:43.830 --> 04:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
notice being made not only to the new
 
04:31:45.670 --> 04:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire housing finance authority but
 
04:31:47.429 --> 04:31:47.439 align:start position:0%
also to the new hampshire manufactured
 
04:31:50.790 --> 04:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:53.030 --> 04:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
that notice is um
 
04:31:56.790 --> 04:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
limited in scope it's merely um
 
04:31:58.630 --> 04:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
it would exclude price terms and
 
04:32:01.030 --> 04:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
conditions of the offer but it is merely
 
04:32:02.229 --> 04:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
a notice
 
04:32:04.870 --> 04:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
if you turn to the second page um that's
 
04:32:07.110 --> 04:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
where pretty much uh the heart of the
 
04:32:11.349 --> 04:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
legislation is starting on line three
 
04:32:13.990 --> 04:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
the bill provides for
 
04:32:14.000 --> 04:32:15.189 align:start position:0%
the bill provides for
um

04:32:15.189 --> 04:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:17.990 --> 04:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
greater notice
 
04:32:18.000 --> 04:32:18.950 align:start position:0%
greater notice
to

04:32:18.950 --> 04:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:32:20.389 --> 04:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
the tenants
 
04:32:23.830 --> 04:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
currently residing within the park so it
 
04:32:26.149 --> 04:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
requires either a certified letter or we
 
04:32:28.070 --> 04:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
recognized that there were significant
 
04:32:30.630 --> 04:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
costs to that and that might not
 
04:32:32.870 --> 04:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
be sustainable or a verified
 
04:32:34.469 --> 04:32:34.479 align:start position:0%
hand-delivered letter and the
 
04:32:36.710 --> 04:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
verification process we weren't specific
 
04:32:39.189 --> 04:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
on we believed that it could likely be
 
04:32:40.870 --> 04:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
a photograph taken with a cell phone
 
04:32:43.429 --> 04:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
upon delivery of the letter that letter
 
04:32:45.910 --> 04:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
would include the mortgage terms the
 
04:32:48.790 --> 04:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
land rent per homeowner and other costs
 
04:32:51.269 --> 04:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
or fees that would be associated with it
 
04:32:53.349 --> 04:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
but the most important part begins on
 
04:32:55.349 --> 04:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
line six where it says such letters
 
04:32:57.269 --> 04:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
shall include a form to request an
 
04:32:59.590 --> 04:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
absentee vote for or against the
 
04:33:01.510 --> 04:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
purchase of the park
 
04:33:02.870 --> 04:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns that we were
 
04:33:05.670 --> 04:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
attempting to address was that
 
04:33:08.230 --> 04:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
in some instances and i know there are
 
04:33:10.551 --> 04:33:10.561 align:start position:0%
statistics available i'm not going to go
 
04:33:11.590 --> 04:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
through all of them but in some
 
04:33:14.629 --> 04:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
instances you had a very very very small
 
04:33:18.230 --> 04:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
percentage of residents actually
 
04:33:20.551 --> 04:33:20.561 align:start position:0%
participating in the vote to become a
 
04:33:22.310 --> 04:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
resident owned community
 
04:33:25.830 --> 04:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
and it was our feeling that
 
04:33:27.429 --> 04:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
such an acquisition and such a
 
04:33:29.510 --> 04:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
substantial decision
 
04:33:29.520 --> 04:33:30.470 align:start position:0%
substantial decision
should

04:33:30.470 --> 04:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
should
 
04:33:33.830 --> 04:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
be made by a larger group of residents
 
04:33:36.310 --> 04:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
now once again it's like elections we
 
04:33:38.789 --> 04:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
all stand for election some voters
 
04:33:40.709 --> 04:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
choose to exercise their rights some do
 
04:33:43.429 --> 04:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
not the same will be true here
 
04:33:45.670 --> 04:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
but we wanted the absentee process in
 
04:33:47.269 --> 04:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
place to ensure that there weren't
 
04:33:49.750 --> 04:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
obstacles to people being able to go to
 
04:33:51.830 --> 04:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
vote whether it was
 
04:33:54.310 --> 04:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
child care or
 
04:33:57.029 --> 04:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
not wanting to be within the group on
 
04:33:59.429 --> 04:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
many of these facilities do not have
 
04:34:01.510 --> 04:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
actual facilities on premises within the
 
04:34:03.590 --> 04:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
park where a meeting can take place
 
04:34:05.910 --> 04:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
there are costs associated with them
 
04:34:08.709 --> 04:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
leasing space so we felt it important
 
04:34:11.349 --> 04:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
that we at the very least attempt to
 
04:34:13.109 --> 04:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
make the process
 
04:34:15.510 --> 04:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
as open as possible and to inform
 
04:34:18.949 --> 04:34:18.959 align:start position:0%
residents as much as possible
 
04:34:20.869 --> 04:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we did beginning on
 
04:34:23.910 --> 04:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
line seven was to ensure that in order
 
04:34:26.310 --> 04:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
to cast the vote members residents have
 
04:34:29.029 --> 04:34:29.039 align:start position:0%
to become part of the association
 
04:34:31.349 --> 04:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
want to ensure that those association
 
04:34:33.990 --> 04:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
fees are no more than five dollars
 
04:34:36.949 --> 04:34:36.959 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is that we want
 
04:34:38.789 --> 04:34:38.799 align:start position:0%
the residents to have buy-in and you'll
 
04:34:40.470 --> 04:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
hear testimony about
 
04:34:42.390 --> 04:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
the reason for that to become part of
 
04:34:44.949 --> 04:34:44.959 align:start position:0%
the cooperative but also we didn't want
 
04:34:47.830 --> 04:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
the fee to be so high that it once again
 
04:34:49.750 --> 04:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
would preclude someone from being able
 
04:34:51.510 --> 04:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
to cast their vote
 
04:34:53.109 --> 04:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
04:34:54.949 --> 04:34:54.959 align:start position:0%
we wanted to ensure that there was a
 
04:34:56.390 --> 04:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism for
 
04:34:58.869 --> 04:34:58.879 align:start position:0%
fair process open process of counting
 
04:34:59.990 --> 04:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
the votes
 
04:35:02.949 --> 04:35:02.959 align:start position:0%
and then beginning on line 14
 
04:35:05.109 --> 04:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
one of the issues and once again it was
 
04:35:07.349 --> 04:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
only one park that was cited i can't
 
04:35:09.349 --> 04:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
tell you there are any others but in one
 
04:35:11.349 --> 04:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
instance there was a resident community
 
04:35:11.359 --> 04:35:12.390 align:start position:0%
instance there was a resident community
where

04:35:12.390 --> 04:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:35:12.400 --> 04:35:13.429 align:start position:0%
where
those

04:35:13.429 --> 04:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:35:15.910 --> 04:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
tenant those residents who were not part
 
04:35:18.310 --> 04:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
of the association had to pay an
 
04:35:20.070 --> 04:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
additional 200
 
04:35:22.551 --> 04:35:22.561 align:start position:0%
a month in rental fees
 
04:35:25.269 --> 04:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
and given that we view manufactured
 
04:35:27.349 --> 04:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
housing as potentially another form of
 
04:35:29.910 --> 04:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
affordable housing the concern was that
 
04:35:32.150 --> 04:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
there needed to be some restraint on how
 
04:35:35.109 --> 04:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
much you could charge therefore on lines
 
04:35:38.150 --> 04:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
14 and 15 you see uh the language
 
04:35:39.670 --> 04:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
limiting it to
 
04:35:41.990 --> 04:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
no more than 25 if there's going to be
 
04:35:43.910 --> 04:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
that distinction once again that's a
 
04:35:47.349 --> 04:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
determination made by the residents it's
 
04:35:50.070 --> 04:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
a form of their self-governance but it
 
04:35:51.910 --> 04:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
was something that had been
 
04:35:53.510 --> 04:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
been raised and we thought needed to be
 
04:35:53.520 --> 04:35:54.949 align:start position:0%
been raised and we thought needed to be
addressed

04:35:54.949 --> 04:35:54.959 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
04:35:56.629 --> 04:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
the last part
 
04:36:00.310 --> 04:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
that you will see beginning on line 18
 
04:36:00.320 --> 04:36:01.189 align:start position:0%
that you will see beginning on line 18
put

04:36:01.189 --> 04:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
put
 
04:36:02.949 --> 04:36:02.959 align:start position:0%
the language that i mentioned about the
 
04:36:04.470 --> 04:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
five dollar fee
 
04:36:04.480 --> 04:36:05.990 align:start position:0%
five dollar fee
into

04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:36:06.000 --> 04:36:07.349 align:start position:0%
into
the

04:36:07.349 --> 04:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:36:10.230 --> 04:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
corporation statutes so that it's in two
 
04:36:12.230 --> 04:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
places so if somebody is going to look
 
04:36:14.789 --> 04:36:14.799 align:start position:0%
to form such a cooperative they might
 
04:36:17.349 --> 04:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
not go directly to the manufactured
 
04:36:19.830 --> 04:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
housing legislation but if they're going
 
04:36:22.789 --> 04:36:22.799 align:start position:0%
to form a cooperative specific
 
04:36:25.269 --> 04:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
to a manufactured housing park that
 
04:36:27.670 --> 04:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
language is there as well so that it's
 
04:36:30.070 --> 04:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
illustrated that they cannot charge more
 
04:36:33.029 --> 04:36:33.039 align:start position:0%
than the five dollars as i said uh
 
04:36:34.869 --> 04:36:34.879 align:start position:0%
senator bradley and i spent a lot of
 
04:36:37.429 --> 04:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
time we had a lot of good meetings with
 
04:36:41.990 --> 04:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
ms reardon who's here and mrs soucy
 
04:36:45.109 --> 04:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
and we continued to hear from a number
 
04:36:48.949 --> 04:36:48.959 align:start position:0%
of residents throughout this process
 
04:36:51.990 --> 04:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
so this was this was our attempt at a
 
04:36:53.750 --> 04:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
compromise i think it's a reasonable
 
04:36:56.629 --> 04:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
compromise i think it puts in place
 
04:36:58.310 --> 04:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
some very good guard rails for the
 
04:37:00.551 --> 04:37:00.561 align:start position:0%
process it encourages greater
 
04:37:00.561 --> 04:37:02.230 align:start position:0%
process it encourages greater
participation

04:37:02.230 --> 04:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
participation
 
04:37:04.949 --> 04:37:04.959 align:start position:0%
and i hope that for those folks that
 
04:37:04.959 --> 04:37:06.230 align:start position:0%
and i hope that for those folks that
choose

04:37:06.230 --> 04:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
choose
 
04:37:06.240 --> 04:37:07.990 align:start position:0%
choose
to

04:37:07.990 --> 04:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:37:10.551 --> 04:37:10.561 align:start position:0%
become resident owned communities and
 
04:37:12.789 --> 04:37:12.799 align:start position:0%
engage in self-governance
 
04:37:15.429 --> 04:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
it's a better way for them to start and
 
04:37:17.510 --> 04:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's a good way to
 
04:37:20.390 --> 04:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
provide additional affordable housing in
 
04:37:22.709 --> 04:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
our state so with that um i would
 
04:37:24.709 --> 04:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony i'd be happy to
 
04:37:26.390 --> 04:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
answer any questions as i said i know
 
04:37:28.709 --> 04:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
there are others that will follow me
 
04:37:31.109 --> 04:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
that will give you more detail about
 
04:37:33.429 --> 04:37:33.439 align:start position:0%
acquisition and the process and also
 
04:37:35.189 --> 04:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
tell you about specific issues they've
 
04:37:37.109 --> 04:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
encountered so thank you mr chairman
 
04:37:38.869 --> 04:37:38.879 align:start position:0%
thank you we do have a question
 
04:37:40.551 --> 04:37:40.561 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
 
04:37:42.390 --> 04:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:37:42.400 --> 04:37:43.349 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

04:37:43.349 --> 04:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:47.830 --> 04:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
would this impact any of the current
 
04:37:51.510 --> 04:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
as you call them rock or communities to
 
04:37:53.510 --> 04:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
make them follow these rules now or
 
04:37:55.029 --> 04:37:55.039 align:start position:0%
would they be grandfathered to do what
 
04:37:56.551 --> 04:37:56.561 align:start position:0%
they're doing now
 
04:37:57.670 --> 04:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
04:37:59.590 --> 04:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
you know how would we handle
 
04:38:01.429 --> 04:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
before and now
 
04:38:04.310 --> 04:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
so any existing community that is
 
04:38:06.789 --> 04:38:06.799 align:start position:0%
already a residentially owned community
 
04:38:08.709 --> 04:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
would have already cast their vote
 
04:38:11.029 --> 04:38:11.039 align:start position:0%
they'd have their association fee
 
04:38:11.039 --> 04:38:12.390 align:start position:0%
they'd have their association fee
the

04:38:12.390 --> 04:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:38:15.670 --> 04:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
rental portion would apply to those
 
04:38:17.910 --> 04:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
and i think you'll be hearing another
 
04:38:17.920 --> 04:38:18.869 align:start position:0%
and i think you'll be hearing another
bill

04:38:18.869 --> 04:38:18.879 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:38:21.590 --> 04:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
that senator bradley also sponsored
 
04:38:24.230 --> 04:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
requiring additional resolution
 
04:38:26.949 --> 04:38:26.959 align:start position:0%
processes for those tenants that reside
 
04:38:28.869 --> 04:38:28.879 align:start position:0%
in the resident owned communities so
 
04:38:31.429 --> 04:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
those that have already formed resident
 
04:38:33.910 --> 04:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
owned communities would not have that
 
04:38:36.470 --> 04:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
significant impact by this legislation
 
04:38:38.230 --> 04:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
but new resident owned communities going
 
04:38:38.240 --> 04:38:42.070 align:start position:0%
but new resident owned communities going
forward

04:38:42.070 --> 04:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:44.150 --> 04:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative abel
 
04:38:47.910 --> 04:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you senator um
 
04:38:50.310 --> 04:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
you you are very clear and very helpful
 
04:38:53.510 --> 04:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
i i do have uh one question
 
04:38:53.520 --> 04:38:55.670 align:start position:0%
i i do have uh one question
um

04:38:55.670 --> 04:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:55.680 --> 04:38:56.949 align:start position:0%
um
the

04:38:56.949 --> 04:38:56.959 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:38:59.429 --> 04:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
bill the amended bill that we have in
 
04:39:00.789 --> 04:39:00.799 align:start position:0%
front of us
 
04:39:00.799 --> 04:39:01.750 align:start position:0%
front of us
does

04:39:01.750 --> 04:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
does
 
04:39:01.760 --> 04:39:03.109 align:start position:0%
does
mention

04:39:03.109 --> 04:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
mention
 
04:39:05.349 --> 04:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
sale of
 
04:39:08.709 --> 04:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
of a manufactured housing park
 
04:39:11.830 --> 04:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
would this also apply if the owner
 
04:39:14.310 --> 04:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to sell to someone other than the
 
04:39:17.029 --> 04:39:17.039 align:start position:0%
residents or
 
04:39:19.670 --> 04:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
could you please address that so when
 
04:39:19.680 --> 04:39:20.551 align:start position:0%
could you please address that so when
the

04:39:20.551 --> 04:39:20.561 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:39:23.189 --> 04:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
owner intends to sell the residents are
 
04:39:26.230 --> 04:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
given an opportunity
 
04:39:26.240 --> 04:39:27.109 align:start position:0%
given an opportunity
to

04:39:27.109 --> 04:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:39:29.269 --> 04:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
acquire the park there's there's a whole
 
04:39:31.590 --> 04:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
scheme within the statute already for
 
04:39:33.910 --> 04:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
how they go about acquiring the park and
 
04:39:35.670 --> 04:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
it's typically the community loan fund
 
04:39:38.070 --> 04:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
that would assist them in that process
 
04:39:39.590 --> 04:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
and there are certain time frames and
 
04:39:43.750 --> 04:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:45.030 --> 04:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
if i may just
 
04:39:47.590 --> 04:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
mr chairman just along those lines i
 
04:39:50.470 --> 04:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
neglected to add one thing um regarding
 
04:39:50.480 --> 04:39:51.910 align:start position:0%
neglected to add one thing um regarding
this

04:39:51.910 --> 04:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:39:53.750 --> 04:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
when the vote is cast to become a
 
04:39:55.510 --> 04:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
resident owned community it is a simple
 
04:39:58.150 --> 04:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
majority of those participating in
 
04:40:00.310 --> 04:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
person and the absentee ballots i know
 
04:40:01.990 --> 04:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
there was a concern previously that
 
04:40:03.990 --> 04:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
there were certain thresholds and that
 
04:40:05.830 --> 04:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
that would preclude any new resident
 
04:40:07.670 --> 04:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
owned communities this legislation does
 
04:40:09.670 --> 04:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
not include that it's simply a majority
 
04:40:14.550 --> 04:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:15.990 --> 04:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
okay we're all set thank you thank you
 
04:40:17.350 --> 04:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
very much mr chairman good to see you
 
04:40:21.590 --> 04:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:24.310 --> 04:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
okay karen susie from the new hampshire
 
04:40:34.150 --> 04:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:36.628 --> 04:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chair and members of
 
04:40:38.708 --> 04:40:38.718 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:40:40.708 --> 04:40:40.718 align:start position:0%
my name is karen soucy and i am here on
 
04:40:42.310 --> 04:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
behalf of the new hampshire manufactured
 
04:40:44.868 --> 04:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
housing association um mostly i think
 
04:40:46.390 --> 04:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
i'm here just to answer questions that
 
04:40:49.110 --> 04:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
you may have
 
04:40:51.630 --> 04:40:51.640 align:start position:0%
by chance no okay
 
04:40:51.640 --> 04:40:53.750 align:start position:0%
by chance no okay
[Laughter]

04:40:53.750 --> 04:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:40:55.270 --> 04:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
the intent really is to create more
 
04:40:57.430 --> 04:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
transparency remove
 
04:41:00.150 --> 04:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
barriers from voting and certainly
 
04:41:02.470 --> 04:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
increase voter participation
 
04:41:04.550 --> 04:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
i guess i can sort of follow up on what
 
04:41:06.628 --> 04:41:06.638 align:start position:0%
senator susie mentioned earlier with
 
04:41:10.830 --> 04:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:13.910 --> 04:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
participating have some
 
04:41:15.510 --> 04:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
minutes that i'd like to hand out to you
 
04:41:44.230 --> 04:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:46.628 --> 04:41:46.638 align:start position:0%
so while that's being distributed
 
04:41:49.190 --> 04:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
the documents are meeting minutes for
 
04:41:51.270 --> 04:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
bearview crossing cooperative that's a
 
04:41:52.948 --> 04:41:52.958 align:start position:0%
cooperative located in allenstown new
 
04:41:52.958 --> 04:41:54.390 align:start position:0%
cooperative located in allenstown new
hampshire

04:41:54.390 --> 04:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:41:57.030 --> 04:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
that is a community that consists of
 
04:41:58.868 --> 04:41:58.878 align:start position:0%
i believe 300
 
04:42:03.590 --> 04:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:05.430 --> 04:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
according to these meeting minutes from
 
04:42:07.990 --> 04:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
march 6 of 2019
 
04:42:12.628 --> 04:42:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:14.150 --> 04:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
there's a question how many people do
 
04:42:18.948 --> 04:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:20.788 --> 04:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
according to the pre-acquisition bylaws
 
04:42:22.390 --> 04:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
the quorum needed is one-third of the
 
04:42:24.470 --> 04:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
total membership
 
04:42:26.708 --> 04:42:26.718 align:start position:0%
okay and it resulted in the fact that if
 
04:42:28.628 --> 04:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
only 27 members
 
04:42:28.638 --> 04:42:29.670 align:start position:0%
only 27 members
um

04:42:29.670 --> 04:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:31.430 --> 04:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
were present for the majority to vote
 
04:42:34.550 --> 04:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
yes excuse me the majority would be 14.
 
04:42:36.788 --> 04:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
so 14 people
 
04:42:39.510 --> 04:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
could commit a 300 housing unit
 
04:42:39.520 --> 04:42:40.788 align:start position:0%
could commit a 300 housing unit
community

04:42:40.788 --> 04:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:42:43.030 --> 04:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
to move forward with a 20 million dollar
 
04:42:43.040 --> 04:42:44.868 align:start position:0%
to move forward with a 20 million dollar
purchase

04:42:44.868 --> 04:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
04:42:46.310 --> 04:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to bring that to your
 
04:42:48.550 --> 04:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
attention so that is why we are moving
 
04:42:50.470 --> 04:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
forward with this bill this is why the
 
04:42:52.788 --> 04:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
association has worked collaboratively
 
04:42:55.110 --> 04:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
with the residents um that i believe are
 
04:42:59.670 --> 04:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:02.628 --> 04:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:04.628 --> 04:43:04.638 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
04:43:07.350 --> 04:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you for uh your
 
04:43:09.990 --> 04:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
testimony for this information um just
 
04:43:12.230 --> 04:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
this would be an easy one i i think
 
04:43:13.510 --> 04:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned there are approximately
 
04:43:15.990 --> 04:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
300 housing units correct in this uh
 
04:43:18.470 --> 04:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
bear view crossing cooperative and there
 
04:43:24.550 --> 04:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:26.150 --> 04:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
could you explain the difference between
 
04:43:28.470 --> 04:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
the number of housing units being 300
 
04:43:30.310 --> 04:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
and a membership of 80.
 
04:43:33.350 --> 04:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
if there are only 80 uh members uh what
 
04:43:34.590 --> 04:43:34.600 align:start position:0%
about the other
 
04:43:38.470 --> 04:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
220 housing units are they not members
 
04:43:40.948 --> 04:43:40.958 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding you are not
 
04:43:43.110 --> 04:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
required to be a member
 
04:43:45.670 --> 04:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
of the park
 
04:43:47.590 --> 04:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
but in order to vote you are required to
 
04:43:51.190 --> 04:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
be a member if that makes sense
 
04:43:53.030 --> 04:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
further question may inquire do you have
 
04:43:55.110 --> 04:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
any uh do you have any idea what the
 
04:43:56.788 --> 04:43:56.798 align:start position:0%
membership requirements are for this
 
04:43:56.798 --> 04:43:58.070 align:start position:0%
membership requirements are for this
particular

04:43:58.070 --> 04:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:44:00.628 --> 04:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
crossing cooperative it's my
 
04:44:01.830 --> 04:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
understanding that membership
 
04:44:04.470 --> 04:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
requirements vary for each cooperative
 
04:44:04.480 --> 04:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
requirements vary for each cooperative
um

04:44:04.980 --> 04:44:04.990 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:04.990 --> 04:44:06.070 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

04:44:06.070 --> 04:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:44:08.788 --> 04:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
i know that this one i believe the
 
04:44:08.798 --> 04:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
i know that this one i believe the
um

04:44:09.120 --> 04:44:09.130 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:09.130 --> 04:44:10.230 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

04:44:10.230 --> 04:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:44:13.670 --> 04:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
i believe it was 300 to join
 
04:44:15.350 --> 04:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
but i believe the residents excuse me
 
04:44:16.230 --> 04:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
the residents will have that more
 
04:44:18.788 --> 04:44:18.798 align:start position:0%
information on that
 
04:44:19.990 --> 04:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
04:44:21.670 --> 04:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
so to be a member
 
04:44:23.510 --> 04:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
of the association
 
04:44:26.070 --> 04:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
in the bearview crossing cooperative
 
04:44:27.990 --> 04:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
one would have to pay three 300
 
04:44:29.750 --> 04:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding
 
04:44:30.708 --> 04:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:44:32.390 --> 04:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
that is what the bill is addressing is
 
04:44:34.788 --> 04:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
that outrageous dollar amount yeah just
 
04:44:37.350 --> 04:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
to be clear okay
 
04:44:37.360 --> 04:44:38.470 align:start position:0%
to be clear okay
okay

04:44:38.470 --> 04:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:44:40.390 --> 04:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
representative mclaren uh thank you very
 
04:44:42.550 --> 04:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
much uh just a quick question i i guess
 
04:44:42.560 --> 04:44:43.350 align:start position:0%
much uh just a quick question i i guess
i

04:44:43.350 --> 04:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:44:46.070 --> 04:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
don't quite understand that if a
 
04:44:49.830 --> 04:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
minority of the people vote to to buy
 
04:44:49.840 --> 04:44:51.030 align:start position:0%
minority of the people vote to to buy
the

04:44:51.030 --> 04:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:44:52.390 --> 04:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
the park
 
04:44:55.110 --> 04:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
that does that obligate everybody else
 
04:44:57.430 --> 04:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
to do the same thing
 
04:44:59.590 --> 04:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
yes so once
 
04:44:59.600 --> 04:45:00.628 align:start position:0%
yes so once
the

04:45:00.628 --> 04:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:45:02.230 --> 04:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
minority of people
 
04:45:04.788 --> 04:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
vote to purchase the park
 
04:45:07.350 --> 04:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
all the remaining households
 
04:45:09.190 --> 04:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
are committed to paying off that
 
04:45:10.948 --> 04:45:10.958 align:start position:0%
mortgage just
 
04:45:13.030 --> 04:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
a quick phone question
 
04:45:15.190 --> 04:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
so the only way they could opt out is to
 
04:45:17.110 --> 04:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
get out of the park sell their property
 
04:45:17.120 --> 04:45:18.470 align:start position:0%
get out of the park sell their property
etc

04:45:18.470 --> 04:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
etc
 
04:45:24.470 --> 04:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:24.480 --> 04:45:27.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:45:27.910 --> 04:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:29.510 --> 04:45:29.520 align:start position:0%

04:45:51.190 --> 04:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is louise rydo
 
04:45:53.510 --> 04:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing us today
 
04:45:55.510 --> 04:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'm really excited that this bill is
 
04:45:55.520 --> 04:45:56.628 align:start position:0%
i'm really excited that this bill is
here

04:45:56.628 --> 04:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:45:56.638 --> 04:45:57.510 align:start position:0%
here
we

04:45:57.510 --> 04:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:45:59.270 --> 04:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
are really happy with all the work that
 
04:46:01.670 --> 04:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
senator bradley and senator susie
 
04:46:03.110 --> 04:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
did for us
 
04:46:03.120 --> 04:46:04.708 align:start position:0%
did for us
because

04:46:04.708 --> 04:46:04.718 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:46:06.868 --> 04:46:06.878 align:start position:0%
i live in bedview crossing
 
04:46:10.150 --> 04:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
and we have approximately 300 household
 
04:46:10.160 --> 04:46:11.030 align:start position:0%
and we have approximately 300 household
there

04:46:11.030 --> 04:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:46:14.708 --> 04:46:14.718 align:start position:0%
it was purchased in july of 2019
 
04:46:15.990 --> 04:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
and it became
 
04:46:18.948 --> 04:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
that's when it became the community
 
04:46:18.958 --> 04:46:20.628 align:start position:0%
that's when it became the community
unfortunately

04:46:20.628 --> 04:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
04:46:24.070 --> 04:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
not enough people were really informed
 
04:46:26.550 --> 04:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
i think that any purchase it was 18
 
04:46:28.550 --> 04:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars that was the purchase
 
04:46:31.510 --> 04:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
price our loans are close to 21 million
 
04:46:31.520 --> 04:46:32.628 align:start position:0%
price our loans are close to 21 million
dollars

04:46:32.628 --> 04:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:46:37.750 --> 04:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:39.510 --> 04:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
neglecting to tell us
 
04:46:42.070 --> 04:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
the true loan amount
 
04:46:44.230 --> 04:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
was detrimental because some people
 
04:46:46.708 --> 04:46:46.718 align:start position:0%
would have said yes not knowing
 
04:46:48.550 --> 04:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
the other fees that were involved in
 
04:46:49.750 --> 04:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
getting that
 
04:46:49.760 --> 04:46:52.310 align:start position:0%
getting that
funding

04:46:52.310 --> 04:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:54.550 --> 04:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
and i had to pay ten dollars to be able
 
04:46:57.030 --> 04:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
to vote to be a member to vote
 
04:46:58.550 --> 04:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
the membership fee there is three
 
04:47:00.310 --> 04:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
04:47:02.230 --> 04:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
and we're allowed to in the beginning we
 
04:47:04.310 --> 04:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
were allowed to like pay ten dollars and
 
04:47:05.990 --> 04:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
five dollars a month or you could pay it
 
04:47:07.830 --> 04:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
all up front now they require people who
 
04:47:09.350 --> 04:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
are moving into the park to pay it all
 
04:47:11.190 --> 04:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
up front
 
04:47:13.670 --> 04:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
and we should all all residents should
 
04:47:15.750 --> 04:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
have access to the mortgage terms and
 
04:47:19.030 --> 04:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
land rent per homeowner before voting to
 
04:47:20.550 --> 04:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
purchase a park
 
04:47:23.350 --> 04:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
it's just a good consumer in
 
04:47:25.750 --> 04:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
homeowner i mean where we want to make
 
04:47:27.510 --> 04:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
the best
 
04:47:31.350 --> 04:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
buy you know you don't it sounds so
 
04:47:33.510 --> 04:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
threatening when your park is being sold
 
04:47:36.868 --> 04:47:36.878 align:start position:0%
i moved there in october of 2018 and i
 
04:47:38.470 --> 04:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
found out less than a month later that
 
04:47:40.708 --> 04:47:40.718 align:start position:0%
it was going to be sold and i really had
 
04:47:42.708 --> 04:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
no idea about co-ops or anything so it
 
04:47:44.708 --> 04:47:44.718 align:start position:0%
was all new to me but i attended many
 
04:47:47.430 --> 04:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
many meetings and i asked many many
 
04:47:49.270 --> 04:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
questions which i had been
 
04:47:51.750 --> 04:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
said that i do ask a lot of questions
 
04:47:53.910 --> 04:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
and i was hoping that more people were
 
04:47:55.350 --> 04:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
would participate
 
04:47:57.590 --> 04:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
and it kind of made me not understand
 
04:47:59.670 --> 04:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
why people wouldn't want to
 
04:48:01.190 --> 04:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
but a lot of the people
 
04:48:04.070 --> 04:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
were not informed properly and this is
 
04:48:06.550 --> 04:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
great that
 
04:48:08.708 --> 04:48:08.718 align:start position:0%
there is a there is a way to get to the
 
04:48:08.718 --> 04:48:09.830 align:start position:0%
there is a there is a way to get to the
people

04:48:09.830 --> 04:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:48:12.868 --> 04:48:12.878 align:start position:0%
have them informed give them notices
 
04:48:14.230 --> 04:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
they they need to know what they're
 
04:48:15.990 --> 04:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
getting into and
 
04:48:17.990 --> 04:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
if and then at that point if they choose
 
04:48:20.310 --> 04:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
not to vote that's on them
 
04:48:23.430 --> 04:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
but i love the fact that
 
04:48:25.190 --> 04:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
i've voted my whole life and i love the
 
04:48:28.070 --> 04:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
fact that the participation will
 
04:48:28.080 --> 04:48:29.510 align:start position:0%
fact that the participation will
strengthen

04:48:29.510 --> 04:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
strengthen
 
04:48:31.590 --> 04:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
the co-ops it will really strengthen
 
04:48:31.600 --> 04:48:32.948 align:start position:0%
the co-ops it will really strengthen
everybody's

04:48:32.948 --> 04:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
everybody's
 
04:48:34.868 --> 04:48:34.878 align:start position:0%
because some people are afraid people
 
04:48:37.670 --> 04:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
like i'm 67 people that are older than
 
04:48:37.680 --> 04:48:38.390 align:start position:0%
like i'm 67 people that are older than
me

04:48:38.390 --> 04:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:48:39.750 --> 04:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
they're afraid to go out of the houses
 
04:48:39.760 --> 04:48:40.708 align:start position:0%
they're afraid to go out of the houses
sometimes

04:48:40.708 --> 04:48:40.718 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
04:48:42.550 --> 04:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
but if you have an absentee and we were
 
04:48:44.868 --> 04:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
not allowed to do absentee
 
04:48:47.270 --> 04:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
any of our votes anything in the co-op
 
04:48:49.670 --> 04:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
so this is exciting for people who are
 
04:48:51.910 --> 04:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
able to do an absentee ballot
 
04:48:54.150 --> 04:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
you know i think it's an exciting bill
 
04:48:56.948 --> 04:48:56.958 align:start position:0%
and i know senator soucy and senator
 
04:48:58.868 --> 04:48:58.878 align:start position:0%
bradley worked so hard
 
04:49:00.708 --> 04:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
and i know they worked hard with the
 
04:49:02.150 --> 04:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
community loan fund
 
04:49:04.150 --> 04:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
and i think that what they're presenting
 
04:49:05.910 --> 04:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
to you is amazing
 
04:49:07.910 --> 04:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
i think it's a move
 
04:49:09.830 --> 04:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
a forward direction for affordable
 
04:49:11.910 --> 04:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
housing and let's get people more
 
04:49:14.628 --> 04:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
involved and be better and
 
04:49:15.910 --> 04:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's not
 
04:49:17.110 --> 04:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
you know just
 
04:49:19.110 --> 04:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
it's great it's a great bill and i
 
04:49:21.510 --> 04:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the time well you
 
04:49:23.670 --> 04:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
might want to add that down
 
04:49:25.670 --> 04:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
and only like only two of the
 
04:49:27.670 --> 04:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
22 of the paid membership and you did
 
04:49:29.910 --> 04:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
ask about how many members we have now
 
04:49:31.990 --> 04:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
well because our fee for non-membership
 
04:49:34.070 --> 04:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
is 200 a month
 
04:49:35.910 --> 04:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
people were really yeah on top of the
 
04:49:39.430 --> 04:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
564 that we pay before water and sewer
 
04:49:41.110 --> 04:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
that's a lot that's not even a quarter
 
04:49:43.270 --> 04:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
that gets the point of not affordable
 
04:49:45.510 --> 04:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
so yes so now a lot of there are a lot
 
04:49:47.750 --> 04:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
of members i'm not sure the exact amount
 
04:49:49.670 --> 04:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
of members but most of the people had to
 
04:49:49.680 --> 04:49:50.390 align:start position:0%
of members but most of the people had to
join

04:49:50.390 --> 04:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
join
 
04:49:54.070 --> 04:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
or pay that because remember
 
04:49:56.150 --> 04:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
community loan fund services low to
 
04:49:57.910 --> 04:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
moderate income
 
04:49:59.830 --> 04:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
so if you take
 
04:50:02.868 --> 04:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
this and say oh they let us pay an extra
 
04:50:05.190 --> 04:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
200 you're not really serving the people
 
04:50:06.868 --> 04:50:06.878 align:start position:0%
that you're trying to serve
 
04:50:08.390 --> 04:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
so we have to i think you have to look
 
04:50:10.150 --> 04:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
at the whole
 
04:50:12.310 --> 04:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
whole package
 
04:50:14.230 --> 04:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
and now now it doesn't become what
 
04:50:16.628 --> 04:50:16.638 align:start position:0%
you're trying to work with
 
04:50:18.550 --> 04:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people are excited to get
 
04:50:20.470 --> 04:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
it and be in it
 
04:50:22.550 --> 04:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
there are there are issues here and
 
04:50:24.070 --> 04:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
there i'm not going to say there aren't
 
04:50:25.270 --> 04:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
but there are
 
04:50:28.150 --> 04:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
but i i really support this bill
 
04:50:30.470 --> 04:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
and we hope that you support this bill
 
04:50:32.150 --> 04:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
we believe that this is a step in the
 
04:50:34.070 --> 04:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
right direction in order to shed more
 
04:50:35.750 --> 04:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
light on the operations in the new
 
04:50:38.230 --> 04:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire community loan fund
 
04:50:40.628 --> 04:50:40.638 align:start position:0%
and i'm just going to let i'm going to
 
04:50:45.990 --> 04:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:47.430 --> 04:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
it will make sure the residents are
 
04:50:49.510 --> 04:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
better informed and more involved in the
 
04:50:52.708 --> 04:50:52.718 align:start position:0%
purchase of a multi-million dollar park
 
04:50:52.718 --> 04:50:54.070 align:start position:0%
purchase of a multi-million dollar park
and

04:50:54.070 --> 04:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:50:55.830 --> 04:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
all residents should have access to the
 
04:50:57.190 --> 04:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
mortgage terms
 
04:50:58.788 --> 04:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:51:00.550 --> 04:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
four loans
 
04:51:03.510 --> 04:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
only at one point were we told that one
 
04:51:06.230 --> 04:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
of our loans was a balloon loan
 
04:51:08.788 --> 04:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
i just found out that all of our loans
 
04:51:10.390 --> 04:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
are balloon loans
 
04:51:13.430 --> 04:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
and they're all due in 2029 so we have
 
04:51:15.350 --> 04:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
it's an uphill battle for us
 
04:51:17.030 --> 04:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
and this doesn't this bill might not
 
04:51:19.670 --> 04:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
affect our co-op directly it does in a
 
04:51:19.680 --> 04:51:20.628 align:start position:0%
affect our co-op directly it does in a
way

04:51:20.628 --> 04:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:51:20.638 --> 04:51:21.350 align:start position:0%
way
but

04:51:21.350 --> 04:51:21.360 align:start position:0%

well
 
04:51:38.160 --> 04:51:41.670 align:start position:0%
well
um

04:51:41.670 --> 04:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:44.230 --> 04:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
this bill as louise said it helps
 
04:51:46.628 --> 04:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
everybody in the park now people that
 
04:51:48.550 --> 04:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
are coming into a co-op
 
04:51:50.230 --> 04:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
and it gives better insight on what
 
04:51:51.990 --> 04:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
you're what you're putting your money
 
04:51:52.000 --> 04:51:52.868 align:start position:0%
you're what you're putting your money
into

04:51:52.868 --> 04:51:52.878 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:51:52.878 --> 04:51:54.310 align:start position:0%
into
um

04:51:54.310 --> 04:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:56.470 --> 04:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
these people were told
 
04:51:58.628 --> 04:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
a lot of how do i want to put this this
 
04:52:00.230 --> 04:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
200 fee
 
04:52:02.150 --> 04:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
most of the people in this park were
 
04:52:02.160 --> 04:52:04.070 align:start position:0%
most of the people in this park were
forced

04:52:04.070 --> 04:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
forced
 
04:52:06.550 --> 04:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
to join this co-op and to to jump on the
 
04:52:08.470 --> 04:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
bandwagon because the majority of the
 
04:52:10.470 --> 04:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
people in our park are elderly like
 
04:52:13.350 --> 04:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
myself i'm 69 you're 60 something you're
 
04:52:15.030 --> 04:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
in your 70s
 
04:52:18.230 --> 04:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
we all live on fixed incomes 564 a month
 
04:52:20.550 --> 04:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
with 200 and now you're spending 40 or
 
04:52:22.470 --> 04:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
50 on top of that
 
04:52:24.948 --> 04:52:24.958 align:start position:0%
for your water and sewer
 
04:52:27.830 --> 04:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
so now you're over 800 a month
 
04:52:30.788 --> 04:52:30.798 align:start position:0%
my social security check is 1200 a month
 
04:52:33.430 --> 04:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
that doesn't and i have a mortgage
 
04:52:36.230 --> 04:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
so this gives better insight again
 
04:52:39.270 --> 04:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
so the people that
 
04:52:41.670 --> 04:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
people that want to participate and have
 
04:52:43.430 --> 04:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
this co-op they know what they're
 
04:52:45.350 --> 04:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
getting into
 
04:52:46.868 --> 04:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
they'll look at the bill and they'll say
 
04:52:48.788 --> 04:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
well not three years later oh my god we
 
04:52:51.590 --> 04:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
have three balloon loans
 
04:52:53.750 --> 04:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
nothing was was brought forward that was
 
04:52:57.430 --> 04:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
truthful to the people in this co-op
 
04:52:59.510 --> 04:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
it was everything was unslid under the
 
04:52:59.520 --> 04:53:00.550 align:start position:0%
it was everything was unslid under the
rug

04:53:00.550 --> 04:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
rug
 
04:53:02.390 --> 04:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
our park is in default it's been a
 
04:53:05.510 --> 04:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
non-monetary default for six months
 
04:53:09.430 --> 04:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
but again getting back to this this bill
 
04:53:10.948 --> 04:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
it would do a world of good for
 
04:53:13.190 --> 04:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
everybody in our co-ops now people that
 
04:53:15.270 --> 04:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
want to go and do a co-op
 
04:53:17.190 --> 04:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
they have more insight they'll know what
 
04:53:18.708 --> 04:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
they're getting into
 
04:53:20.948 --> 04:53:20.958 align:start position:0%
and we would appreciate anything you do
 
04:53:23.190 --> 04:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
again i have to thank senator susie
 
04:53:25.110 --> 04:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
senator bradley for spending the time
 
04:53:27.110 --> 04:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
with the three of us listening to
 
04:53:29.430 --> 04:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
listening to what we had to give them
 
04:53:31.910 --> 04:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
the insight we gave them and for the all
 
04:53:33.510 --> 04:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
the hard work they did to put this bill
 
04:53:33.520 --> 04:53:34.948 align:start position:0%
the hard work they did to put this bill
forward

04:53:34.948 --> 04:53:34.958 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:53:38.470 --> 04:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:40.150 --> 04:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
we do have a question representative
 
04:53:40.160 --> 04:53:41.670 align:start position:0%
we do have a question representative
terry

04:53:41.670 --> 04:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
terry
 
04:53:44.230 --> 04:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm in complete agreement uh
 
04:53:45.990 --> 04:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
with where you want to go with this um
 
04:53:49.030 --> 04:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
with the bill um but for some strange
 
04:53:50.230 --> 04:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
reason i just want to have a better
 
04:53:52.390 --> 04:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
understanding of how bad things are
 
04:53:52.400 --> 04:53:53.510 align:start position:0%
understanding of how bad things are
so

04:53:53.510 --> 04:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:53:53.520 --> 04:53:55.670 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:53:55.670 --> 04:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:58.708 --> 04:53:58.718 align:start position:0%
did you have to pay in order to become a
 
04:53:58.718 --> 04:54:00.948 align:start position:0%
did you have to pay in order to become a
resident

04:54:00.948 --> 04:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
resident
 
04:54:02.390 --> 04:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
at this location
 
04:54:05.030 --> 04:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
have a unit in the bare view crossing
 
04:54:05.040 --> 04:54:06.310 align:start position:0%
have a unit in the bare view crossing
cooperative

04:54:06.310 --> 04:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
cooperative
 
04:54:08.470 --> 04:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
if you buy a house now you have to pay
 
04:54:11.190 --> 04:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
300 to join the co-op okay and then you
 
04:54:12.788 --> 04:54:12.798 align:start position:0%
have to pay 200
 
04:54:15.830 --> 04:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
more every month after you pay the
 
04:54:18.070 --> 04:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
okay if you don't pay the 300 and you
 
04:54:19.190 --> 04:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
don't want to be
 
04:54:21.910 --> 04:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
to to be able to vote we had to pay
 
04:54:23.190 --> 04:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
so there were a lot of people that
 
04:54:25.750 --> 04:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
didn't pay and weren't didn't vote
 
04:54:27.910 --> 04:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
so that's why the low turnout and that's
 
04:54:30.230 --> 04:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
why the numbers are so low but at this
 
04:54:31.510 --> 04:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
point if
 
04:54:32.788 --> 04:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
you don't
 
04:54:35.270 --> 04:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
you you choose not to be a member
 
04:54:37.590 --> 04:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
then you do pay the 200.
 
04:54:39.270 --> 04:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
why don't you start by first telling us
 
04:54:41.830 --> 04:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
how much was the rent before any of this
 
04:54:41.840 --> 04:54:42.830 align:start position:0%
how much was the rent before any of this
thing

04:54:42.830 --> 04:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:54:46.150 --> 04:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
occurred when i moved in the rent
 
04:54:49.270 --> 04:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
i heinz corporation owned it
 
04:54:51.590 --> 04:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
the rent was 541 a month
 
04:54:54.390 --> 04:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
541 a month and then what happened was
 
04:54:57.510 --> 04:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
before because we had a investor rhp
 
04:54:59.110 --> 04:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
that wanted to buy
 
04:55:01.030 --> 04:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
so we were told that
 
04:55:04.868 --> 04:55:04.878 align:start position:0%
heinz raised the rents of 559
 
04:55:08.470 --> 04:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
and then after we voted for the co-op
 
04:55:11.510 --> 04:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
i do not know why our
 
04:55:13.910 --> 04:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
we raised the rent another five dollars
 
04:55:16.788 --> 04:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
so in the course of between january 2019
 
04:55:19.190 --> 04:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
and july of 2019
 
04:55:21.110 --> 04:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
our rent went up with 20 something
 
04:55:21.120 --> 04:55:23.590 align:start position:0%
our rent went up with 20 something
dollars

04:55:23.590 --> 04:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:26.550 --> 04:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
now you have to pay
 
04:55:29.190 --> 04:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
for the mortgage
 
04:55:30.868 --> 04:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
that would have been
 
04:55:32.310 --> 04:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
to who knows what the rent would have
 
04:55:36.070 --> 04:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
been once this new heinz corporation
 
04:55:39.270 --> 04:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
well heinz owned it so heinz you know it
 
04:55:41.190 --> 04:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
would it's not hard to sell it they
 
04:55:43.350 --> 04:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to sell so a lot of people were
 
04:55:45.750 --> 04:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
afraid of an investor like our hp coming
 
04:55:49.350 --> 04:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
in and charging an extra 200 a month
 
04:55:51.910 --> 04:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
for our lot fee for who knows it's an
 
04:55:53.670 --> 04:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
unknown you don't know it was an unknown
 
04:55:55.030 --> 04:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
it's an unknown one
 
04:55:57.430 --> 04:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
but so at this point the
 
04:55:59.510 --> 04:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
members of the community you know a
 
04:55:59.520 --> 04:56:00.628 align:start position:0%
members of the community you know a
handful

04:56:00.628 --> 04:56:00.638 align:start position:0%
handful
 
04:56:03.350 --> 04:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
got together and said let's go to
 
04:56:04.948 --> 04:56:04.958 align:start position:0%
the you know to
 
04:56:06.628 --> 04:56:06.638 align:start position:0%
the community loan fund and put this
 
04:56:09.110 --> 04:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
package together and the problem is that
 
04:56:10.708 --> 04:56:10.718 align:start position:0%
there was a limited amount of people who
 
04:56:13.670 --> 04:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
were showing up that initial vote
 
04:56:15.750 --> 04:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
to make that decision
 
04:56:19.190 --> 04:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
so follow please further questions so
 
04:56:21.910 --> 04:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
um in addition to the fact that you
 
04:56:23.750 --> 04:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there was not very good
 
04:56:23.760 --> 04:56:25.110 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there was not very good
information

04:56:25.110 --> 04:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:56:27.750 --> 04:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
prior to the meeting i wonder would you
 
04:56:30.948 --> 04:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
believe okay that's would you believe
 
04:56:32.230 --> 04:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
of course not
 
04:56:32.240 --> 04:56:34.550 align:start position:0%
of course not
um

04:56:34.550 --> 04:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:36.150 --> 04:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
did you mention something about a ten
 
04:56:36.160 --> 04:56:37.190 align:start position:0%
did you mention something about a ten
dollar

04:56:37.190 --> 04:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
04:56:37.200 --> 04:56:38.150 align:start position:0%
dollar
fee

04:56:38.150 --> 04:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
fee
 
04:56:40.310 --> 04:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
to vote so in addition to all the other
 
04:56:42.310 --> 04:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
fees and rents and everything else that
 
04:56:43.350 --> 04:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
you're paying
 
04:56:45.110 --> 04:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh even if you were up to date with all
 
04:56:47.430 --> 04:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
of these payments and fees
 
04:56:49.190 --> 04:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
you had to pay ten dollars just for the
 
04:56:50.788 --> 04:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
privilege to vote
 
04:56:52.628 --> 04:56:52.638 align:start position:0%
this is not free for thank you very much
 
04:56:54.550 --> 04:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
mr chair this sounds like a poll tax to
 
04:56:54.560 --> 04:56:55.670 align:start position:0%
mr chair this sounds like a poll tax to
me

04:56:55.670 --> 04:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:56:57.030 --> 04:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
this i thought that was illegal or is
 
04:56:58.550 --> 04:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
that only in the south
 
04:57:00.868 --> 04:57:00.878 align:start position:0%
this is outrageous thank you okay would
 
04:57:03.750 --> 04:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
you believe yes i represented
 
04:57:05.030 --> 04:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you ladies
 
04:57:06.948 --> 04:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
for for testifying i'm still trying to
 
04:57:10.230 --> 04:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
wrap my head around all of this as well
 
04:57:13.990 --> 04:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
who is responsible for paying this 18 21
 
04:57:16.470 --> 04:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
million dollar mortgage that you own
 
04:57:18.628 --> 04:57:18.638 align:start position:0%
and how where's that money coming from
 
04:57:20.708 --> 04:57:20.718 align:start position:0%
to make that payment because you now
 
04:57:24.788 --> 04:57:24.798 align:start position:0%
you've said that the park is actually
 
04:57:27.590 --> 04:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's in a non-monetary default
 
04:57:28.868 --> 04:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
04:57:28.878 --> 04:57:31.110 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
so

04:57:31.110 --> 04:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:57:32.948 --> 04:57:32.958 align:start position:0%
who who's responsible for paying that
 
04:57:34.550 --> 04:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
where's that money coming from because
 
04:57:36.788 --> 04:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
it takes 300 to
 
04:57:36.798 --> 04:57:37.830 align:start position:0%
it takes 300 to
join

04:57:37.830 --> 04:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
join
 
04:57:37.840 --> 04:57:38.708 align:start position:0%
join
plus

04:57:38.708 --> 04:57:38.718 align:start position:0%
plus
 
04:57:40.788 --> 04:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
200 a month
 
04:57:42.868 --> 04:57:42.878 align:start position:0%
to be a member
 
04:57:42.878 --> 04:57:43.670 align:start position:0%
to be a member
no

04:57:43.670 --> 04:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:57:47.190 --> 04:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
it's a 300 membership fee to join to
 
04:57:49.110 --> 04:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
join but some people don't even have to
 
04:57:52.708 --> 04:57:52.718 align:start position:0%
right no if you do not join
 
04:57:55.350 --> 04:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
your option is to pay 200 extra dollars
 
04:57:58.390 --> 04:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
a month as a non-member got it okay
 
04:57:58.400 --> 04:57:59.190 align:start position:0%
a month as a non-member got it okay
and

04:57:59.190 --> 04:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:58:01.030 --> 04:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
the money comes from
 
04:58:02.550 --> 04:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
all of us and
 
04:58:05.030 --> 04:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
then it's extra to vote
 
04:58:07.350 --> 04:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
it was extra to vote but our payments
 
04:58:09.910 --> 04:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
for these loans which are
 
04:58:11.270 --> 04:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
one loan is
 
04:58:12.868 --> 04:58:12.878 align:start position:0%
almost five percent the other one's a
 
04:58:15.910 --> 04:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
little bit less those loans every loan
 
04:58:17.590 --> 04:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
payment and we're only paying interest
 
04:58:19.750 --> 04:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
as you know with balloon loans
 
04:58:22.550 --> 04:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
that comes from a lot rent of 564 a
 
04:58:22.560 --> 04:58:23.510 align:start position:0%
that comes from a lot rent of 564 a
month

04:58:23.510 --> 04:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
month
 
04:58:25.830 --> 04:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
so it's coming from us we don't well
 
04:58:28.230 --> 04:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
right yeah as it should but right right
 
04:58:29.990 --> 04:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
right this is our responsibility so it's
 
04:58:31.590 --> 04:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
either it's either
 
04:58:32.788 --> 04:58:32.798 align:start position:0%
three hundred dollars to join the
 
04:58:35.430 --> 04:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
association your lot rents 584
 
04:58:37.190 --> 04:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
or you don't join the association and
 
04:58:41.030 --> 04:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
your lot rent is 784 764 764 excuse me
 
04:58:43.350 --> 04:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
764. and they need to pay for the
 
04:58:45.110 --> 04:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
privilege of voting
 
04:58:45.120 --> 04:58:46.230 align:start position:0%
privilege of voting
okay

04:58:46.230 --> 04:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:58:47.830 --> 04:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
i think i understand
 
04:58:49.510 --> 04:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
and i am exhausted
 
04:58:53.430 --> 04:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
okay you're excited we are too
 
04:58:53.440 --> 04:58:54.948 align:start position:0%
okay you're excited we are too
i

04:58:54.948 --> 04:58:54.958 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:58:56.708 --> 04:58:56.718 align:start position:0%
represent fargo
 
04:58:58.310 --> 04:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and and
 
04:59:00.070 --> 04:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry if you had to go through this
 
04:59:02.390 --> 04:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
is some kind of appalling to me and
 
04:59:03.510 --> 04:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
but i'm
 
04:59:06.150 --> 04:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
i'm i must not be understanding properly
 
04:59:07.830 --> 04:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
what happens to those people who were
 
04:59:10.470 --> 04:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
living there who didn't want to didn't
 
04:59:12.788 --> 04:59:12.798 align:start position:0%
want to be a part of it like
 
04:59:15.750 --> 04:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
maybe they didn't vote or they voted no
 
04:59:19.030 --> 04:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
um what happened to them i mean dude
 
04:59:21.350 --> 04:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
are they still held
 
04:59:23.830 --> 04:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
you sure yeah um what happened to the
 
04:59:25.590 --> 04:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
people that didn't vote and didn't want
 
04:59:27.270 --> 04:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
the co-op what they ended up doing was
 
04:59:29.430 --> 04:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
they were they paid their money to to
 
04:59:29.440 --> 04:59:30.470 align:start position:0%
they were they paid their money to to
vote

04:59:30.470 --> 04:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:59:31.830 --> 04:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
and then they when they were told that
 
04:59:34.708 --> 04:59:34.718 align:start position:0%
they had to pay 200 extra a month on top
 
04:59:36.868 --> 04:59:36.878 align:start position:0%
of their lot fee if they didn't join the
 
04:59:40.150 --> 04:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
co-op then they opted to to to pick to
 
04:59:42.310 --> 04:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
join the co-op
 
04:59:44.230 --> 04:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
and pay five or ten dollars a month
 
04:59:46.550 --> 04:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
every month with their lot rent so that
 
04:59:48.788 --> 04:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
when they get to the 300
 
04:59:50.868 --> 04:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
then their membership was
 
04:59:52.550 --> 04:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
in the park was okay
 
04:59:55.750 --> 04:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
so it was almost like they forced
 
04:59:55.760 --> 04:59:56.550 align:start position:0%
so it was almost like they forced
the

04:59:56.550 --> 04:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:59:58.070 --> 04:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
most the majority of these people
 
04:59:59.830 --> 04:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
because they said well
 
05:00:02.150 --> 05:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
if you don't join the co-op then you
 
05:00:05.590 --> 05:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
have to pay 200 extra a month on rent
 
05:00:07.510 --> 05:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
like i said to you before most of us are
 
05:00:09.670 --> 05:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
senior citizens we live on social
 
05:00:13.510 --> 05:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
security 764 50 a month for
 
05:00:15.350 --> 05:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
water and sewer
 
05:00:18.470 --> 05:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
and and if i can add to that when
 
05:00:20.628 --> 05:00:20.638 align:start position:0%
we had this meeting and one of the board
 
05:00:20.638 --> 05:00:21.670 align:start position:0%
we had this meeting and one of the board
members

05:00:21.670 --> 05:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
members
 
05:00:23.910 --> 05:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
motioned this was in all of these rules
 
05:00:25.830 --> 05:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
and i had read everything and he said i
 
05:00:27.750 --> 05:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
motioned to raise first it was supposed
 
05:00:29.830 --> 05:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
to be fifty dollars i motioned to raise
 
05:00:32.150 --> 05:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
it to two hundred i stood up and i said
 
05:00:34.310 --> 05:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
carl that's outrageous you can't do that
 
05:00:36.310 --> 05:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
to people
 
05:00:38.390 --> 05:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
somebody on the board seconded and that
 
05:00:41.110 --> 05:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
was it so this bill is this bill is
 
05:00:41.120 --> 05:00:42.390 align:start position:0%
was it so this bill is this bill is
amazing

05:00:42.390 --> 05:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
amazing
 
05:00:44.550 --> 05:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
if you
 
05:00:47.590 --> 05:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
can i think i'm still confused okay what
 
05:00:49.350 --> 05:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
is yes
 
05:00:50.230 --> 05:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
do you
 
05:00:53.670 --> 05:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
do you own anything i mean do you own
 
05:00:55.110 --> 05:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
your lot
 
05:00:57.590 --> 05:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
no do you own anything we own at the
 
05:00:59.190 --> 05:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
homes that we live in but if you look at
 
05:01:01.510 --> 05:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
brock's website right
 
05:01:03.510 --> 05:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
they say we're home we are we are
 
05:01:03.520 --> 05:01:05.270 align:start position:0%
they say we're home we are we are
landowners

05:01:05.270 --> 05:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
landowners
 
05:01:07.430 --> 05:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
so wow what is some i mean so let's
 
05:01:09.350 --> 05:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
let's get a step back and i was going to
 
05:01:11.190 --> 05:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
let tara introduce this but let's be
 
05:01:12.868 --> 05:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
sure everybody understands a little bit
 
05:01:14.708 --> 05:01:14.718 align:start position:0%
going back
 
05:01:16.788 --> 05:01:16.798 align:start position:0%
at one point in time we have
 
05:01:18.868 --> 05:01:18.878 align:start position:0%
uh i think it was jensen company was a
 
05:01:21.350 --> 05:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
big was a big uh owner of manufactured
 
05:01:22.788 --> 05:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
housing parks
 
05:01:25.510 --> 05:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
and the issue was that they could sell
 
05:01:27.830 --> 05:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
that park out you know the end to
 
05:01:29.830 --> 05:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
anybody they want
 
05:01:31.190 --> 05:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
the issue that i thought was a little
 
05:01:34.150 --> 05:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
disconcerting was the vast majority of
 
05:01:36.310 --> 05:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
these homeowners
 
05:01:38.868 --> 05:01:38.878 align:start position:0%
do not have a lease
 
05:01:41.510 --> 05:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
so they actually have no control over
 
05:01:44.390 --> 05:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
rent increases so a park could be sold
 
05:01:47.110 --> 05:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
to somebody else who could triple triple
 
05:01:48.708 --> 05:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
the rent okay
 
05:01:51.750 --> 05:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
so uh in the wisdom of the legislature
 
05:01:54.948 --> 05:01:54.958 align:start position:0%
we decided to uh create the community
 
05:01:58.708 --> 05:01:58.718 align:start position:0%
loan fund association to allow the parks
 
05:02:00.550 --> 05:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
to be purchased
 
05:02:00.560 --> 05:02:02.948 align:start position:0%
to be purchased
by

05:02:02.948 --> 05:02:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:04.708 --> 05:02:04.718 align:start position:0%
the homeowners
 
05:02:07.030 --> 05:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
now i can say in my one town we have one
 
05:02:08.628 --> 05:02:08.638 align:start position:0%
park it was already bought before i
 
05:02:11.030 --> 05:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
moved to ranch so so i i didn't have you
 
05:02:12.708 --> 05:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
know this is so to me that seemed
 
05:02:15.430 --> 05:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
perfect sense the problem is the devil's
 
05:02:17.590 --> 05:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
in the details of when the legislation
 
05:02:19.190 --> 05:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
was created
 
05:02:20.788 --> 05:02:20.798 align:start position:0%
that it said is well if you're going to
 
05:02:23.350 --> 05:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
have this initial vote who's going to
 
05:02:25.110 --> 05:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
make the vote and
 
05:02:27.030 --> 05:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
i i wasn't around for when that law was
 
05:02:28.470 --> 05:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
created at least i don't think so but
 
05:02:30.788 --> 05:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
maybe it was i don't know it was it was
 
05:02:31.750 --> 05:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
05:02:33.750 --> 05:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
and but that in there they had this
 
05:02:36.628 --> 05:02:36.638 align:start position:0%
concept of members creating them members
 
05:02:39.270 --> 05:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
and you you pay a nominal fee wasn't
 
05:02:41.430 --> 05:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
really stated what the fee was and it
 
05:02:43.270 --> 05:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
was a little loosey-goosey but that was
 
05:02:46.470 --> 05:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
the beginning effort to how do we make
 
05:02:47.910 --> 05:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
this process
 
05:02:51.990 --> 05:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
work to allow the park to be sold to one
 
05:02:54.230 --> 05:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
of these loan funds and so what happened
 
05:02:54.240 --> 05:02:55.510 align:start position:0%
of these loan funds and so what happened
was

05:02:55.510 --> 05:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:02:58.150 --> 05:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
as you could all see that that you know
 
05:03:00.150 --> 05:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
the devil's in the details and then the
 
05:03:02.708 --> 05:03:02.718 align:start position:0%
thing blew up because they got out of
 
05:03:04.948 --> 05:03:04.958 align:start position:0%
control with the fees they got out of
 
05:03:06.550 --> 05:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
control of the relationships of people
 
05:03:08.788 --> 05:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
who showed up and this whole idea of the
 
05:03:11.830 --> 05:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
members um and obviously that's the
 
05:03:13.590 --> 05:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
reason why this legislation is here
 
05:03:16.150 --> 05:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
because we just need to uh clarify and
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
make it a little fair a little more
 
05:03:20.868 --> 05:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
common sense and more rational than what
 
05:03:22.550 --> 05:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
was originally and not only that it
 
05:03:24.310 --> 05:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
helps the people that live in the co-ops
 
05:03:25.830 --> 05:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
too and it gives them a better insight
 
05:03:27.670 --> 05:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
of what they're getting into don't you
 
05:03:30.708 --> 05:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
think and my last statement here if you
 
05:03:33.030 --> 05:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
if you read i i'm here on behalf of many
 
05:03:35.110 --> 05:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
residents who are too afraid to appear
 
05:03:37.430 --> 05:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
here today they are already facing
 
05:03:39.190 --> 05:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
retaliation from our neighbors and they
 
05:03:40.708 --> 05:03:40.718 align:start position:0%
are fearful that there will be more to
 
05:03:42.868 --> 05:03:42.878 align:start position:0%
come because of our efforts today i
 
05:03:44.550 --> 05:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
didn't really want to say that i thought
 
05:03:46.550 --> 05:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
that you could read it but that's our
 
05:03:48.788 --> 05:03:48.798 align:start position:0%
reality in that
 
05:03:48.798 --> 05:03:50.310 align:start position:0%
reality in that
and

05:03:50.310 --> 05:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:03:52.470 --> 05:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
just to mirror that louise and i have
 
05:03:55.670 --> 05:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
been under constant constant retaliation
 
05:03:57.910 --> 05:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
since the three of us have brought this
 
05:03:59.990 --> 05:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
bill forward and
 
05:04:02.628 --> 05:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
testified um it's and it's only for the
 
05:04:05.030 --> 05:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
benefits yeah it's only for the benefits
 
05:04:07.030 --> 05:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
yeah it's an exciting film but you're
 
05:04:08.550 --> 05:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
benefiting and they're benefiting the
 
05:04:10.550 --> 05:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
other people who are also going forward
 
05:04:12.070 --> 05:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
right and so
 
05:04:13.990 --> 05:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
there's a little egg on the face of the
 
05:04:15.910 --> 05:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
of your right but
 
05:04:17.510 --> 05:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
that again they should be happy because
 
05:04:20.230 --> 05:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
that would get more people involved in
 
05:04:22.628 --> 05:04:22.638 align:start position:0%
co-ops when they can see what they have
 
05:04:24.628 --> 05:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
so to retaliate
 
05:04:26.390 --> 05:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
against three people who have been
 
05:04:28.788 --> 05:04:28.798 align:start position:0%
trying to help the co-ops and the people
 
05:04:31.270 --> 05:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
upcoming the people now
 
05:04:33.350 --> 05:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
it's just not it's not fair it's very
 
05:04:35.430 --> 05:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunate you know it's just it's not
 
05:04:35.440 --> 05:04:36.310 align:start position:0%
unfortunate you know it's just it's not
right

05:04:36.310 --> 05:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:04:38.868 --> 05:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
but again thank you thank you and thank

05:06:09.350 --> 05:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
this point in the testimony because he
 
05:06:11.110 --> 05:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
knew i would have just a little as
 
05:06:13.510 --> 05:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
senator susie said cleaning up to do
 
05:06:13.520 --> 05:06:15.110 align:start position:0%
senator susie said cleaning up to do
fact-wise

05:06:15.110 --> 05:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
fact-wise
 
05:06:17.750 --> 05:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
so let me do my planned testimony first
 
05:06:19.270 --> 05:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
and then go back to some of the
 
05:06:20.708 --> 05:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
questions that were just asked and
 
05:06:20.718 --> 05:06:22.788 align:start position:0%
questions that were just asked and
answered

05:06:22.788 --> 05:06:22.798 align:start position:0%
answered
 
05:06:24.230 --> 05:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
i work for the new hampshire community
 
05:06:26.390 --> 05:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
loan fund which is a community
 
05:06:29.110 --> 05:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
development finance authority it is a
 
05:06:32.150 --> 05:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
federally created financial institution
 
05:06:33.670 --> 05:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
there's about a thousand of them
 
05:06:35.590 --> 05:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
nationwide but the community loan fund
 
05:06:38.390 --> 05:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
is one of the oldest and the best known
 
05:06:40.230 --> 05:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
we're a new hampshire non-profit
 
05:06:42.390 --> 05:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
organization not associated with the
 
05:06:45.030 --> 05:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
state and our service footprint is new
 
05:06:45.040 --> 05:06:46.230 align:start position:0%
state and our service footprint is new
hampshire

05:06:46.230 --> 05:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:06:48.868 --> 05:06:48.878 align:start position:0%
our mission is to assist people who
 
05:06:51.430 --> 05:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
don't have access to capital nobody will
 
05:06:52.788 --> 05:06:52.798 align:start position:0%
lend them money is that what that
 
05:06:55.510 --> 05:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
translates to to more fully participate
 
05:06:57.910 --> 05:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire's economy we do that by
 
05:07:00.070 --> 05:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
taking in local investments from new
 
05:07:02.390 --> 05:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire people we pay them a return on
 
05:07:04.628 --> 05:07:04.638 align:start position:0%
an investment and we lend it out to
 
05:07:06.150 --> 05:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
other people who otherwise wouldn't be
 
05:07:06.160 --> 05:07:07.510 align:start position:0%
other people who otherwise wouldn't be
participating

05:07:07.510 --> 05:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
participating
 
05:07:09.750 --> 05:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
so 37 years ago the new hampshire
 
05:07:11.430 --> 05:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
community loan fund started with a
 
05:07:13.910 --> 05:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
meredith manufactured housing park that
 
05:07:16.708 --> 05:07:16.718 align:start position:0%
was going to close because the mom and
 
05:07:19.430 --> 05:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
pop owners were entering a nursing home
 
05:07:21.590 --> 05:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
and the the people were going to lose
 
05:07:23.750 --> 05:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
their their land to redevelopment there
 
05:07:25.830 --> 05:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
were 17 homes they went to every bank
 
05:07:28.708 --> 05:07:28.718 align:start position:0%
they couldn't get a loan from any place
 
05:07:30.868 --> 05:07:30.878 align:start position:0%
but they did meet a student who
 
05:07:32.948 --> 05:07:32.958 align:start position:0%
connected them to the community loan
 
05:07:35.350 --> 05:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
fund and the sisters of mercy made the
 
05:07:37.510 --> 05:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
community loan fund its very first
 
05:07:39.910 --> 05:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
investment so the community loan fund in
 
05:07:41.910 --> 05:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
fact could help out meredith village
 
05:07:41.920 --> 05:07:43.190 align:start position:0%
fact could help out meredith village
cooperative

05:07:43.190 --> 05:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
cooperative
 
05:07:44.868 --> 05:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
a successful co-op
 
05:07:46.788 --> 05:07:46.798 align:start position:0%
cooperative to this day those same homes
 
05:07:49.270 --> 05:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
still sitting in the same place and the
 
05:07:51.430 --> 05:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
and the son of one of them who we stay
 
05:07:53.030 --> 05:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
in touch with tells us what a difference
 
05:07:54.550 --> 05:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
it made in his life
 
05:07:54.560 --> 05:07:55.670 align:start position:0%
it made in his life
um

05:07:55.670 --> 05:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:58.310 --> 05:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
so manufactured homes are a great home
 
05:08:00.868 --> 05:08:00.878 align:start position:0%
ownership opportunity for even low and
 
05:08:02.550 --> 05:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
moderate income people they're
 
05:08:02.560 --> 05:08:03.750 align:start position:0%
moderate income people they're
affordable

05:08:03.750 --> 05:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
05:08:05.910 --> 05:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's the good news and 75 percent of
 
05:08:08.070 --> 05:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
the people populations that we work with
 
05:08:10.788 --> 05:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
fit the low and moderate income criteria
 
05:08:13.190 --> 05:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
the bad news is when you own your home
 
05:08:15.590 --> 05:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
and it's on rented land there's some
 
05:08:18.390 --> 05:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
instability there you always face the
 
05:08:20.310 --> 05:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
possibility that the land can be bought
 
05:08:22.070 --> 05:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
by somebody else it may be another
 
05:08:23.430 --> 05:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
investor who's going to run it as a
 
05:08:26.390 --> 05:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
manufacturing housing park it may be
 
05:08:27.910 --> 05:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
somebody who's going to clear that land
 
05:08:29.590 --> 05:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
because it's a nice flat site that they
 
05:08:31.270 --> 05:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
can develop
 
05:08:34.310 --> 05:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
and in fact sometimes there's closure
 
05:08:37.190 --> 05:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
and the land isn't even developed
 
05:08:40.868 --> 05:08:40.878 align:start position:0%
or it can be a lot increased so high
 
05:08:42.470 --> 05:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
that you can't afford to live there
 
05:08:44.230 --> 05:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
anymore and you don't move these homes
 
05:08:45.910 --> 05:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
you walk away from these homes if you
 
05:08:47.430 --> 05:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
can't sell them
 
05:08:49.430 --> 05:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
so representative de palmer i wish he
 
05:08:51.110 --> 05:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
was here has the most famous of those
 
05:08:52.628 --> 05:08:52.638 align:start position:0%
examples in the state of new hampshire
 
05:08:54.470 --> 05:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
where it happened in littleton in a
 
05:08:56.390 --> 05:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
community called willowdale which had a
 
05:08:59.990 --> 05:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
really sad uh out turn so a smart common
 
05:09:02.070 --> 05:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
sense solution for that is for the
 
05:09:04.230 --> 05:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
residents to come together form a
 
05:09:07.030 --> 05:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
cooperative and buy the land themselves
 
05:09:08.708 --> 05:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
and that's what the community loan fund
 
05:09:12.150 --> 05:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
does and we've done it 142 times in the
 
05:09:14.070 --> 05:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire it is an
 
05:09:16.868 --> 05:09:16.878 align:start position:0%
incredible and and all are still
 
05:09:16.878 --> 05:09:18.230 align:start position:0%
incredible and and all are still
successful

05:09:18.230 --> 05:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
successful
 
05:09:20.390 --> 05:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
we've not only lent them the money to do
 
05:09:24.070 --> 05:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
that but we provided on average 20 000
 
05:09:26.550 --> 05:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
hours of technical assistance a year to
 
05:09:29.670 --> 05:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
help people run their community
 
05:09:32.470 --> 05:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
as introduced sb 210 would have almost
 
05:09:34.470 --> 05:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
eliminated this program we would have
 
05:09:36.788 --> 05:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
closed one of those
 
05:09:39.430 --> 05:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
communities in the last two years that i
 
05:09:42.150 --> 05:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
went back and looked at that part and
 
05:09:44.150 --> 05:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
all of the uh talk that you're hearing
 
05:09:46.150 --> 05:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
about voting and voting thresholds and
 
05:09:47.510 --> 05:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
how many people were at the meeting was
 
05:09:49.910 --> 05:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
eliminated in this bill when in fact
 
05:09:52.150 --> 05:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
senator susie and senator bradley red
 
05:09:54.230 --> 05:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
drafted the amendment not an issue
 
05:09:56.310 --> 05:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
anymore but i'll clear up a little bit
 
05:09:57.910 --> 05:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
of that in a minute
 
05:10:00.550 --> 05:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
so the most successful new hampshire
 
05:10:03.750 --> 05:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
created homegrown local solution to an
 
05:10:05.830 --> 05:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
affordable housing crisis sounds like
 
05:10:07.350 --> 05:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
something that we probably ought to be
 
05:10:07.360 --> 05:10:08.470 align:start position:0%
something that we probably ought to be
preserving

05:10:08.470 --> 05:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
preserving
 
05:10:09.910 --> 05:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
not only has new hampshire done this
 
05:10:12.708 --> 05:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
with 142 co-ops but the movement has
 
05:10:14.310 --> 05:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
taken off across the united states
 
05:10:16.310 --> 05:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
there's a hundred and fifty more of
 
05:10:19.830 --> 05:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
these communities in uh 20 other states
 
05:10:21.350 --> 05:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
so we worked with senator bradley and
 
05:10:23.510 --> 05:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
senator susie and came up with this
 
05:10:25.590 --> 05:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
amendment uh and it brought up some
 
05:10:27.750 --> 05:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
really good discussion and some really
 
05:10:30.230 --> 05:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
good agreements uh resulted from that
 
05:10:32.070 --> 05:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
the most onerous as i said the voting
 
05:10:35.190 --> 05:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
threshold was taken out that we're
 
05:10:37.350 --> 05:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
thankful for that absentee ballots are a
 
05:10:39.190 --> 05:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
great idea we know that not everybody
 
05:10:40.868 --> 05:10:40.878 align:start position:0%
can get out of their house they have
 
05:10:42.708 --> 05:10:42.718 align:start position:0%
challenges sometimes to getting out to
 
05:10:44.230 --> 05:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
voting and cooperative
 
05:10:47.910 --> 05:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
a low dollar joining fee is a great idea
 
05:10:50.788 --> 05:10:50.798 align:start position:0%
and the small differential for rent for
 
05:10:54.230 --> 05:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
members non-members 200 dollars we find
 
05:10:56.470 --> 05:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
that offensive that is nothing we have
 
05:10:58.390 --> 05:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
anything to do with in fact the
 
05:11:00.550 --> 05:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
residents vote for that so
 
05:11:02.230 --> 05:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
you would hope that neighbors would help
 
05:11:04.390 --> 05:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
out neighbors and be thoughtful of that
 
05:11:07.110 --> 05:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
and that didn't happen we have no other
 
05:11:09.190 --> 05:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
community that has a two hundred dollar
 
05:11:11.190 --> 05:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
rent differential in the state of new
 
05:11:13.190 --> 05:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire i am proud to say
 
05:11:15.830 --> 05:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
but it has also brought up conversations
 
05:11:17.510 --> 05:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
at the new hampshire community loan fund
 
05:11:18.948 --> 05:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
us as a lender
 
05:11:20.948 --> 05:11:20.958 align:start position:0%
going forward will flag those kinds of
 
05:11:23.030 --> 05:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
things we have the choice to fund those
 
05:11:25.430 --> 05:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
groups and decide whether or not that's
 
05:11:27.830 --> 05:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
a group that we want to fund and in fact
 
05:11:30.150 --> 05:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
the answer may be no in some of those
 
05:11:31.910 --> 05:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
situations where
 
05:11:33.510 --> 05:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
neighbors don't have their neighbor's
 
05:11:35.990 --> 05:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
best interests in mind
 
05:11:39.110 --> 05:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
um so sp 210 adds it to law and it adds
 
05:11:41.110 --> 05:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
it to 205a
 
05:11:43.110 --> 05:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
i think it's probably suited better in
 
05:11:45.350 --> 05:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
301a which is actually the consumer
 
05:11:47.670 --> 05:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
cooperative statute we needed to get to
 
05:11:48.868 --> 05:11:48.878 align:start position:0%
an agreement
 
05:11:50.070 --> 05:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
we did
 
05:11:52.230 --> 05:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
i mentioned we are thinking about that
 
05:11:54.150 --> 05:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
in our lending criteria having a lot of
 
05:11:56.470 --> 05:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
conversation about that and the other
 
05:11:58.708 --> 05:11:58.718 align:start position:0%
part of the bill that changed was you
 
05:12:01.110 --> 05:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
notice that the park owners association
 
05:12:03.430 --> 05:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
gets a notice of
 
05:12:05.510 --> 05:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
the residents buying these communities
 
05:12:07.670 --> 05:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
or that there's a community available to
 
05:12:10.070 --> 05:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
purchase we ask that the terms of that
 
05:12:12.310 --> 05:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
deal be excluded from the statute you
 
05:12:14.550 --> 05:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
can find out that the park is being sold
 
05:12:16.550 --> 05:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
but we don't want other park owners
 
05:12:18.310 --> 05:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
finding out what the terms of the deal
 
05:12:19.750 --> 05:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
is that's
 
05:12:22.070 --> 05:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
that is just not something that we're in
 
05:12:24.550 --> 05:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
favor of um in our book a little a
 
05:12:27.430 --> 05:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
little a little invasive for our
 
05:12:29.430 --> 05:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
especially an unrelated party that they
 
05:12:31.670 --> 05:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
have nothing to do with um there was a
 
05:12:34.948 --> 05:12:34.958 align:start position:0%
companion bill 324 that you'll hear next
 
05:12:37.510 --> 05:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
week it set up a dispute resolution
 
05:12:37.520 --> 05:12:38.628 align:start position:0%
week it set up a dispute resolution
which

05:12:38.628 --> 05:12:38.638 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:12:40.150 --> 05:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
in the event there was a dispute
 
05:12:41.590 --> 05:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
resolution in each one of these
 
05:12:43.430 --> 05:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
communities they could probably take
 
05:12:45.110 --> 05:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
care of that themselves i don't know
 
05:12:47.590 --> 05:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen to sb 324 but
 
05:12:49.030 --> 05:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
we're committed at the community loan
 
05:12:51.270 --> 05:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
fund to look at the template bylaws we
 
05:12:53.990 --> 05:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
provide and make sure that that can be
 
05:12:55.590 --> 05:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
happening on the ground level in each
 
05:12:56.868 --> 05:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
one of these
 
05:12:56.878 --> 05:12:58.390 align:start position:0%
one of these
communities

05:12:58.390 --> 05:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
communities
 
05:13:00.788 --> 05:13:00.798 align:start position:0%
i also want to offer i would be glad all
 
05:13:03.190 --> 05:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
of you probably have a resident owned
 
05:13:05.270 --> 05:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
community with 142 of them in your
 
05:13:07.750 --> 05:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
community someplace i would love to have
 
05:13:09.350 --> 05:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
a conversation to tell you what's in
 
05:13:11.110 --> 05:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
your district we do business and child
 
05:13:13.510 --> 05:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
care lending to the community loan fund
 
05:13:15.510 --> 05:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
is a really great resource for the state
 
05:13:17.190 --> 05:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire we want to make sure
 
05:13:18.948 --> 05:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
people not only know about it but can
 
05:13:20.868 --> 05:13:20.878 align:start position:0%
take advantage
 
05:13:22.788 --> 05:13:22.798 align:start position:0%
i want to just go back to a couple of
 
05:13:25.510 --> 05:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
the things that were said in response to
 
05:13:27.670 --> 05:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
questions and maybe not not asked of the
 
05:13:30.310 --> 05:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
person that could best respond to those
 
05:13:30.320 --> 05:13:31.350 align:start position:0%
person that could best respond to those
um

05:13:31.350 --> 05:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:33.190 --> 05:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
so the voting threshold isn't in the
 
05:13:36.230 --> 05:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
bill anymore um bearview cooperative i
 
05:13:37.910 --> 05:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
went back and looked after our senate
 
05:13:40.230 --> 05:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
hearing there were actually 100 members
 
05:13:42.310 --> 05:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
when they made their final vote when
 
05:13:43.830 --> 05:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
they knew what their mortgage was going
 
05:13:45.990 --> 05:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
to be what their lot rent would increase
 
05:13:47.670 --> 05:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
to and all of that
 
05:13:49.430 --> 05:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
as you know because you're all elected
 
05:13:51.670 --> 05:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
officials i'm an elected official if you
 
05:13:54.628 --> 05:13:54.638 align:start position:0%
can get you know 50 percent of people to
 
05:13:57.190 --> 05:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
show up for me that's pretty amazing
 
05:13:59.430 --> 05:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
nowadays but we do go through that pro
 
05:14:02.708 --> 05:14:02.718 align:start position:0%
former line by line and i will say
 
05:14:05.030 --> 05:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
bearview had very very high rent and
 
05:14:06.948 --> 05:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
they had a fannie mae mortgage that has
 
05:14:08.310 --> 05:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
to be defeased which i won't tell you
 
05:14:09.990 --> 05:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
about it's just it adds a million
 
05:14:10.000 --> 05:14:10.868 align:start position:0%
about it's just it adds a million
dollars

05:14:10.868 --> 05:14:10.878 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:14:13.030 --> 05:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
to the sales price that
 
05:14:15.270 --> 05:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
complicated that they do have four
 
05:14:17.510 --> 05:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
mortgages on the property bankprov an
 
05:14:19.590 --> 05:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
institutional lender who sees these as
 
05:14:19.600 --> 05:14:20.628 align:start position:0%
institutional lender who sees these as
great

05:14:20.628 --> 05:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
great
 
05:14:20.638 --> 05:14:22.150 align:start position:0%
great
opportunities

05:14:22.150 --> 05:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
05:14:25.030 --> 05:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
where a second mortgage holder on their
 
05:14:26.788 --> 05:14:26.798 align:start position:0%
community were also a third mortgage
 
05:14:28.628 --> 05:14:28.638 align:start position:0%
holder they needed more money than they
 
05:14:30.470 --> 05:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
had to close in those mortgages and we
 
05:14:32.868 --> 05:14:32.878 align:start position:0%
gave them a zero percent loan because we
 
05:14:34.550 --> 05:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
didn't want them to raise their rent
 
05:14:36.868 --> 05:14:36.878 align:start position:0%
more than five dollars at the time we
 
05:14:38.708 --> 05:14:38.718 align:start position:0%
look at these transactions very very
 
05:14:40.868 --> 05:14:40.878 align:start position:0%
carefully and you'll hear from elliot
 
05:14:43.750 --> 05:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
berry we are very very conscious about
 
05:14:46.628 --> 05:14:46.638 align:start position:0%
what the what the acceptable market rate
 
05:14:49.270 --> 05:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
rent is in that area and not to go above
 
05:14:51.430 --> 05:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
that because when we do that it makes it
 
05:14:53.110 --> 05:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
really hard for them to sell a home
 
05:14:54.708 --> 05:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
there's other choices and they won't be
 
05:14:56.390 --> 05:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
able to sell their home
 
05:14:59.110 --> 05:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
if in fact that happens um
 
05:15:01.030 --> 05:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
and the pro forma we do a pro forma
 
05:15:03.830 --> 05:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
obviously as all lenders do for all of
 
05:15:07.270 --> 05:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
those transactions um i i also just want
 
05:15:10.150 --> 05:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
to point out um that um
 
05:15:12.230 --> 05:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
nobody paid two or three hundred dollars
 
05:15:15.030 --> 05:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
to vote when you when you want to buy a
 
05:15:17.110 --> 05:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
piece of property that costs 18 million
 
05:15:19.990 --> 05:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
dollars banks don't just say okay those
 
05:15:21.670 --> 05:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
five guys over there can have the loan
 
05:15:24.310 --> 05:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
you have to form a business entity the
 
05:15:26.628 --> 05:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
business entity that we help people form
 
05:15:28.948 --> 05:15:28.958 align:start position:0%
as a consumer cooperative
 
05:15:31.190 --> 05:15:31.200 align:start position:0%
the the statute requires that there be
 
05:15:33.270 --> 05:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
some kind of joining fee for you to join
 
05:15:35.990 --> 05:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
that cooperative we in most cases make
 
05:15:38.470 --> 05:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
it five bucks that's what people can
 
05:15:41.590 --> 05:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
afford their membership fee may in fact
 
05:15:44.470 --> 05:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
be 300 again the residents decide that
 
05:15:47.750 --> 05:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
themselves we don't we don't do that and
 
05:15:49.670 --> 05:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
they don't pay that 300 unless they buy
 
05:15:51.190 --> 05:15:51.200 align:start position:0%
the community we're not going to have
 
05:15:53.270 --> 05:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
somebody pay 300 bucks up front to join
 
05:15:55.430 --> 05:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
a cooperative if in fact they never buy
 
05:15:57.510 --> 05:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
the community it's unaffordable so when
 
05:15:59.590 --> 05:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
they buy the community they then can pay
 
05:16:01.590 --> 05:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
it at the rate of five dollars a month
 
05:16:03.910 --> 05:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
with their rent and if it takes them you
 
05:16:06.230 --> 05:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
know six years to pay it off then that's
 
05:16:08.310 --> 05:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
what happens new people coming in just
 
05:16:10.708 --> 05:16:10.718 align:start position:0%
like a condo or any other conveyance you
 
05:16:12.150 --> 05:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
pay your membership fee as part of your
 
05:16:13.430 --> 05:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
closing costs
 
05:16:15.990 --> 05:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
when you come in so i hope that clears
 
05:16:17.910 --> 05:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
things up
 
05:16:21.590 --> 05:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
there are some instances when neighbors
 
05:16:24.310 --> 05:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
make bad decisions for their that
 
05:16:26.550 --> 05:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
include their other neighbors we are not
 
05:16:30.070 --> 05:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
in favor of that we uh are instituting
 
05:16:32.708 --> 05:16:32.718 align:start position:0%
practices to keep that from happening um
 
05:16:34.948 --> 05:16:34.958 align:start position:0%
in the future and i would be more than
 
05:16:38.070 --> 05:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions or clarify
 
05:16:39.830 --> 05:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
anything else that you've heard that
 
05:16:41.670 --> 05:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
really feels
 
05:16:41.680 --> 05:16:44.230 align:start position:0%
really feels
ugly

05:16:44.230 --> 05:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:45.990 --> 05:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative greeson
 
05:16:47.350 --> 05:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
thank you ms chairman thank you for your
 
05:16:49.270 --> 05:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
testimony and thank you for clarifying a
 
05:16:50.628 --> 05:16:50.638 align:start position:0%
lot of that
 
05:16:50.638 --> 05:16:52.230 align:start position:0%
lot of that
information

05:16:52.230 --> 05:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:16:55.350 --> 05:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
of the 142 communities in the state
 
05:16:55.360 --> 05:16:56.390 align:start position:0%
of the 142 communities in the state
um

05:16:56.390 --> 05:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:59.670 --> 05:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
how many of these communities have paid
 
05:17:01.590 --> 05:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
off their mortgage and they own it free
 
05:17:03.750 --> 05:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
and clear what was the average amount of
 
05:17:06.310 --> 05:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
time taken to pay off those loans
 
05:17:07.910 --> 05:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
because i this may just be an
 
05:17:07.920 --> 05:17:09.350 align:start position:0%
because i this may just be an
exceptionally

05:17:09.350 --> 05:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
exceptionally
 
05:17:11.190 --> 05:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
bad deal or something because i don't
 
05:17:13.350 --> 05:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
see how bear creek pays off in under a
 
05:17:14.868 --> 05:17:14.878 align:start position:0%
hundred years
 
05:17:17.510 --> 05:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
um i i can't tell you the exact number
 
05:17:20.390 --> 05:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
of um co-ops that um have paid off their
 
05:17:21.910 --> 05:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
mortgage but i can tell you they have a
 
05:17:24.310 --> 05:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
party when it happens and they get very
 
05:17:26.070 --> 05:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
very excited
 
05:17:28.150 --> 05:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
there is a co-op in winchester new
 
05:17:30.550 --> 05:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire who has not raised its rent
 
05:17:32.310 --> 05:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
does not have a mortgage has not raised
 
05:17:35.350 --> 05:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
its lot rent in 20 years it's still 240
 
05:17:37.190 --> 05:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
dollars and that's the beauty of a
 
05:17:40.310 --> 05:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit consumer cooperative so
 
05:17:41.670 --> 05:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
as to the
 
05:17:44.070 --> 05:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
21 million dollars the prices for
 
05:17:46.150 --> 05:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing parks are becoming
 
05:17:48.868 --> 05:17:48.878 align:start position:0%
extreme because they are such a hot
 
05:17:50.868 --> 05:17:50.878 align:start position:0%
investment for private equity money
 
05:17:52.390 --> 05:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
coming from outside the state of new
 
05:17:55.270 --> 05:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire and it's wild we do
 
05:17:58.310 --> 05:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
a 10-year mortgage with a 40-year
 
05:18:00.868 --> 05:18:00.878 align:start position:0%
amortization and refinance that at 10
 
05:18:03.030 --> 05:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
years as do the lenders
 
05:18:05.190 --> 05:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
td bank bank of new hampshire bank prob
 
05:18:06.628 --> 05:18:06.638 align:start position:0%
everybody that's in the first place
 
05:18:08.470 --> 05:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
position because lenders aren't going to
 
05:18:10.230 --> 05:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
commit to that interest rate more than
 
05:18:13.030 --> 05:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
10 years we will refinance it at that
 
05:18:14.628 --> 05:18:14.638 align:start position:0%
time and they'll have another 40-year
 
05:18:17.270 --> 05:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
amortization but our explanation to the
 
05:18:19.110 --> 05:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
residents is you want to pay your home
 
05:18:20.868 --> 05:18:20.878 align:start position:0%
off because you're dying to retire
 
05:18:23.350 --> 05:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
someday on the fixed incomes that that
 
05:18:26.070 --> 05:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
you have the cooperative we don't want a
 
05:18:28.628 --> 05:18:28.638 align:start position:0%
higher rent right now so somebody gets
 
05:18:31.190 --> 05:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
to live cheap in 50 years this is a
 
05:18:33.510 --> 05:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
forever perpetual corporation and it
 
05:18:35.990 --> 05:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
makes sense for us to do it that way
 
05:18:37.590 --> 05:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much and just
 
05:18:39.590 --> 05:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
just for reference i i crunched the
 
05:18:42.470 --> 05:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
numbers on 10 if they if it was 10 years
 
05:18:44.830 --> 05:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
just paid it off in 10 years it's
 
05:18:44.840 --> 05:18:46.470 align:start position:0%
just paid it off in 10 years it's
583.33

05:18:46.470 --> 05:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
583.33
 
05:18:48.390 --> 05:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
dollars per month just to pay off the
 
05:18:48.400 --> 05:18:49.670 align:start position:0%
dollars per month just to pay off the
principal

05:18:49.670 --> 05:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
principal
 
05:18:51.990 --> 05:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
per household in that park so that's
 
05:18:54.628 --> 05:18:54.638 align:start position:0%
just not doable we we have a we have a
 
05:18:57.910 --> 05:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
community uh right now in rochester that
 
05:18:59.830 --> 05:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
we just started working with this week
 
05:19:02.868 --> 05:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
it has 491 homes in the community their
 
05:19:05.190 --> 05:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
rent is over 500
 
05:19:06.708 --> 05:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
and the purchase price for the community
 
05:19:09.350 --> 05:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
is 54 million dollars it's the same
 
05:19:11.430 --> 05:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
owner as they had the same park owner
 
05:19:13.190 --> 05:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
that they have who's a
 
05:19:15.190 --> 05:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
guy out of canada
 
05:19:17.670 --> 05:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
the lot rent alone in that
 
05:19:17.680 --> 05:19:18.868 align:start position:0%
the lot rent alone in that
community

05:19:18.868 --> 05:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
community
 
05:19:23.110 --> 05:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
brings in over 250 000 a month so when
 
05:19:25.350 --> 05:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
we talk about debt service we look at
 
05:19:27.750 --> 05:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
that so at the income that's coming in
 
05:19:29.830 --> 05:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
right now there's three million dollars
 
05:19:31.910 --> 05:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
available to you know mow the lawns pay
 
05:19:33.990 --> 05:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
the property manager and um and pay the
 
05:19:35.430 --> 05:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
debt service so
 
05:19:37.910 --> 05:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
the lot rents completely dictate what
 
05:19:40.470 --> 05:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
what size debt service could be serviced
 
05:19:40.480 --> 05:19:42.470 align:start position:0%
what size debt service could be serviced
yeah

05:19:42.470 --> 05:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:19:44.310 --> 05:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
representative abel
 
05:19:47.030 --> 05:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you for
 
05:19:49.030 --> 05:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
explaining things but i have to be
 
05:19:50.550 --> 05:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
honest and say
 
05:19:53.350 --> 05:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
that i understand this less now than i
 
05:19:56.470 --> 05:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
did when i read this
 
05:19:58.390 --> 05:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
and i i would like to ask sort of a
 
05:20:02.550 --> 05:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:02.560 --> 05:20:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
i

05:20:03.750 --> 05:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:20:05.590 --> 05:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
don't feel
 
05:20:07.670 --> 05:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
ever that i can vote for a bill if i
 
05:20:10.070 --> 05:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
don't understand it i do not understand
 
05:20:11.430 --> 05:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:20:13.830 --> 05:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
and if we were having our executive
 
05:20:15.590 --> 05:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
session now i would certainly vote
 
05:20:17.030 --> 05:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
against the bill
 
05:20:19.670 --> 05:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
i wonder how you would respond to that
 
05:20:19.680 --> 05:20:20.788 align:start position:0%
i wonder how you would respond to that
uh

05:20:20.788 --> 05:20:20.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:20:23.110 --> 05:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
sir i i served on this committee for
 
05:20:26.070 --> 05:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
seven terms we had a lot of bills that
 
05:20:28.230 --> 05:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
covered a lot of
 
05:20:30.390 --> 05:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
subject matter that was very hard to be
 
05:20:33.750 --> 05:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
an expert in each one of those i respect
 
05:20:35.830 --> 05:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
what you have to say
 
05:20:37.910 --> 05:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
and i will say i tried to note in my
 
05:20:40.548 --> 05:20:40.558 align:start position:0%
testimony some of the red flag issues
 
05:20:41.830 --> 05:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
that we've seen
 
05:20:44.948 --> 05:20:44.958 align:start position:0%
we are going to fix uh as a lender and
 
05:20:47.270 --> 05:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
and not be a lender if there's a 200
 
05:20:49.990 --> 05:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
rent differential so although
 
05:20:52.548 --> 05:20:52.558 align:start position:0%
this bill might not survive the point
 
05:20:55.110 --> 05:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
i'm making is a lot of the issues that
 
05:20:58.070 --> 05:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
we have seen in the communities
 
05:21:00.788 --> 05:21:00.798 align:start position:0%
we can probably handle as a lender to
 
05:21:02.470 --> 05:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
that community by prohibiting those
 
05:21:02.480 --> 05:21:05.030 align:start position:0%
that community by prohibiting those
practices

05:21:05.030 --> 05:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
practices
 
05:21:08.070 --> 05:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
and uh i know that i'm as a chairman i'm
 
05:21:10.070 --> 05:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
not supposed to say this but
 
05:21:12.150 --> 05:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh rich i just hope you paid attention
 
05:21:15.030 --> 05:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
to who is in support of the bill
 
05:21:18.948 --> 05:21:18.958 align:start position:0%
and who is showing support
 
05:21:20.708 --> 05:21:20.718 align:start position:0%
i'm in support
 
05:21:23.350 --> 05:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
with a little bit of concerns
 
05:21:25.270 --> 05:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
about some of the disclosure but pay
 
05:21:26.788 --> 05:21:26.798 align:start position:0%
attention to the people who are in
 
05:21:29.350 --> 05:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
support of the bill
 
05:21:30.708 --> 05:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
05:21:32.390 --> 05:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much for your
 
05:21:34.628 --> 05:21:34.638 align:start position:0%

breath
 
05:22:02.638 --> 05:22:03.430 align:start position:0%
breath
we

05:22:03.430 --> 05:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:22:06.070 --> 05:22:06.080 align:start position:0%

assistance where i've been a practicing
 
05:22:31.510 --> 05:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
attorney for over 40 years i'm even
 
05:22:35.430 --> 05:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
i have an interesting
 
05:22:39.590 --> 05:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
viewpoint about all this i should say
 
05:22:41.110 --> 05:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
from the start that i'm one of the
 
05:22:41.120 --> 05:22:42.230 align:start position:0%
from the start that i'm one of the
founders

05:22:42.230 --> 05:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
founders
 
05:22:44.548 --> 05:22:44.558 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire community loan fund
 
05:22:47.030 --> 05:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
i also was one of the drafters and
 
05:22:49.190 --> 05:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
lobbyists behind the the
 
05:22:54.548 --> 05:22:54.558 align:start position:0%
uh rsa 205 section was at 17 through 22
 
05:22:58.150 --> 05:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
which started this co-op movement
 
05:22:58.160 --> 05:22:59.190 align:start position:0%
which started this co-op movement
and

05:22:59.190 --> 05:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:23:01.910 --> 05:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
but interestingly enough
 
05:23:03.670 --> 05:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
right now today
 
05:23:06.470 --> 05:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
most of my involvement comes
 
05:23:06.480 --> 05:23:07.670 align:start position:0%
most of my involvement comes
from

05:23:07.670 --> 05:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:23:10.310 --> 05:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
from defending tenants who are getting
 
05:23:13.430 --> 05:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
evicted from parks including co-op parks
 
05:23:15.350 --> 05:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm not going to sit here and tell
 
05:23:17.430 --> 05:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
you this is like the greatest thing that
 
05:23:19.590 --> 05:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
has ever happened
 
05:23:22.310 --> 05:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
to owners of manufactured housing
 
05:23:22.320 --> 05:23:24.230 align:start position:0%
to owners of manufactured housing
however

05:23:24.230 --> 05:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:23:27.910 --> 05:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
what makes me so happy about this uh
 
05:23:27.920 --> 05:23:29.670 align:start position:0%
what makes me so happy about this uh
amendment

05:23:29.670 --> 05:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:23:32.868 --> 05:23:32.878 align:start position:0%
is that it closes one of the biggest
 
05:23:34.948 --> 05:23:34.958 align:start position:0%
problems that i have seen and that is
 
05:23:37.830 --> 05:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
that giant rent differential be often
 
05:23:40.310 --> 05:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
200 off the charts and this that their
 
05:23:42.230 --> 05:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
park is the only one i've ever seen it
 
05:23:44.548 --> 05:23:44.558 align:start position:0%
but i really thank the folks from bear
 
05:23:47.110 --> 05:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
but i used to be bear brook i forget
 
05:23:48.230 --> 05:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
their view
 
05:23:51.110 --> 05:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
they've done a great service by you know
 
05:23:54.708 --> 05:23:54.718 align:start position:0%
creating momentum to to really make it
 
05:23:54.718 --> 05:23:55.510 align:start position:0%
creating momentum to to really make it
as

05:23:55.510 --> 05:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:23:59.590 --> 05:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
affordable as it possibly can be
 
05:23:59.600 --> 05:24:00.548 align:start position:0%
affordable as it possibly can be
and

05:24:00.548 --> 05:24:00.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:24:02.868 --> 05:24:02.878 align:start position:0%
and it is terrific if i could just give
 
05:24:05.110 --> 05:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
you a little bit of background the
 
05:24:07.670 --> 05:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
reason that the current law is in effect
 
05:24:09.590 --> 05:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
that gives the tenants notice and an
 
05:24:12.310 --> 05:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to purchase it came out of
 
05:24:15.590 --> 05:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
basically a disaster in milford where an
 
05:24:18.230 --> 05:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
owner was selling the park and the new
 
05:24:20.150 --> 05:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
owner was going to close it
 
05:24:23.990 --> 05:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
and there were 55 people there who were
 
05:24:25.670 --> 05:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely it was you know like a
 
05:24:27.430 --> 05:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
tornado would come and wipe out the
 
05:24:28.948 --> 05:24:28.958 align:start position:0%
whole community
 
05:24:32.310 --> 05:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
so that created momentum to create a
 
05:24:35.750 --> 05:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
situation where to the maximum possible
 
05:24:35.760 --> 05:24:36.788 align:start position:0%
situation where to the maximum possible
extent

05:24:36.788 --> 05:24:36.798 align:start position:0%
extent
 
05:24:39.590 --> 05:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
people who own their homes in a
 
05:24:41.830 --> 05:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing park
 
05:24:44.788 --> 05:24:44.798 align:start position:0%
never had to worry about getting having
 
05:24:47.510 --> 05:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
their park closed and getting displaced
 
05:24:50.310 --> 05:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
by that or by having a series of
 
05:24:52.868 --> 05:24:52.878 align:start position:0%
investor owners purchase and sell
 
05:24:55.190 --> 05:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
purchase and sell purchase and sell
 
05:24:57.190 --> 05:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
until yeah and the price just keeps
 
05:24:59.190 --> 05:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
skyrocketing which is in fact still
 
05:25:01.510 --> 05:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
happening in the private market today
 
05:25:04.310 --> 05:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
that's a benefit that no matter what the
 
05:25:06.548 --> 05:25:06.558 align:start position:0%
chinks are what the problems are in
 
05:25:10.070 --> 05:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
certain co-ops that benefit is i think
 
05:25:12.788 --> 05:25:12.798 align:start position:0%
it so outweighs any of those problems
 
05:25:12.798 --> 05:25:14.150 align:start position:0%
it so outweighs any of those problems
that

05:25:14.150 --> 05:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:25:17.510 --> 05:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
in that i think especially with the
 
05:25:19.670 --> 05:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
improvements that have
 
05:25:21.590 --> 05:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
that this bill is making
 
05:25:24.470 --> 05:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
is just going to
 
05:25:26.628 --> 05:25:26.638 align:start position:0%
to provide the maximum amount of
 
05:25:28.788 --> 05:25:28.798 align:start position:0%
protection that manufactured housing
 
05:25:30.788 --> 05:25:30.798 align:start position:0%
park owners will have
 
05:25:31.990 --> 05:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's still going to be plenty of
 
05:25:33.590 --> 05:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
cases though the way the prices are
 
05:25:35.510 --> 05:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
going crazy on manufactured housing
 
05:25:38.070 --> 05:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
parks they're going to be kept places at
 
05:25:40.788 --> 05:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
times when the tenants even with the
 
05:25:43.350 --> 05:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
even with the funding from the community
 
05:25:45.030 --> 05:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
loan fund and bankers who have
 
05:25:47.190 --> 05:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
understood their value but there's going
 
05:25:48.470 --> 05:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
to be times we're just not going to be
 
05:25:51.830 --> 05:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
able to do it but at least the law
 
05:25:53.670 --> 05:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
that we currently have
 
05:25:55.750 --> 05:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
will give gives the the tenants a
 
05:25:57.750 --> 05:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
fighting chance for the homeowners a
 
05:25:59.830 --> 05:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
fighting chance and with the changes
 
05:26:02.708 --> 05:26:02.718 align:start position:0%
we've made uh it'll enable them to keep
 
05:26:05.270 --> 05:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
the rents as low as possible
 
05:26:07.110 --> 05:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
so with that i just
 
05:26:12.150 --> 05:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:14.788 --> 05:26:14.798 align:start position:0%
support the image
 
05:26:16.470 --> 05:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
we've known each other a long time enjoy
 
05:26:18.548 --> 05:26:18.558 align:start position:0%
this and i i can't
 
05:26:20.470 --> 05:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
let you go without saying this this is
 
05:26:22.230 --> 05:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
or would you believe okay so you don't
 
05:26:24.948 --> 05:26:24.958 align:start position:0%
have to respond but i still go back to
 
05:26:27.990 --> 05:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
this problem never would have occurred
 
05:26:30.150 --> 05:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
if the own homeowners
 
05:26:33.750 --> 05:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
had a lease
 
05:26:35.910 --> 05:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not allowed to say okay you're
 
05:26:37.670 --> 05:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
allowed to respond
 
05:26:39.590 --> 05:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
like the state of connecticut has that
 
05:26:39.600 --> 05:26:40.390 align:start position:0%
like the state of connecticut has that
law

05:26:40.390 --> 05:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:26:42.150 --> 05:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
and i always said that would have solved
 
05:26:43.990 --> 05:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of problems if we had passed that
 
05:26:44.000 --> 05:26:45.590 align:start position:0%
a lot of problems if we had passed that
law

05:26:45.590 --> 05:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:26:45.600 --> 05:26:46.470 align:start position:0%
law
thanks

05:26:46.470 --> 05:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
05:26:48.390 --> 05:26:48.400 align:start position:0%

uh we had eight support two opposed
 
05:26:57.840 --> 05:26:59.110 align:start position:0%

05:31:19.430 --> 05:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
i do think
 
05:31:41.750 --> 05:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:59.270 --> 05:31:59.280 align:start position:0%

be something
 
05:32:37.910 --> 05:32:37.920 align:start position:0%

i am here to introduce sb212 relative to
 
05:33:45.830 --> 05:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
liquor manufacturers
 
05:33:48.708 --> 05:33:48.718 align:start position:0%
sb 212 is a request that comes from the
 
05:33:52.070 --> 05:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire craft brewers association
 
05:33:53.670 --> 05:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
and i personally have been working with
 
05:33:56.070 --> 05:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
a member of my district out of flag hill
 
05:33:58.310 --> 05:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
winery in lee
 
05:34:00.310 --> 05:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill is essentially
 
05:34:03.510 --> 05:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
to allow craft brewers of liquor to
 
05:34:06.310 --> 05:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
serve cocktails at their tasting rooms
 
05:34:08.230 --> 05:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
up to two cocktails when food is
 
05:34:08.240 --> 05:34:09.590 align:start position:0%
up to two cocktails when food is
available

05:34:09.590 --> 05:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
available
 
05:34:12.548 --> 05:34:12.558 align:start position:0%
it will allow craft brewers to it will
 
05:34:14.310 --> 05:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
also allow craft brewers to sell their
 
05:34:16.150 --> 05:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
product at farmers markets under
 
05:34:18.310 --> 05:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
different limitations that are now more
 
05:34:21.110 --> 05:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
relevant there was a previous limitation
 
05:34:23.430 --> 05:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
which excluded had the practical effect
 
05:34:25.030 --> 05:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
of excluding almost all liquor
 
05:34:28.230 --> 05:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturers from such markets
 
05:34:30.230 --> 05:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
we all saw how businesses suffered
 
05:34:31.830 --> 05:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
during the closures and limitations of
 
05:34:34.548 --> 05:34:34.558 align:start position:0%
the coven 19 pandemic and this bill
 
05:34:36.548 --> 05:34:36.558 align:start position:0%
which i affectionately call the new
 
05:34:39.670 --> 05:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire craft cocktail support act
 
05:34:42.150 --> 05:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
it's just another tool in the toolbox to
 
05:34:44.708 --> 05:34:44.718 align:start position:0%
aid a small business industry in their
 
05:34:44.718 --> 05:34:47.590 align:start position:0%
aid a small business industry in their
recovery

05:34:47.590 --> 05:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:50.628 --> 05:34:50.638 align:start position:0%
you know the intent here is is to allow
 
05:34:53.510 --> 05:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
for distillers essentially to showcase
 
05:34:56.868 --> 05:34:56.878 align:start position:0%
their product in a different way um i i
 
05:34:56.878 --> 05:34:58.070 align:start position:0%
their product in a different way um i i
wouldn't

05:34:58.070 --> 05:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
05:34:59.590 --> 05:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
presume to
 
05:35:01.110 --> 05:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
comment on anyone's habits here in the
 
05:35:02.390 --> 05:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
room but i know
 
05:35:04.948 --> 05:35:04.958 align:start position:0%
many like to enjoy cocktails as opposed
 
05:35:06.708 --> 05:35:06.718 align:start position:0%
to drinking their liquor
 
05:35:09.510 --> 05:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
straighter plane and so the ability here
 
05:35:11.670 --> 05:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
for our small businesses to make sure
 
05:35:11.680 --> 05:35:12.548 align:start position:0%
for our small businesses to make sure
that

05:35:12.548 --> 05:35:12.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:35:15.110 --> 05:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
their product can kind of be shown in
 
05:35:17.510 --> 05:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
its diversity or in different
 
05:35:19.750 --> 05:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
applications is a way
 
05:35:22.390 --> 05:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
that these small businesses can
 
05:35:25.670 --> 05:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
continue to to grow
 
05:35:27.270 --> 05:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
you know their customer base and their
 
05:35:29.750 --> 05:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
business provide jobs in our state um
 
05:35:31.510 --> 05:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
you know and continue to be a part of
 
05:35:33.110 --> 05:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
our economy
 
05:35:36.708 --> 05:35:36.718 align:start position:0%
in um in center commerce we
 
05:35:39.590 --> 05:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
amended sb 212 to address the concerns
 
05:35:41.830 --> 05:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
of the liquor commission um
 
05:35:43.430 --> 05:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
making sure that
 
05:35:43.440 --> 05:35:44.548 align:start position:0%
making sure that
uh

05:35:44.548 --> 05:35:44.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:35:46.548 --> 05:35:46.558 align:start position:0%
we reduced the amount of liquor that was
 
05:35:49.670 --> 05:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
able to be served by a half ounce
 
05:35:51.670 --> 05:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to accommodate them
 
05:35:53.430 --> 05:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
because it has been a very collaborative
 
05:35:53.440 --> 05:35:55.510 align:start position:0%
because it has been a very collaborative
process

05:35:55.510 --> 05:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:35:57.590 --> 05:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
once amended sb212 passed center
 
05:36:00.548 --> 05:36:00.558 align:start position:0%
commerce unanimously and it passed the
 
05:36:03.430 --> 05:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
full senate on the consent calendar so
 
05:36:05.750 --> 05:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
um i will leave it at that and i am
 
05:36:07.350 --> 05:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that i'm
 
05:36:07.360 --> 05:36:12.230 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that i'm
able

05:36:12.230 --> 05:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:12.240 --> 05:36:13.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:36:13.910 --> 05:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:36:16.150 --> 05:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
 
05:36:18.230 --> 05:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
just out of curiosity didn't part of
 
05:36:18.240 --> 05:36:19.110 align:start position:0%
just out of curiosity didn't part of
this

05:36:19.110 --> 05:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:36:20.868 --> 05:36:20.878 align:start position:0%
didn't we already passed something like
 
05:36:20.878 --> 05:36:21.910 align:start position:0%
didn't we already passed something like
this

05:36:21.910 --> 05:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:36:21.920 --> 05:36:23.590 align:start position:0%
this
already

05:36:23.590 --> 05:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
already
 
05:36:25.350 --> 05:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't this part of it be a
 
05:36:28.390 --> 05:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:30.390 --> 05:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
as far as the uh liquor manufacturing
 
05:36:31.830 --> 05:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
and farmers markets
 
05:36:34.948 --> 05:36:34.958 align:start position:0%
yes so well so that's why i'm asking
 
05:36:36.310 --> 05:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
because i thought we already passed it
 
05:36:38.628 --> 05:36:38.638 align:start position:0%
out of here last session might be more
 
05:36:41.190 --> 05:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
relevant for mr moore
 
05:36:44.150 --> 05:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
exactly um so i'm going to defer
 
05:36:45.910 --> 05:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative to let the gentleman
 
05:36:47.750 --> 05:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
behind me answer that in more detail but
 
05:36:50.230 --> 05:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is that you did
 
05:36:52.788 --> 05:36:52.798 align:start position:0%
pass something similar but that what
 
05:36:55.110 --> 05:36:55.120 align:start position:0%
we're proposing today would um would
 
05:36:57.350 --> 05:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
allow more participation in the farmers
 
05:36:57.360 --> 05:36:59.430 align:start position:0%
allow more participation in the farmers
markets

05:36:59.430 --> 05:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
markets
 
05:37:02.948 --> 05:37:02.958 align:start position:0%
it's an ad it's an adjunct bill
 
05:37:04.868 --> 05:37:04.878 align:start position:0%
well mr mr chair i understand your
 
05:37:05.750 --> 05:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
question because i was actually about to
 
05:37:07.590 --> 05:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
ask the same thing we had another
 
05:37:09.750 --> 05:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
question first okay
 
05:37:11.670 --> 05:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i was just confused
 
05:37:14.070 --> 05:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
about one thing um when you can have it
 
05:37:16.470 --> 05:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
says you can have two cocktails
 
05:37:18.628 --> 05:37:18.638 align:start position:0%
um with two ounces of liquor each are
 
05:37:22.070 --> 05:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
those could those be provided free
 
05:37:23.670 --> 05:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
it wasn't clear to me because it says
 
05:37:25.590 --> 05:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
they could be for you know before you
 
05:37:27.910 --> 05:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
could pay a fee or free is that the same
 
05:37:29.910 --> 05:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
with the two cocktails with the two
 
05:37:31.030 --> 05:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
ounces each
 
05:37:33.510 --> 05:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
um the intent is
 
05:37:37.830 --> 05:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
for them to be available as part of um
 
05:37:40.230 --> 05:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
a paid tasting but i'm also going to
 
05:37:42.070 --> 05:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
defer your question to the gentleman
 
05:37:44.548 --> 05:37:44.558 align:start position:0%
behind me because i think that
 
05:37:46.708 --> 05:37:46.718 align:start position:0%
it's an option to be offered free or not
 
05:37:49.270 --> 05:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
but i don't want to mistake so okay i'm
 
05:37:50.548 --> 05:37:50.558 align:start position:0%
probably in the minority would you
 
05:37:52.788 --> 05:37:52.798 align:start position:0%
believe but i would be smashed if i had
 
05:37:55.110 --> 05:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
two cocktails with two ounces each fair
 
05:37:55.120 --> 05:37:58.628 align:start position:0%
two cocktails with two ounces each fair
enough

05:37:58.628 --> 05:37:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:01.110 --> 05:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your would you believe
 
05:38:01.120 --> 05:38:03.270 align:start position:0%
thank you for your would you believe
it

05:38:03.270 --> 05:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:05.750 --> 05:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative greeson thank you
 
05:38:07.270 --> 05:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and thank you senator for
 
05:38:09.270 --> 05:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
this i think the the
 
05:38:09.280 --> 05:38:10.230 align:start position:0%
this i think the the
my

05:38:10.230 --> 05:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:38:12.310 --> 05:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
recollection of a similar nature and we
 
05:38:13.910 --> 05:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
we can always defer to someone else
 
05:38:16.788 --> 05:38:16.798 align:start position:0%
later but it's around the number 839
 
05:38:19.270 --> 05:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
leader cases of his products there's a
 
05:38:19.280 --> 05:38:20.310 align:start position:0%
leader cases of his products there's a
similar

05:38:20.310 --> 05:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
similar
 
05:38:23.030 --> 05:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh and it wasn't 830 and what i'm
 
05:38:25.110 --> 05:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
concerned about is whatever we passed
 
05:38:27.190 --> 05:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
previously and this may not be the same
 
05:38:29.110 --> 05:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
numbers and now we're going to end up
 
05:38:32.390 --> 05:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
having a collision of of worlds here so
 
05:38:34.628 --> 05:38:34.638 align:start position:0%
i if it's something you can't answer i
 
05:38:36.628 --> 05:38:36.638 align:start position:0%
appreciate that i'm
 
05:38:38.070 --> 05:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
certain we want to i just want to make
 
05:38:40.310 --> 05:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not
 
05:38:42.150 --> 05:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
we're not messing something up here yeah
 
05:38:44.470 --> 05:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i do not have
 
05:38:45.910 --> 05:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
the history you're looking for but i do
 
05:38:49.510 --> 05:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
believe that my constituent does

a peak card
 
05:39:02.830 --> 05:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
for a
 
05:39:06.310 --> 05:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
certain aiden moore
 
05:39:09.110 --> 05:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:12.230 --> 05:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:12.240 --> 05:39:16.948 align:start position:0%
 
hayden

05:39:16.948 --> 05:39:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:18.470 --> 05:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman
 
05:39:21.030 --> 05:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
i have not provided the card uh i was
 
05:39:22.708 --> 05:39:22.718 align:start position:0%
really here to answer any questions that
 
05:39:24.150 --> 05:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
the committee might have
 
05:39:26.470 --> 05:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh for the committee's benefit my name
 
05:39:28.150 --> 05:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
is aiden moore i'm the legal coordinator
 
05:39:29.910 --> 05:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
for the state liquor commission
 
05:39:31.110 --> 05:39:31.120 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:39:32.948 --> 05:39:32.958 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i'd like to i think the bill
 
05:39:34.788 --> 05:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
that you looked at
 
05:39:37.270 --> 05:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
was a bill that originally came to you
 
05:39:38.470 --> 05:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
as a bill
 
05:39:38.480 --> 05:39:39.430 align:start position:0%
as a bill
dealing

05:39:39.430 --> 05:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
dealing
 
05:39:41.110 --> 05:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
with creating a
 
05:39:44.230 --> 05:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
distiller's license for farmers
 
05:39:47.510 --> 05:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
and that bill was amended and changed to
 
05:39:48.868 --> 05:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
now allow
 
05:39:52.548 --> 05:39:52.558 align:start position:0%
for a second tier of distilled beverage
 
05:39:52.558 --> 05:39:53.750 align:start position:0%
for a second tier of distilled beverage
production

05:39:53.750 --> 05:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
production
 
05:39:55.590 --> 05:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
the distiller's license
 
05:39:58.788 --> 05:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
costs 1 692
 
05:40:01.990 --> 05:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
and in an interest of bringing a tiered
 
05:40:04.310 --> 05:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
approach to distilling
 
05:40:06.310 --> 05:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
the committee passed a bill
 
05:40:07.670 --> 05:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
that would allow
 
05:40:10.150 --> 05:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
a business that produces i believe under
 
05:40:10.160 --> 05:40:12.708 align:start position:0%
a business that produces i believe under
under

05:40:12.708 --> 05:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:15.430 --> 05:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's under a thousand cases
 
05:40:18.310 --> 05:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
to now pay a fee of 300
 
05:40:21.430 --> 05:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of an incubator license get
 
05:40:23.190 --> 05:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
them in business and once their
 
05:40:24.868 --> 05:40:24.878 align:start position:0%
production increases and goes beyond
 
05:40:26.830 --> 05:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
that then the fee would be adjusted
 
05:40:26.840 --> 05:40:28.390 align:start position:0%
that then the fee would be adjusted
upward

05:40:28.390 --> 05:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
upward
 
05:40:29.590 --> 05:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
05:40:32.788 --> 05:40:32.798 align:start position:0%
on on this particular bill sir
 
05:40:35.190 --> 05:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
as the senator said uh you'll hear from
 
05:40:37.510 --> 05:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
representatives of the distillers area
 
05:40:40.070 --> 05:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
we were very happy to
 
05:40:41.350 --> 05:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
work with them
 
05:40:43.350 --> 05:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
especially on the areas of product
 
05:40:43.360 --> 05:40:44.470 align:start position:0%
especially on the areas of product
tasting

05:40:44.470 --> 05:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
tasting
 
05:40:45.830 --> 05:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
and to
 
05:40:48.470 --> 05:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
ask them to consider changing
 
05:40:51.350 --> 05:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
the earlier bill to an ounce and a half
 
05:40:54.230 --> 05:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
for which really represents a standard
 
05:40:54.240 --> 05:40:55.030 align:start position:0%
for which really represents a standard
pour

05:40:55.030 --> 05:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
pour
 
05:40:57.430 --> 05:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
if you will for spirits
 
05:41:00.628 --> 05:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
and to have some uniformity in the
 
05:41:02.230 --> 05:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
pouring process
 
05:41:05.190 --> 05:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:05.200 --> 05:41:05.910 align:start position:0%
 
the

05:41:05.910 --> 05:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:41:07.670 --> 05:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
provision that has
 
05:41:11.030 --> 05:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
is being changed here in part two
 
05:41:11.040 --> 05:41:12.390 align:start position:0%
is being changed here in part two
lines

05:41:12.390 --> 05:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
lines
 
05:41:15.350 --> 05:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me lines six and seven
 
05:41:17.670 --> 05:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
this was brought to you
 
05:41:21.510 --> 05:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
last uh maybe two years ago
 
05:41:23.190 --> 05:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
as a method of product allowing
 
05:41:25.030 --> 05:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
distillers to get into the farmers
 
05:41:27.830 --> 05:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
market wine manufacturers can do it
 
05:41:30.310 --> 05:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturers can do it and
 
05:41:32.310 --> 05:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
this was to allow distillers
 
05:41:32.320 --> 05:41:33.430 align:start position:0%
this was to allow distillers
to

05:41:33.430 --> 05:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:41:34.788 --> 05:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
keep it a
 
05:41:36.788 --> 05:41:36.798 align:start position:0%
method of providing for the craft
 
05:41:38.070 --> 05:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
distiller to be able to get into the
 
05:41:38.080 --> 05:41:39.590 align:start position:0%
distiller to be able to get into the
marketplace

05:41:39.590 --> 05:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
marketplace
 
05:41:43.270 --> 05:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
the senate agreed to amend a bill to
 
05:41:45.190 --> 05:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
identify businesses
 
05:41:47.590 --> 05:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
that produced less than ten thousand
 
05:41:51.270 --> 05:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
bottles as a threshold of eligibility
 
05:41:52.310 --> 05:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
and i think you'll hear from the
 
05:41:53.750 --> 05:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
industry behind me
 
05:41:55.350 --> 05:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
where some of their members now have
 
05:41:57.830 --> 05:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
exceeded that or are exceeding it which
 
05:42:00.230 --> 05:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
is now taking them away from the farmers
 
05:42:02.628 --> 05:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
market opportunities and they're looking
 
05:42:04.788 --> 05:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
to provide a new formula
 
05:42:07.270 --> 05:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
that would allow their members to
 
05:42:09.110 --> 05:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
continue to participate in a farmer's
 
05:42:09.120 --> 05:42:10.548 align:start position:0%
continue to participate in a farmer's
market

05:42:10.548 --> 05:42:10.558 align:start position:0%
market
 
05:42:12.548 --> 05:42:12.558 align:start position:0%
so with that i'd be happy to take any
 
05:42:14.230 --> 05:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
questions you might have sir our
 
05:42:17.430 --> 05:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:17.440 --> 05:42:18.830 align:start position:0%
 
seeing

05:42:18.830 --> 05:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
05:42:21.590 --> 05:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh you mr chair thank you for taking my
 
05:42:21.600 --> 05:42:22.470 align:start position:0%
uh you mr chair thank you for taking my
question

05:42:22.470 --> 05:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:42:24.150 --> 05:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:42:24.160 --> 05:42:25.270 align:start position:0%
so um
you're

05:42:25.270 --> 05:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
you're
 
05:42:26.788 --> 05:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill or you're just
 
05:42:28.230 --> 05:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
here to answer questions and we're here
 
05:42:29.750 --> 05:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
to answer questions
 
05:42:31.270 --> 05:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
and so if this
 
05:42:33.910 --> 05:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
bill did pass then you would work with
 
05:42:35.750 --> 05:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
the distilleries too
 
05:42:36.788 --> 05:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
we do
 
05:42:39.430 --> 05:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
their president uh brian ferguson is uh
 
05:42:40.708 --> 05:42:40.718 align:start position:0%
we have a work a great working
 
05:42:42.628 --> 05:42:42.638 align:start position:0%
relationship with that organization and
 
05:42:44.390 --> 05:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
he is a fine representative of that
 
05:42:46.948 --> 05:42:46.958 align:start position:0%
industry great thanks
 
05:42:49.030 --> 05:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:42:51.270 --> 05:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
representative johnson

thank you for taking my question um kind
 
05:42:53.680 --> 05:42:54.470 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um kind
of

05:42:54.470 --> 05:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:42:56.310 --> 05:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
back to what representative greeson was
 
05:42:56.320 --> 05:42:57.430 align:start position:0%
back to what representative greeson was
saying

05:42:57.430 --> 05:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
saying
 
05:42:59.190 --> 05:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
can we make sure that we're not in
 
05:43:01.190 --> 05:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
conflict with some of the
 
05:43:03.430 --> 05:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
other bills that we passed last session
 
05:43:05.910 --> 05:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
especially with this 890 leader case i
 
05:43:07.430 --> 05:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to see us a conflict and then
 
05:43:09.270 --> 05:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
them get in trouble and we're battling
 
05:43:10.868 --> 05:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
back and forth i'd like to make sure
 
05:43:13.190 --> 05:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
we're all on the same page
 
05:43:14.868 --> 05:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
agreed representative
 
05:43:16.868 --> 05:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to certainly do with
 
05:43:16.878 --> 05:43:17.670 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to certainly do with
this

05:43:17.670 --> 05:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:43:20.070 --> 05:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
is that um
 
05:43:21.990 --> 05:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
the figure that they're proposing this
 
05:43:22.000 --> 05:43:22.750 align:start position:0%
the figure that they're proposing this
this

05:43:22.750 --> 05:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:43:26.628 --> 05:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
839 liter cases um would allow them if
 
05:43:29.030 --> 05:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
they're having a 12 bottle case 750
 
05:43:32.150 --> 05:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
milliliters would be roughly 9 960
 
05:43:34.948 --> 05:43:34.958 align:start position:0%
bottles so their members could sell at
 
05:43:37.990 --> 05:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
farmers market up to that quantity
 
05:43:38.000 --> 05:43:39.350 align:start position:0%
farmers market up to that quantity
um

05:43:39.350 --> 05:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:39.360 --> 05:43:40.150 align:start position:0%
um
and

05:43:40.150 --> 05:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:43:41.590 --> 05:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
if they sold less obviously they could
 
05:43:43.510 --> 05:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
do that but they couldn't sell more than
 
05:43:43.520 --> 05:43:44.470 align:start position:0%
do that but they couldn't sell more than
that

05:43:44.470 --> 05:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:43:47.750 --> 05:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
that is this this provision is
 
05:43:50.628 --> 05:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
distinguished from the earlier bill
 
05:43:52.390 --> 05:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
because that
 
05:43:55.670 --> 05:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
is a bill dealing with production only
 
05:43:55.680 --> 05:43:57.270 align:start position:0%
is a bill dealing with production only
so

05:43:57.270 --> 05:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:43:59.030 --> 05:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
if you decided you wanted to open a
 
05:43:59.040 --> 05:44:00.150 align:start position:0%
if you decided you wanted to open a
distillery

05:44:00.150 --> 05:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
distillery
 
05:44:02.548 --> 05:44:02.558 align:start position:0%
and you said you know gee i understand
 
05:44:04.070 --> 05:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
it's six you know sixteen hundred
 
05:44:05.990 --> 05:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
dollars to open one i i don't have that
 
05:44:08.628 --> 05:44:08.638 align:start position:0%
kind of start-up money then the bill you
 
05:44:09.990 --> 05:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
passed said
 
05:44:11.990 --> 05:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
well if you make less than a thousand
 
05:44:12.000 --> 05:44:13.190 align:start position:0%
well if you make less than a thousand
cases

05:44:13.190 --> 05:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
cases
 
05:44:13.200 --> 05:44:13.990 align:start position:0%
cases
then

05:44:13.990 --> 05:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:44:18.628 --> 05:44:18.638 align:start position:0%
your fee will not be 1600 it'll be 300.
 
05:44:21.190 --> 05:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
by getting that license you would still
 
05:44:23.430 --> 05:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
be eligible to participate in the
 
05:44:26.948 --> 05:44:26.958 align:start position:0%
farmers markets you're just a
 
05:44:28.548 --> 05:44:28.558 align:start position:0%
you're just a distiller that produces
 
05:44:31.350 --> 05:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
less than some others so it really
 
05:44:31.360 --> 05:44:32.230 align:start position:0%
less than some others so it really
offers

05:44:32.230 --> 05:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
offers
 
05:44:34.230 --> 05:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for new businesses to get
 
05:44:34.240 --> 05:44:35.110 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for new businesses to get
in

05:44:35.110 --> 05:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:44:36.948 --> 05:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
it certainly would because they are a
 
05:44:38.948 --> 05:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
distiller they would still be able to
 
05:44:41.350 --> 05:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
get into the farmers market
 
05:44:41.360 --> 05:44:43.030 align:start position:0%
get into the farmers market
business

05:44:43.030 --> 05:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
business
 
05:44:44.470 --> 05:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
but they would need to adhere to the
 
05:44:46.150 --> 05:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
quantity limits that are part of this
 
05:44:46.160 --> 05:44:51.030 align:start position:0%
quantity limits that are part of this
amendment

05:44:51.030 --> 05:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:52.868 --> 05:44:52.878 align:start position:0%
no questions thank you
 
05:44:55.830 --> 05:44:55.840 align:start position:0%

[Laughter]
 
05:45:15.270 --> 05:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
um my name is brian ferguson i am the
 
05:45:16.230 --> 05:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
president of the new hampshire craft
 
05:45:17.670 --> 05:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
spirits organization i'm here on their
 
05:45:18.948 --> 05:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
behalf today
 
05:45:18.958 --> 05:45:21.190 align:start position:0%
behalf today
um

05:45:21.190 --> 05:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:23.110 --> 05:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
05:45:24.708 --> 05:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
basically be would be repeating
 
05:45:27.510 --> 05:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
essentially what uh senator uh rebecca
 
05:45:29.190 --> 05:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
perkins cuoco said
 
05:45:29.200 --> 05:45:30.788 align:start position:0%
perkins cuoco said
um

05:45:30.788 --> 05:45:30.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:32.150 --> 05:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm not gonna read everything i had
 
05:45:33.270 --> 05:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
written because it's just about the
 
05:45:35.110 --> 05:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
exact same thing as that uh the one
 
05:45:38.310 --> 05:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
thing i would bring up is you had uh
 
05:45:40.070 --> 05:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs i believe you
 
05:45:42.150 --> 05:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
had brought up um it being two ounces we
 
05:45:44.390 --> 05:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
had reduced that from two ounces to to
 
05:45:46.548 --> 05:45:46.558 align:start position:0%
one and a half ounces uh in conjunction
 
05:45:48.390 --> 05:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
with a uh working relation our working
 
05:45:49.430 --> 05:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
relationship with the national
 
05:45:49.440 --> 05:45:50.390 align:start position:0%
relationship with the national
commission

05:45:50.390 --> 05:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
commission
 
05:45:50.400 --> 05:45:52.230 align:start position:0%
commission
um

05:45:52.230 --> 05:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:54.868 --> 05:45:54.878 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to uh to take any uh take
 
05:45:56.310 --> 05:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
05:45:58.628 --> 05:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
we're obviously in support of the bill
 
05:46:01.350 --> 05:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
and and think it would bring a
 
05:46:04.230 --> 05:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
a lot to the new hampshire craft spirits
 
05:46:04.240 --> 05:46:06.548 align:start position:0%
a lot to the new hampshire craft spirits
producers

05:46:06.548 --> 05:46:06.558 align:start position:0%
producers
 
05:46:07.910 --> 05:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
and a lot to this data would give us an
 
05:46:09.030 --> 05:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to produce more revenue
 
05:46:14.470 --> 05:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:17.590 --> 05:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
okay see no questions
 
05:46:17.600 --> 05:46:18.390 align:start position:0%
okay see no questions
thank

05:46:18.390 --> 05:46:18.400 align:start position:0%

thank you

distillery

05:46:36.628 --> 05:46:36.638 align:start position:0%
distillery
 
05:46:38.310 --> 05:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
which i have not had the opportunity to
 
05:46:40.470 --> 05:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
visit yet
 
05:46:42.070 --> 05:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman you're certainly
 
05:46:44.070 --> 05:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
always welcome to come visit uh and
 
05:46:45.510 --> 05:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you the rest of the committee i'll
 
05:46:49.030 --> 05:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
be brief obviously the day's wearing on
 
05:46:50.470 --> 05:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
i wanted really just to focus on
 
05:46:52.070 --> 05:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
emphasizing the importance of gaining
 
05:46:55.270 --> 05:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
access to the farmers markets
 
05:46:57.270 --> 05:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
we happen to be a certified organic
 
05:46:59.510 --> 05:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
distillery and so the opportunity to get
 
05:47:02.230 --> 05:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
out and meet fellow granite staters that
 
05:47:04.150 --> 05:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
value local organic
 
05:47:07.030 --> 05:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
products is uh very important to us
 
05:47:09.350 --> 05:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
we also think that what we've been told
 
05:47:11.350 --> 05:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
from the organizers of the farmers
 
05:47:13.030 --> 05:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
markets reef contact is that having a
 
05:47:14.628 --> 05:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
diversity of products
 
05:47:16.548 --> 05:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
at their markets
 
05:47:18.708 --> 05:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
strengthens the marketplace for the
 
05:47:20.788 --> 05:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
already existing providers
 
05:47:23.350 --> 05:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
more more customers are interested and
 
05:47:27.030 --> 05:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:29.990 --> 05:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
to address that that bottle number it
 
05:47:32.788 --> 05:47:32.798 align:start position:0%
really was just standardizing the the
 
05:47:34.390 --> 05:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
units um
 
05:47:37.190 --> 05:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a
 
05:47:39.190 --> 05:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
there's a trend at the federal level
 
05:47:40.628 --> 05:47:40.638 align:start position:0%
to allow
 
05:47:43.910 --> 05:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
a variety of sizes of bottles and so the
 
05:47:46.390 --> 05:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
proliferation of bottle sizes is only
 
05:47:48.230 --> 05:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
going to get worse
 
05:47:49.830 --> 05:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
it comes from people who sell into
 
05:47:51.990 --> 05:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
different countries a lot of metric
 
05:47:53.270 --> 05:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
friendly sizes but you're going to see
 
05:47:55.190 --> 05:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
all kinds of different bottle sizes and
 
05:47:58.070 --> 05:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
so by by running laws as nine liter
 
05:47:59.750 --> 05:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
equivalents then you don't have to worry
 
05:48:01.750 --> 05:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
about people gaming the rules by
 
05:48:03.350 --> 05:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
offering really big or really small
 
05:48:05.350 --> 05:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
bottles and so that's that's what that
 
05:48:05.360 --> 05:48:06.628 align:start position:0%
bottles and so that's that's what that
was

05:48:06.628 --> 05:48:06.638 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:48:07.990 --> 05:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
an attempt to be
 
05:48:11.270 --> 05:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
the same amount of alcohol uh just in a
 
05:48:12.628 --> 05:48:12.638 align:start position:0%
unit that you don't have to worry about
 
05:48:14.628 --> 05:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
the individual bottles
 
05:48:14.638 --> 05:48:15.510 align:start position:0%
the individual bottles
so

05:48:15.510 --> 05:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:48:16.948 --> 05:48:16.958 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions i'm happy to
 
05:48:18.310 --> 05:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
answer them otherwise i won't take more
 
05:48:25.430 --> 05:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:27.910 --> 05:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
05:48:29.990 --> 05:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
farmer's markets are you involved in a
 
05:48:31.750 --> 05:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
farmer's market
 
05:48:34.150 --> 05:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
no well probably not
 
05:48:36.708 --> 05:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
yeah so we went uh we went to our local
 
05:48:38.788 --> 05:48:38.798 align:start position:0%
farmers market twice last fall
 
05:48:40.390 --> 05:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
before it was realized that we crossed
 
05:48:42.708 --> 05:48:42.718 align:start position:0%
the 10 000 bottle
 
05:48:42.718 --> 05:48:44.390 align:start position:0%
the 10 000 bottle
produced

05:48:44.390 --> 05:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
produced
 
05:48:46.070 --> 05:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
threshold so the original legislation
 
05:48:47.830 --> 05:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
passed last year
 
05:48:50.470 --> 05:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
it it limited your ability to go to the
 
05:48:51.990 --> 05:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
market based on what you produce not
 
05:48:54.070 --> 05:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
based on what you sell
 
05:48:55.510 --> 05:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
which once you produce it the next thing
 
05:48:57.670 --> 05:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
you want to do is sell it so it kind of
 
05:49:00.470 --> 05:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
put us in an awkward situation
 
05:49:02.310 --> 05:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
certainly the two times we went we were
 
05:49:04.310 --> 05:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
very well received
 
05:49:08.070 --> 05:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
by both customers and fellow vendors
 
05:49:10.548 --> 05:49:10.558 align:start position:0%
and uh just a follow-up when you go to
 
05:49:13.990 --> 05:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh farmers market markets um i guess it
 
05:49:15.750 --> 05:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
probably depends on the farmers markets
 
05:49:17.670 --> 05:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
but are there
 
05:49:20.230 --> 05:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
a few distilleries that are represented
 
05:49:23.110 --> 05:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
is that commonplace well so we went as
 
05:49:25.510 --> 05:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
soon as the law was passed um and so we
 
05:49:27.510 --> 05:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
were the only ones because the law was
 
05:49:30.390 --> 05:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
literally days old um
 
05:49:32.070 --> 05:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
i i don't i don't know how many will
 
05:49:34.390 --> 05:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
participate going forward
 
05:49:37.030 --> 05:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
so that's yet to be seen i i can tell
 
05:49:39.110 --> 05:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
you though that in other states
 
05:49:41.590 --> 05:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
especially vermont is kind of a poster
 
05:49:41.600 --> 05:49:42.788 align:start position:0%
especially vermont is kind of a poster
child

05:49:42.788 --> 05:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
child
 
05:49:44.470 --> 05:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
the farmer's market is the primary way
 
05:49:47.670 --> 05:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
to market for most craft distillers
 
05:49:49.430 --> 05:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
they sell far more at farmers markets
 
05:49:50.868 --> 05:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
than they do in their own tasting rooms
 
05:49:53.590 --> 05:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
or through the agency stores
 
05:49:55.430 --> 05:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a very important and
 
05:49:58.310 --> 05:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
well-developed model to
 
05:50:00.390 --> 05:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
introduce your products
 
05:50:03.030 --> 05:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
to consumers um
 
05:50:04.948 --> 05:50:04.958 align:start position:0%
we pay taxes on any sales at farmers
 
05:50:06.708 --> 05:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
markets but hopefully the point is that
 
05:50:08.868 --> 05:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
they will like the products and then go
 
05:50:11.110 --> 05:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
to their new hampshire state uh wine and
 
05:50:15.110 --> 05:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:17.350 --> 05:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
and uh one more question here should we
 
05:50:19.510 --> 05:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
follow up the um
 
05:50:21.990 --> 05:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
maine new hampshire expo
 
05:50:25.510 --> 05:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
yeah are distilleries represented there
 
05:50:25.520 --> 05:50:26.310 align:start position:0%
yeah are distilleries represented there
so

05:50:26.310 --> 05:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:50:28.868 --> 05:50:28.878 align:start position:0%
can they be i i don't know if they can
 
05:50:30.470 --> 05:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
be my understanding is that they
 
05:50:31.910 --> 05:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
probably cannot because we probably
 
05:50:33.510 --> 05:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
don't have the license
 
05:50:35.910 --> 05:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah i was actually thinking that if
 
05:50:37.750 --> 05:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
this passes and it would be a good
 
05:50:39.190 --> 05:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
05:50:41.270 --> 05:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh to see whether or not we'd be
 
05:50:42.788 --> 05:50:42.798 align:start position:0%
allowed to participate in the future i
 
05:50:43.990 --> 05:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
think for this year that's not going to
 
05:50:44.000 --> 05:50:45.350 align:start position:0%
think for this year that's not going to
happen

05:50:45.350 --> 05:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
happen
 
05:50:49.990 --> 05:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:52.548 --> 05:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
well seeing no more questions thank you
 
05:50:56.470 --> 05:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:59.590 --> 05:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
okay i have one final card
 
05:51:02.948 --> 05:51:02.958 align:start position:0%

that reflects
 
05:51:42.558 --> 05:51:43.510 align:start position:0%
that reflects
what

05:52:09.750 --> 05:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
five years ago moral farm dairy was not
 
05:52:12.070 --> 05:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
growing grain for the spirits or the
 
05:52:13.750 --> 05:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
beer trade
 
05:52:16.070 --> 05:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
about five years ago when we founded the
 
05:52:19.270 --> 05:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
craft spirits organization
 
05:52:19.280 --> 05:52:20.548 align:start position:0%
craft spirits organization
we

05:52:20.548 --> 05:52:20.558 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:52:23.110 --> 05:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
made an effort to
 
05:52:25.190 --> 05:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
encourage our members to purchase
 
05:52:27.270 --> 05:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
locally if they could possibly find a
 
05:52:28.708 --> 05:52:28.718 align:start position:0%
way to do so
 
05:52:31.110 --> 05:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh this is personal for me i grew up on
 
05:52:32.948 --> 05:52:32.958 align:start position:0%
a dairy farm that went out of business
 
05:52:37.910 --> 05:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:40.628 --> 05:52:40.638 align:start position:0%
moral farm dairy three years ago put in
 
05:52:42.150 --> 05:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
about an eighteen
 
05:52:45.030 --> 05:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
hundred pound uh eighteen hundred bushel
 
05:52:47.590 --> 05:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
elevator for storing grain
 
05:52:49.750 --> 05:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
last year they put in two
 
05:52:52.948 --> 05:52:52.958 align:start position:0%
5 000 bushel grain elevators
 
05:52:55.430 --> 05:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
this year they're putting in more than
 
05:52:57.350 --> 05:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
twice that
 
05:53:00.788 --> 05:53:00.798 align:start position:0%
most of this is for the beer trade and
 
05:53:02.548 --> 05:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
they're sending it to
 
05:53:06.230 --> 05:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
malting houses in massachusetts and in
 
05:53:08.788 --> 05:53:08.798 align:start position:0%
maine to be malted
 
05:53:11.190 --> 05:53:11.200 align:start position:0%

the wine
 
05:54:03.430 --> 05:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
the distilled spirits and farmers
 
05:54:06.390 --> 05:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
markets ever since the beginning
 
05:54:08.548 --> 05:54:08.558 align:start position:0%
and i've seen this grow
 
05:54:10.868 --> 05:54:10.878 align:start position:0%
i was on the
 
05:54:13.110 --> 05:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
alcohol tourism commission
 
05:54:15.270 --> 05:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
with brian
 
05:54:18.230 --> 05:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
and a lot of what's going on now is some
 
05:54:20.470 --> 05:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
of the outcomes that we were talking
 
05:54:20.480 --> 05:54:21.350 align:start position:0%
of the outcomes that we were talking
about

05:54:21.350 --> 05:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:54:23.190 --> 05:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
two and three years ago but there was
 
05:54:26.548 --> 05:54:26.558 align:start position:0%
never a final report issued
 
05:54:28.548 --> 05:54:28.558 align:start position:0%
but these guys are taking the bull by
 
05:54:30.948 --> 05:54:30.958 align:start position:0%
the horns and doing this
 
05:54:32.788 --> 05:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
and uh i just thought he would share
 
05:54:34.150 --> 05:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
that with you

is just an informal question i'm just
 
05:54:57.110 --> 05:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
curious um how much
 
05:54:59.990 --> 05:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
of what you've produced
 
05:55:01.910 --> 05:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
is sold in new hampshire and how much
 
05:55:04.708 --> 05:55:04.718 align:start position:0%
