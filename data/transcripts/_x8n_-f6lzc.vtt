00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
dealing with these four uh bills which
 
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
are addressing the adequacy or swep and
 
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 align:start position:0%
um today we're going to try to come out
 
00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 align:start position:0%
of here with some recommendations on all
 
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 align:start position:0%
four bills for the subcommittee members
 
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
to take back to the policy Committee in
 
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
education which then we'll probably go
 
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
through the same discussion on the
 
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.950 align:start position:0%
through the same discussion on the
education

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
committee so I want to go through the
 
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
paperwork that was just handed out to
 
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody has a
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
copy uh does everybody now the sheets
 
00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 align:start position:0%
which just have just been passed out
 
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
there are several sheets which
 
00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 align:start position:0%
reflect the formula how it was done with
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
the esbrook study back in 2008 for the
 
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
base cost and so there's one sheet there
 
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
which you can see on the back side where
 
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
it has the uh recommended uh base cost
 
00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
the universal cost at 4,000 on the first
 
00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:16.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:19.759 align:start position:0%
4,529 that you if you have that sheet
 
00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
that's not the one with the scratch outs
 
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
one stapled it's stapled that's right
 
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
and there's more in that packet there's
 
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
also attach that packet um some two
 
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
tables on the next sheet in that packet
 
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.550 align:start position:0%
tables on the next sheet in that packet
which

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
reflect top one is a uh some information
 
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
that I got from the director of uh
 
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
special education at the doe uh director
 
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
fet and below it there's uh some further
 
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 align:start position:0%
information which takes the total cost
 
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
of these three categories we'll be
 
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
addressing them uh on the third sheet in
 
00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 align:start position:0%
that packet
 
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 align:start position:0%
IT addresses the um issue of of uh the
 
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
weighted for special education in the
 
00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
that in the old formula but it gives
 
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
three weights um based upon the base
 
00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:16.759 align:start position:0%
cost on the per sheet of
 
00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
$4,525 and we'll discuss that and the
 
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
the last one addresses the issue of the
 
00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
base cost of
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
$10,000 which if something came out
 
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
that's how we probably make some changes
 
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
the other sheet which you have here this
 
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
one the difference between this one and
 
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
the one you just looked at is that and
 
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
the one you looked at first when you go
 
00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
right to the top of it and that stapled
 
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
copy you can see the ratio K through 2
 
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
has been changed to 1 to 23 St and and
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
right now it's 1 to 25 based upon that
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
old formula U that one where where we
 
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:02.360 align:start position:0%
came out with that Universal cost of
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
4529 um is built on a ratio 1 to 23 and
 
00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
a ratio 1 to 28 the one that's crossed
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
out is based upon everything the way it
 
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
is in that 2008 report 1 to 25 1 to 30
 
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
and you see by doing that but the same
 
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
salary is at the top of it the the
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
outcome would drop it down in amount for
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
base cost to
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
$444 um the we'll be talking about these
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
how the the initial salary was gotten
 
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.430 align:start position:0%
how the the initial salary was gotten
the

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
$2,560 how that was gotten uh arrived at
 
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
which is statistically generated and the
 
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
other sheets which you see uh I think
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
you'll see this sheet right here we'll
 
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
be talking about it um it's the one that
 
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
deals with the um base cost if we used
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
$444 um and there's supported data
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
attached to that one so this is some
 
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:07.160 align:start position:0%
information that's we we should discuss
 
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
here today before we take any action on
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
anything um and then uh there should be
 
00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:14.519 align:start position:0%
also a sheet that you receive like this
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
which are the revenues which were
 
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
provided to finance yesterday what's in
 
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
fund they where where the sources of
 
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
those revenues are and where in the
 
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
Appropriations so that I'm sure
 
00:09:33.069 --> 00:09:33.079 align:start position:0%
uh represent em was discussing yesterday
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
and representative Heath and um there's
 
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
another sheet which you should have this
 
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
one was just provided to us by
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative fellows and it looks
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
going back further than 2008 to 2004 and
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
deals with the fiscal capacity disparity
 
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
I call that that the name for represent
 
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
FAL you say was targeted a so but we
 
00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
will at that when we want to look at
 
00:09:59.230 --> 00:09:59.240 align:start position:0%
this we'll invite representative um
 
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
fellows up as she was working at doe at
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
this time I'm familiar with
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
it okay and also we have asked to come
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
forward to this meeting Mark is here
 
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
from the Department you have some
 
00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets for us also so I'd like to
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
go through your spreadsheets first Mark
 
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
so then if you want to clear out you can
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
clear out but um do you have those
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets available for
 
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
us yeah why don't we come on up and take
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
care of that stuff I does everybody have
 
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
a copy of these four bills in your
 
00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:34.519 align:start position:0%
packet of materials you should have
 
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
those and also there was another
 
00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
information which we did have I passed
 
00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:40.839 align:start position:0%
out one meeting I'm going to show you
 
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
that because we'll be referencing
 
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
referencing this during the course of
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
our discussion there was a sheet which
 
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
we had that we had data data provided to
 
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
us by research here in the house it has
 
00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
the where we got this cost for the the
 
00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
starting salary of a teacher in the
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire which is $
 
00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:07.839 align:start position:0%
42,5 7 and it identifies all the
 
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
districts in the state and what their
 
00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:12.279 align:start position:0%
their contracted levels are at and where
 
00:11:13.949 --> 00:11:13.959 align:start position:0%
they're starting so you can see there's
 
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
a number of them which are starting much
 
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
lower than that figure unfortunately and
 
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
some that are above it so this is the
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
average of that so we'll be referencing
 
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
that sheet when we talk about some of
 
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
stuff I thought I had handed out this
 
00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:31.639 align:start position:0%
once before I don't see that in my
 
00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:34.839 align:start position:0%
packet okay Jen can we get copies made
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
of this I'll take down yeah because it
 
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
it lists all the districts within it too
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
from the high to the
 
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.389 align:start position:0%
from the high to the
low

00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
yeah okay okay we're getting
 
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
you as you look over this I just want
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
to you know I was asked to look at the
 
00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:14.030 align:start position:0%
to you know I was asked to look at the
2008

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
2008
 
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:17.240 align:start position:0%
Formula and try to modernize it and U
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
I'll just prose this by this is kind of
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
more of an academic
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
exercise cut school funding by 200
 
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
million so I don't think it's going to
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
be something that you're interested in
 
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:29.240 align:start position:0%
but but as an academic exercise talk
 
00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:31.079 align:start position:0%
about it some of the concepts yeah
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
that's what we like to talk these
 
00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.030 align:start position:0%
that's what we like to talk these
Concepts

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
Concepts
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
involved the old
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
formula is very
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.839 --> 00:13:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
in

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
so just looking at the big spreadsheet
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:33.590 align:start position:0%
 
out

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
um this has median family income which
 
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
is not how we use we don't use median
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
family income in the current Formula um
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
median family income is used to sort of
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
identify towns that might be wealthy
 
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:49.240 align:start position:0%
meaning um it bars any town that has an
 
00:13:52.269 --> 00:13:52.279 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation per pupil um over
 
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
the state average and it bars um you
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
have to if you meet that condition so
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
your evpp is over over the state average
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
meaning you have a lot of property
 
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
wealth relative to students and if your
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
median family income is above
 
00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
150% of median U 150% of the median
 
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
family income um if your community is
 
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
you're barred from targeted Aid targeted
 
00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:17.959 align:start position:0%
Aid is the last section of this formula
 
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
so it was used as a vehicle to a
 
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
mechanism to identify communities that
 
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
had high income and borrow them from the
 
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
formula uh I will say this as I look I I
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
got this data from Phil Lenton with the
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
fiscal policy Institute if you want to
 
00:14:32.749 --> 00:14:32.759 align:start position:0%
dive into this data in more detail I
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
would recommend bringing in Phil slon um
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
my how do you say name Phil slon s l
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
tteen so um talking with Phil a little
 
00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:45.759 align:start position:0%
bit and he can speak in more detail he
 
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
said his concerns are the margin of
 
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
error in this data and so Statewide when
 
00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
you look at uh median family income in
 
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's
 
00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:55.759 align:start position:0%
110k but the margin of error on average
 
00:14:58.269 --> 00:14:58.279 align:start position:0%
is around 20K so that would mean in this
 
00:14:59.710 --> 00:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
data said you would not be able to
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
delineate or distinguish between a
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
990,000 per year family and 130,000 year
 
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
per family and so when you're just kind
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
of looking over 150% above um maybe
 
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
maybe that doesn't that margin of error
 
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
isn't much of an issue but it seems kind
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
of just on its face a large issue as far
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
as you know if you met a family that
 
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
made 90k versus 130k you would think
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
there's a wide Gap there 40K um so that
 
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
that one of the challenges with this
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
data it's based on US Census Data has a
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
90% confidence interval um Phil slen can
 
00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
talk about the statistics in more detail
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
but that margin of error is definitely
 
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
real and it's reflected um you're seeing
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
a number but that number has a margin of
 
00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:44.440 align:start position:0%
error behind it that's uh pretty
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
substantial um but this 2008 Formula
 
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
does use median family income so the
 
00:15:52.749 --> 00:15:52.759 align:start position:0%
section that's highlighted light blue is
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
the first there's three Aid components
 
00:15:56.309 --> 00:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
there's actually a hold harmless in here
 
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
that I did not um try to recreate um but
 
00:16:03.389 --> 00:16:03.399 align:start position:0%
this is um how big was that whole D it
 
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't very big not very big 24
 
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
28,000 million million yeah it wasn't it
 
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't stabilization size yeah it was it
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
was sort of small potatoes relative to
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
some of the bigger hold harmlessness
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
we've seen um so this this light blue
 
00:16:22.829 --> 00:16:22.839 align:start position:0%
section is local tax capacity Aid and it
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
works really similar to fiscal capacity
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid um so basically what how
 
00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:30.279 align:start position:0%
this part of the formula works is you
 
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
take your evpp so your equalized
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
valuation over property uh sorry
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation over pupils so
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
that's basically your tax base over how
 
00:16:42.309 --> 00:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
many students you have and it looks it
 
00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
gets the average the average currently
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
is around 1.5 million so each student
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
has about 1.5 million of a tax base um
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh for the state average and so if your
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
your community's evpp is below that
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
number so say you had a low tax base
 
00:17:01.389 --> 00:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
relative to students say you're at
 
00:17:05.549 --> 00:17:05.559 align:start position:0%
750k and the average is 100 1.5 million
 
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
then that diff variance is now measured
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
the difference between your number below
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
the average and the average so if we had
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
a community with a low um I'll pick on
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh Berlin is around 760k so just to make
 
00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:23.319 align:start position:0%
the math easy um let's say it's 750k and
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
let's say the average is 1.5 million
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
because it's near 1.5 million so when we
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
get that number it's about 750k so we
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
get that 750k number and then we
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
multiply it by the average local Ed tax
 
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
rate which is $10 sorry but we we don't
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
time it times it by $10 per thousand
 
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
well we times it by a in the form of a
 
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
percentage so $10 per thousand is 1% so
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
we do 1% of that uh 1% of that variance
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
between the average evpp and Berland's
 
00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
evpp and we get um around 7,500 per
 
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
student so that's the aid amount per
 
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
student they're going to get and then we
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
multiply it by uh the number of students
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
and that's how local tax capacity Aid
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
works so it's kind of similar to fiscal
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity Aid except since you
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
really depends on your evpp which is
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
what fiscal capacity disparity Aid it's
 
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
a different program it's local tax
 
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
capacity Aid because in the grant is
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
determined by the local spend the local
 
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
sorry the local tax effort so it's an
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
interesting concept um since it was
 
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
enacted in 2008 and now I'm using the
 
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
same exact formula I'm bringing you
 
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
today's terms um it's doubled in size so
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
in 2008 it was around 200 million we
 
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
also had a lot less property values back
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
then and so um the sort of neat thing
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
about this concept and we're studying
 
00:18:55.149 --> 00:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
this kind of from an academic purpose um
 
00:18:59.549 --> 00:18:59.559 align:start position:0%
as property values grow so say your evpp
 
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
became 2 million and you're you're
 
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
you're now Berlin and you're 50% of that
 
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
you would be 1 million so now the
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
variance is 1 million and if say you
 
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
times that by 1% you know you would have
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
a higher uh Aid amount per student so it
 
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
this formula has a decent float
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
mechanism in a sense it would float with
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
property growth um if you wanted to do
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity a as you
 
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
implemented it in 2021 um you have to
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
modify the grant amounts and you have to
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
modify evpp amount so um this formula as
 
00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919 align:start position:0%
a concept seems to achieve that sort of
 
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity objective um in in in
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
modern format it seems to um I didn't
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
see any issues with it as far as
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
modernizing it I could I could use it as
 
00:19:45.039 --> 00:19:46.950 align:start position:0%
modernizing it I could I could use it as
is

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
um the only um thing I would when I was
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
thinking about how this could create
 
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
challenges is is
 
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh if there's a lot of federal money
 
00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
coming in or local local taxes are up if
 
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
local taxes are up let's say let's say
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
local taxes are up high local taxes on
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
the on the communities are up that local
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
Ed average tax rate would increase which
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
would then increase state aid and if
 
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
state aid was increased um potentially
 
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
the tax rate would lower so it create
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
this kind of can you can Mark can you
 
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
tell us how this would impact a
 
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
community like Lincoln where where their
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
property values are high yeah but the
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
average income is probably low so of the
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
person working you know at the hourly
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
wage so Lincoln is considered has a has
 
00:20:35.789 --> 00:20:35.799 align:start position:0%
a Rel their tax base relative to their
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
students is pretty
 
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
high yeah yeah Lincoln Lincoln does not
 
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
qualify for this because their equalized
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
valuation per student is 10 million so
 
00:20:48.909 --> 00:20:48.919 align:start position:0%
just like fiscal capacity disparity a
 
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
Lincoln would not under however you conr
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
that construct that um Lincoln is
 
00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:55.240 align:start position:0%
considered has a high tax base relative
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
to students and so fiscal capacity
 
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid doesn't apply to them
 
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
um they're also in the 2008 Formula
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
they're not eligible for targeted Aid
 
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
because their evpp is High um even
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
income Lincoln's median family income
 
00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.310 align:start position:0%
income Lincoln's median family income
let's

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
let's
 
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
see 95k so just below average so uh just
 
00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:21.799 align:start position:0%
below the state average yeah you know
 
00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:24.919 align:start position:0%
within the margin of error but um yeah
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's so Lincoln doesn't qualify for
 
00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:27.799 align:start position:0%
actually they they get a zero Grant I
 
00:21:27.799 --> 00:21:29.070 align:start position:0%
actually they they get a zero Grant I
believe

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
I look at this Mr chairman yes I so if
 
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
we were funding education based on an
 
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
income tax that would make a difference
 
00:21:39.549 --> 00:21:39.559 align:start position:0%
for Lincoln but since the source of our
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
funds is property you have to go to the
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
question of what the valuation is yeah
 
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:47.240 align:start position:0%
there's that's that's why that
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
distinction right it depends on what
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
your source is if you're funding from
 
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
income then it makes a difference what
 
00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
the average income is if you're sourcing
 
00:21:58.269 --> 00:21:58.279 align:start position:0%
from property makes a difference what
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
the average property is and income
 
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.110 align:start position:0%
the average property is and income
becomes

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
irrelevant yeah so um I know House
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
Education house finance has had those
 
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
policy discussions on when building
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
designing formulas what metric is most
 
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
important to you in determining it and
 
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
properties always in the conversation
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
and then typically also in the
 
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
conversation is fnr counts so that's how
 
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
we've done things currently um but yeah
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
that that that policy discussion is it
 
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
comes up
 
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
often yeah where where the two meet here
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
so we yeah yes represent
 
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
Ames um Mark I maybe you you spoke to
 
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
this but uh under the um old 2008
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
Formula there was the calculation that
 
00:22:46.269 --> 00:22:46.279 align:start position:0%
was based on EVP P yep and then there
 
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
was a cut off that was based on income
 
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
medium income and so a town like
 
00:22:55.269 --> 00:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
Brookline as I recall just like a your
 
00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
updated data come come comes across as
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
very eligible for the targeted aid until
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
it hits the wall of ineligibility
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
for for targeted because it's got a high
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
median income yes yeah so the way I you
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
I pulled up an old law book and I and I
 
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
you know I didn't go through it like
 
00:23:18.269 --> 00:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
multiple times normally if I really
 
00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to vet this thing out and I would
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
do a lot of quality control but I
 
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
believe my understanding of the 2008 law
 
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
is the local tax Aid local Ed tax um uh
 
00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:29.720 align:start position:0%
tax capacity Aid would be Brookline is
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
eligible for that um yeah but you're
 
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
right the targeted Aid is when you bring
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
in family income brookline's now out of
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
it and to take a bigger Town Bedford
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
which has a very high income um I don't
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
actually know brine will but Bedford
 
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
does and Bedford is eligible for the aid
 
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
until you hit
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
that nope you can't get it because your
 
00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
income's too high right
 
00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
mhm yeah Bedford is uh let's see where
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
effs at um yeah their income 176 U
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
medium family income so and that's where
 
00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:05.559 align:start position:0%
we bump into this problem of uh the data
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
isn't good because you know the cut off
 
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
now well maybe they shouldn't be cut off
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
because uh maybe they're in that
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
20% absolutely yeah so if I if I I don't
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
have it in I mean I have it in my
 
00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
computer but if I looked at the margin
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
of error on that Bedford data there's a
 
00:24:25.389 --> 00:24:25.399 align:start position:0%
way to read it that they're eligible and
 
00:24:26.389 --> 00:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
then there's a way to read because the
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
margin of error so yeah or they or
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
they're even further um I was actually
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
reading the income data they just um I
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
think they just gave up in Newcastle
 
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
they just said greater than
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
250k so um so to me it always made sense
 
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
to have that cut that that uh
 
00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
firewall with so the wealthier towns
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
even though we don't have an income tax
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
um but they have other ways I may it's
 
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
easier to raise taxes perhaps in that or
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
property taxes in that Community than in
 
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
other communities maybe that's the idea
 
00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
um and to have that cut off but then you
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
come up come up against this problem of
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
the data is not good and so you're using
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
something that has a big impact and uh
 
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
and it may be a maybe making a
 
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
mistake yeah um from my perspective
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
although we have a lot of problems with
 
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
the fnr data and struggles with the fnr
 
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
data it it rolls in a little bit cleaner
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
um than Census Data cuz census St is
 
00:25:30.909 --> 00:25:30.919 align:start position:0%
based on survey um fnr data is backed by
 
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
um you know U documentation that the
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
student is eligible uh and we've had
 
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
these conversations for for years so
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
represent luno you had your thank you
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair and thanks Mark for
 
00:25:45.389 --> 00:25:45.399 align:start position:0%
again for your your um very complete
 
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
analysis here and and this is terrific I
 
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to follow up on something that
 
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury said uh just a
 
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
few minutes ago and also last week too
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
where you where you sort of cautioned on
 
00:25:58.909 --> 00:25:58.919 align:start position:0%
the average and which is which is really
 
00:26:00.909 --> 00:26:00.919 align:start position:0%
important I think particularly when
 
00:26:04.389 --> 00:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
looking at at household incomes uh
 
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
because while while the property
 
00:26:09.389 --> 00:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
valuation of a of a community is
 
00:26:10.909 --> 00:26:10.919 align:start position:0%
essentially the
 
00:26:15.389 --> 00:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
community's ability to to access um
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
resources um a um the the income is not
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
done on a community basis it's really on
 
00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
a a household by household basis because
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
there going to be a large variability
 
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919 align:start position:0%
you know across um AC there may there's
 
00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
going to be an average but there's going
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
to be a tremendous you know variability
 
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh on that and uh and I think it it it
 
00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:36.919 align:start position:0%
goes back to I think something we've
 
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
we've talked about and it has been
 
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
incorporated into couple of these
 
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
proposals a um um low and moderate
 
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
income property tax you know relief
 
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
program that is very much income sort of
 
00:26:53.389 --> 00:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
you know driven but um but you know at
 
00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
the end of the day in New Hampshire and
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
and I think across most St States um
 
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
school funding you know maybe not to the
 
00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
same degree we do here in New Hampshire
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
right now um does have a a large um um
 
00:27:12.669 --> 00:27:12.679 align:start position:0%
um school school funding has a large
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
portion of school funding does come from
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
you know local property um taxes and uh
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire you know we're at what
 
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
70% 75% coming from local property taxes
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
I think that's way higher than it than
 
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
it is on average but um but but being
 
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
able to to you know to do something here
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
that that uh and I think marks marks
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
laid it out particularly with with
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity and there's
 
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
different ways we can do fiscal capacity
 
00:27:45.549 --> 00:27:45.559 align:start position:0%
topair I think Mark's got a great
 
00:27:48.029 --> 00:27:48.039 align:start position:0%
example here where it was done on a more
 
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
of a sort of a a a um u a a local tax um
 
00:27:57.789 --> 00:27:57.799 align:start position:0%
uh effort or minimum effort that
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
expected you know for for every
 
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
community based on what its ability to
 
00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
access resources is and then a um uh a
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
targeted or directed low and moderate um
 
00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:14.039 align:start position:0%
income property tax relief program that
 
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
then focuses in on on uh a an individual
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
household's ability to access their own
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
resources to put towards to put towards
 
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
that so so uh I I guess in the end what
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sort of saying is that that you know
 
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
the spread what whatever we end up doing
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
I think is going to have a fair degree
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
of complexity um uh to it and just as
 
00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:39.799 align:start position:0%
what chair lad said you know you've got
 
00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:41.799 align:start position:0%
Lincoln's a great
 
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
example I mean ton of vacation homes
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
property wealth but but but very much
 
00:28:50.909 --> 00:28:50.919 align:start position:0%
average income and then you've got
 
00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
Bedford as representative Ames was
 
00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
talking about which is very high incomes
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
but you know Bedford I think is are they
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
the third we got a superintendent here
 
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
are they maybe the third largest
 
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:04.120 align:start position:0%
District in the state um no you've got
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
sorry der man oh Derry and Nash but
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
they're right there with five or six
 
00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
thousand kids I think 5,000 I think
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
they're like yeah but that's yeah but
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
but you know lot of income lot of lot of
 
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
high average income but a lot of kids
 
00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:24.039 align:start position:0%
which which puts a tremendous pre amount
 
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
of pressure on that equalized property
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
value per people so anyway sorry about
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
all the the stuff there but
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
SPS very interesting observations but I
 
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
would like to throw a few caveats in
 
00:29:43.149 --> 00:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
um first it's true that there's a lot of
 
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
disparity within any Community between
 
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
the low income and the high income
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
within the community I think that's in
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
income but real estate values in a very
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
loose and indirect way are appr proxy
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
for incomes where incomes are high
 
00:30:05.789 --> 00:30:05.799 align:start position:0%
property values are bit up where incomes
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
are low property values aren't well
 
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:13.640 align:start position:0%
supported so the property values are a
 
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
result of the total Expendable income
 
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
available to purchase and and service
 
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
and mortgage and so
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
on so when when we've chosen to use
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
property as our primary revenue Source
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
we basically go to a community and we
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
add up all of the
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
property um to create the grand list and
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
it's a pool right so the mill rate is is
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
derived from the pool and then it's
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
assigned proportionally to the
 
00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
individual owner's property which
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
actually works out well and makes
 
00:30:48.799 --> 00:30:50.470 align:start position:0%
actually works out well and makes
sense

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
but one thing I'm very uncomfortable
 
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
with and uh there's a component of it in
 
00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.470 align:start position:0%
with and uh there's a component of it in
1586

00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
1586
 
00:31:02.509 --> 00:31:02.519 align:start position:0%
is means testing attacks we means test a
 
00:31:05.549 --> 00:31:05.559 align:start position:0%
lot of social programs right we say
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to get an EFA or you're
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
going to get a a whatever depending on
 
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
what your income level is and there's
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
cut offs it's pretty much common
 
00:31:15.629 --> 00:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
practice but when you take something
 
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
like a property tax which is already
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
proportional and you're tax according to
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
the capacity to pay doesn't make much
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:27.950 align:start position:0%
 
me

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh 1586 I believe has a component does
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
it not oh it's it's your other build
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
does it I get 1586 has the swept reform
 
00:31:42.909 --> 00:31:42.919 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's got the low income the
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
low and monit income is based on income
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
that you've got to have in order to pay
 
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
the property tax that's the idea that
 
00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:54.559 align:start position:0%
they don't have your income is low then
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
you might not be able to pay the
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
property tax and then you might lose
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
your property so it's it's all related
 
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
to and I would contend that where that's
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
the case the real problem is that the
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
high right everyone acquires his own
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
home according to his means and then
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's taxed proportionately I think if we
 
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
unpeel it the real problem is too much
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
is writing on the property tax okay n
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
directed only to the
 
00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:45.430 align:start position:0%
directed only to the
state

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.389 align:start position:0%
 
not

00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
enough fair enough but the point I'm
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
trying to get to is is is when you find
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
yourself as a state on a policy level
 
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
having to make carve outs and means
 
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
testing you got to look at the
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
underlying problem which is that the
 
00:33:10.269 --> 00:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
property tax is too high and in the
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
towns where it's more likely that there
 
00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:17.799 align:start position:0%
would be a demand for a low uh income
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
credit those are the
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
towns where the burden is the greatest
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
okay I mean for example Charlestown and
 
00:33:27.549 --> 00:33:27.559 align:start position:0%
Claremont my neighbor
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely pop out on the first page
 
00:33:31.629 --> 00:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
without looking at all four pages I
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
think it would still be true if you
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
looked at all four pages they are just
 
00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:38.519 align:start position:0%
so far out of the
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
norm that they represent a problem for
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
the entire Community to afford the
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
property tax not just for a select few
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
with you know some kind of measurable
 
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.470 align:start position:0%
with you know some kind of measurable
low

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
low
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
income so um look at uh
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
the evpp I think it's a marvelous
 
00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
measure it bakes in so many
 
00:34:02.799 --> 00:34:04.549 align:start position:0%
measure it bakes in so many
things

00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
uh the evpp of Charlestown at
 
00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:13.750 align:start position:0%
uh the evpp of Charlestown at
562

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
562
 
00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
is half the average yeah that's that's
 
00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
near the bottom and a quarter of many of
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:27.950 align:start position:0%
 
example

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:29.720 align:start position:0%
and that that you know even though
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
you're a unifor rate to all property and
 
00:34:43.069 --> 00:34:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
high difference in their incomes may be
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
much greater than the difference in
 
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.869 align:start position:0%
much greater than the difference in
their

00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
property something that that that you
 
00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
somebody talk about you know property
 
00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
values are like this but income the
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
income spread across proper much wider
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
so you've got much greater you know
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
disparity in terms of in terms of any
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
owner's ability to
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
to to pay on that effort unifor
 
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.150 align:start position:0%
to to pay on that effort unifor
properer

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
properer
 
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
if I can just boil my comment down to to
 
00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
one simple proposition and I know this
 
00:35:35.069 --> 00:35:35.079 align:start position:0%
is fairly fundamental so it's hard to
 
00:35:35.079 --> 00:35:37.349 align:start position:0%
is fairly fundamental so it's hard to
get

00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
there when you have a tax
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
source that creates such disparate
 
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
results that we go to the length of
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
charting it in a chart this complex with
 
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
this many
 
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:54.280 align:start position:0%
variables what you're really looking at
 
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
is that you've got too much writing on
 
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:04.839 align:start position:0%
source and and I'm I'm trying to
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
redirect the conversation to how we
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
unburden real estate not to how we
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
rearrange it and then send State
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
subsidies to take account of it yeah
 
00:36:20.309 --> 00:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
agree yeah right now we're jumping into
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
the revenue and we're getting no ways of
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
doing that I apologize for my
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
perspective stick to policy here I know
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
you both did but now let's get back to
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
where we are
 
00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.109 align:start position:0%
where we are
Mark

00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
y question I think in this chart you
 
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
don't the local rate local got here is
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:03.829 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
okay there could be there could be an
 
00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
error I'm I'm not sure um I intended to
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
do yeah that's what yeah uh it should be
 
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
it should be tax effort over unequalized
 
00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:18.349 align:start position:0%
it should be tax effort over unequalized
tax

00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
base um one right
 
00:37:28.349 --> 00:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
here uh so the the I know the top number
 
00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
the top number is the one that matters
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
the one that you see next to your town
 
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
actually doesn't matter for the formula
 
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:41.309 --> 00:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
okay Mark do you have anything else on
 
00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
on the spreadsheet here yeah I'll just
 
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
be quick um The yellow section is
 
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
similar to the local capacity Aid except
 
00:37:50.829 --> 00:37:50.839 align:start position:0%
you take your EV average evpp without
 
00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
utilities and then you take your
 
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
community's average evpp without
 
00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
utilities and if you're under the
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
average whatever that variance is you
 
00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
apply the apply the swep tax rate that
 
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
gets you the aid per pupil and then you
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
multiply by the pupil so it's doing
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
almost the same function as the uh light
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
blue column except it's based on
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
non-utility tax base and it's the swept
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
rate um lastly the targeted part
 
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
is uh again like we said like we said
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's saying if your evpp is
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
above the average if you have 150% above
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
the median family income um both of
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
those apply you're not eligible
 
00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:30.200 align:start position:0%
and um then it has some targeted Aid
 
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
based on sped counts fnr counts English
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
language Learners and
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
transportation and um the law back then
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
said 3% or greater increase each year
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
and so I just applied the 3% for each of
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
the I think 16 years or some odd 16 um
 
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
some odd years to get up to the a modern
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
metric um the only sort of lesson I
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
think I learned from this is our formula
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
in 2008 was very targeted as you can see
 
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
um now and and the model we have
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
currently is a mix some targeted Aid on
 
00:39:02.349 --> 00:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
the right side of the formula some
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
targeted Aid on the left side of the
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
formula relative to fnr and sped but
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
every student has a base a amount um
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
there's no base Aid amount on this
 
00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
formula the closest thing to it is
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
transportation aid but communities with
 
00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:15.670 align:start position:0%
transportation aid but communities with
High

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
High
 
00:39:21.069 --> 00:39:21.079 align:start position:0%
evpp um and uh uh and family income uh
 
00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
are bar are barred from it so there's no
 
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
base Aid Universal base Aid that every
 
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
Community gets in this formula that is
 
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
why Alton my understanding is why Alton
 
00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
gets Z so some communities are not the
 
00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:35.800 align:start position:0%
current Formula has a base a amount that
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
every Community is sort of guaranteed um
 
00:39:41.069 --> 00:39:41.079 align:start position:0%
this formula was very targeted um so
 
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
just kind of a difference from back then
 
00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
to now um and that's just I don't know
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
another sort of History lesson there but
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's um where' you get that figure
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
314 on on your transportation out of the
 
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
base so so and I don't even know
 
00:39:58.589 --> 00:39:58.599 align:start position:0%
yeah well no it's from it's it's
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
actually coded in law in 2008 it says I
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
believe the number was 190 190 or
 
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
something so there's a number uh
 
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
hard-coded in law and I don't even know
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
if there was a I'm actually unsure if
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
there was an inflation metric to
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
increase that I actually I'd have to
 
00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
look at the law more carefully I added
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
an inflation metric to it of 3% each
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
year and so that bumped it up to
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
314 but that was pre2 2008 study
 
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
committee that looked into
 
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
transportation I believe all of this
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
would have C been codified in yeah I
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
based upon back that era that was part
 
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
of was added into the universal cost for
 
00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
a student and it was $362 I understand
 
00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
but so yeah the methodology on how they
 
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
got here um I mean I wasn't here so
 
00:40:51.069 --> 00:40:51.079 align:start position:0%
um someone might know it represented
 
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
fellows might know it
 
00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:56.839 align:start position:0%
okay and this sheet right here it it's
 
00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
just a a comparison with current law
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
between then and now yeah so it's $200
 
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
million uh decrease in school funding so
 
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
it's obviously not going to look
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
favorable to almost all communities um
 
00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
um the only interesting thing was gtown
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
and Rochester I think do better
 
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
and they just have really high uh uh
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
they just have the local tax capacity a
 
00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:23.839 align:start position:0%
is really I believe benefiting them um
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
maybe more so than the current Formula
 
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
that relies a lot fnr data so um gol so
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
for example golf toown has a pretty low
 
00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:32.839 align:start position:0%
poverty rate they have about a 15%
 
00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
poverty rate the state average is around
 
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
25% so our current Formula puts more
 
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
weight on poverty um and so this formula
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't and so they do a little bit
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
better in this formula but that's that's
 
00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
the only sort of compare and contrast I
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
could kind of find just doing a quick
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
analysis looks like a number of towns
 
00:41:58.829 --> 00:41:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
yeah they lose all um well Manchester is
 
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
just a big city so whatever happens
 
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
happen everything is going to be large
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
whatever happens to Manchester um but
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
yeah this the uh my understanding too is
 
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
excess swept was in play so a town
 
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
community like Alton what their full
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
swept would go um uh would go to the
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
state and they would so that's fun
 
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
funding they currently get to fund their
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
schools um and that would be gone yeah
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions on this
 
00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.910 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions on this
one

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
just real quickk when you talk about the
 
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
rate 25 that is
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
that yes
 
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
185% uh yes so you saying it's 25% is
 
00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
not used to be around 28% uh yeah it
 
00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
floats in that it floats in that range
 
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I don't last last time I
 
00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:50.190 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I don't last last time I
yeah

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions
 
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
from mark thank you very much took a
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
little bit of time to do this but
 
00:42:58.109 --> 00:42:58.119 align:start position:0%
present some information yeah it's it's
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
always good I mean there's always useful
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
to know the history and yeah uh just
 
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
following you now Sally you presented
 
00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
this other that you're you're going back
 
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
in history as well is there anything you
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
want to add to this or explain yours no
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:25.079 --> 00:43:28.109 align:start position:0%
 
up

00:43:28.109 --> 00:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:30.549 --> 00:43:30.559 align:start position:0%
trying to trying to uh talk about two
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
different ones at the same time would
 
00:43:35.069 --> 00:43:35.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:35.079 --> 00:43:37.270 align:start position:0%
 
challenge

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
so so you all have um spreadsheet even
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
own so this really dates
 
00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.710 align:start position:0%
own so this really dates
back

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.190 align:start position:0%
back
f504

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
f504
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
yes so one of the things I did in the
 
00:43:57.549 --> 00:43:57.559 align:start position:0%
past week is I did some research about
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
the availability of the and of um median
 
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
household um
 
00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:07.720 align:start position:0%
value and median household
 
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
income which is data that comes from the
 
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
Census and back when back in 2004 the
 
00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
data that was used was from the actual
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
10-year s
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
census and it was pretty good data
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
because in addition to working at the
 
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education I was at census
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
taker twice in 1980 and 1990 and at that
 
00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:35.720 align:start position:0%
time when you got to the smaller
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
communities like I worked in rumney and
 
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
in and Bridgewater they used the long
 
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
form census form which had huge numbers
 
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
of questions about income and all this
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff so that was pretty
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
accurate one of my concerns is that what
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
they do now and they've been doing for
 
00:44:59.790 --> 00:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
20 years is they do sampling every year
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
and so every year you can see new data
 
00:45:08.549 --> 00:45:08.559 align:start position:0%
on household income and um home
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
values but they also do every five years
 
00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
they look at five years of data and they
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
average that and then they adjust for
 
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
inflation and so that's pretty good data
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
because it makes the you know whatever
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
however many they sample in one year I
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
don't know what it is but your sampling
 
00:45:33.069 --> 00:45:33.079 align:start position:0%
pool is five times
 
00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
bigger and Phil slon I understand is
 
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
concerned about the margin of error they
 
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
do have margins of error but we've been
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
using equalized
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
valuation and that at least the census
 
00:45:53.549 --> 00:45:53.559 align:start position:0%
data has actual data equalized
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
valuation includes some
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
um objectivity issues
 
00:46:04.349 --> 00:46:04.359 align:start position:0%
because there are just so many variables
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
and really somebody's making that
 
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
determination it's based on that
 
00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation is all also based on
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
a sample the equalized valuation um is
 
00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
calculated looking at the number of
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
properties in a town that are sold every
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
year and comparing their assessed value
 
00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
to what it sells for and particularly
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
right now there are not many sales so
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
that's highly
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
variable you know with a large margin of
 
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
error so I think when it comes to school
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
funding you're going to have to deal
 
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
with you know you're going to have to
 
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
accept that there's going to be you know
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
some and nothing is precise I mean we'd
 
00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
have to go to every single school look
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
at every single expenditure every single
 
00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
student to really get some kind of
 
00:47:01.069 --> 00:47:01.079 align:start position:0%
precise things so that's just my comment
 
00:47:01.079 --> 00:47:05.870 align:start position:0%
precise things so that's just my comment
on

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
that if I stop talking for a while it's
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
because I have an issue with my throat
 
00:47:14.109 --> 00:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
and representative spillsbury knows you
 
00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
don't want me to start coughing because
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
you know what that looks
 
00:47:21.069 --> 00:47:21.079 align:start position:0%
like is this using current data in in
 
00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:23.839 align:start position:0%
the 04 formula it's using the data
 
00:47:27.549 --> 00:47:27.559 align:start position:0%
that's in the adequacy that um is
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
districts are receiving right
 
00:47:34.109 --> 00:47:34.119 align:start position:0%
now so you're familiar with
 
00:47:39.069 --> 00:47:39.079 align:start position:0%
ADM the median household income and the
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
owner this is owner
 
00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.030 align:start position:0%
owner this is owner
occupied

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
occupied
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
home or from the Census there's one
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
difference in here between fy4 and now I
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
switched it it used to be it was family
 
00:47:58.510 --> 00:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
income and I'm using household instead
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
for a couple of reasons you know we were
 
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
talking about 20 years
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
ago and I think
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
that people who occupy a home are
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
different the composition is different
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
now I think we have a lot more um
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
unmarried people or unrelated people
 
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
living in a
 
00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
home compared to percentage wise
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
compared to what it was 20 years ago
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
also the advantage of
 
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
using uh household income instead of
 
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
family is household income involves
 
00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:42.190 align:start position:0%
family is household income involves
every

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
every
 
00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
occupied um residents whereas family is
 
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
a much smaller subpopulation of
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
that so here's the
 
00:48:56.589 --> 00:48:56.599 align:start position:0%
premise look at the you look at the
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
household income you've got the state
 
00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:02.079 align:start position:0%
average running across the top for
 
00:49:04.349 --> 00:49:04.359 align:start position:0%
individual town just like
 
00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
aworth you can see the income in column
 
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
B in column
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
C it says if they were to have an income
 
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
tax of 1 half of
 
00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:23.240 align:start position:0%
1% how much would they have to pay so
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
that's column
 
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:28.789 align:start position:0%
that's column
C

00:49:28.789 --> 00:49:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:28.799 --> 00:49:30.510 align:start position:0%
 
then

00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
um if that's if that's how much they
 
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
pay when you when you compare it to the
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
home value what tax rate would that be
 
00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
so for aworth if the tax rate was
 
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
$177 per
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
thousand they would pay
 
00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.430 align:start position:0%
thousand they would pay
384

00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
384
 
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
town then if we jump over to let's see
 
00:50:09.309 --> 00:50:09.319 align:start position:0%
so the next the next step you're not
 
00:50:11.829 --> 00:50:11.839 align:start position:0%
going to see a number for this but the
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
next step is apply that tax rate
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
$177 to the equalized
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
valuation and you raise a certain amount
 
00:50:23.309 --> 00:50:23.319 align:start position:0%
of money which is just not it's it's in
 
00:50:26.109 --> 00:50:26.119 align:start position:0%
the formula you just don't see it you
 
00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
take that and you divide it by the ADM
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
in column A and that tells you how much
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
revenue per student that town can raise
 
00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.549 align:start position:0%
revenue per student that town can raise
can

00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
raise and up at the top you see what the
 
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
is so you can see there's
 
00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
a big
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
difference when you look down that
 
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
column at how much much revenue per
 
00:51:01.789 --> 00:51:01.799 align:start position:0%
pupil and that can be affected by the
 
00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:05.720 align:start position:0%
the things that affect that are the
 
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
income of the
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
household what the what the average home
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
value is and the equal the equalized
 
00:51:18.109 --> 00:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
valuation and the number of students s
 
00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:19.480 align:start position:0%
stop right there and let's look at a
 
00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:20.839 align:start position:0%
particular town I'm looking at
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater okay you're you're up that
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
959 um
 
00:51:33.789 --> 00:51:33.799 align:start position:0%
now if you go down along the lake if
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
you're on the lake side of the road your
 
00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:37.240 align:start position:0%
property value is much higher than on
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
the other side of the road and the
 
00:51:41.789 --> 00:51:41.799 align:start position:0%
incomes though of people on the other
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
side of the road are a lot of folks that
 
00:51:45.069 --> 00:51:45.079 align:start position:0%
are just going up to Plymouth and
 
00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
working hourly
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
wages so I I would particularly because
 
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
well the ones that are around the lake a
 
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
lot of those are are probably not owner
 
00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
some are owner occupied but probably a
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
guess but they're not residents other
 
00:52:08.109 --> 00:52:08.119 align:start position:0%
words well would would wouldn't you
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
guess that I would I would
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
assume that's the case yeah but I don't
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
know I I I I don't live there
 
00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
so okay why don't you keep marching on
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
then oh okay well I mean that that's a
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
good example because the income is below
 
00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.510 align:start position:0%
good example because the income is below
average

00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
average
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
mhm the home
 
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:33.160 align:start position:0%
value it doesn't it looks like it's a
 
00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
little be below the well these these are
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
not averages these are medians so one of
 
00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
the things when you look at the home
 
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
values it's not going to be those houses
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
on the lake it's not going to be the
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
ones the trailer parks either this is in
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
the middle so it kind of you know takes
 
00:52:59.789 --> 00:52:59.799 align:start position:0%
that part part out of the out of the
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
equation through through step e but when
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
you get to to um G it does come into
 
00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.510 align:start position:0%
you get to to um G it does come into
play

00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
play
 
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
because um you're going to be applying
 
00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:18.440 align:start position:0%
it to based on the size of the Town
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
based on the fact they only have 84
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
students that's a lot of property value
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
so that's when it comes back into to
 
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
play and that's why even though their
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
incomes are not very high their property
 
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
value is a little below average it's
 
00:53:40.349 --> 00:53:40.359 align:start position:0%
probably a little on the high side for
 
00:53:43.789 --> 00:53:43.799 align:start position:0%
the area but the revenue they can ra
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
raise is way way high so they're not
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
going to get any of this
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
Aid so it's all it can be any of those
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
factors that kick
 
00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:57.710 align:start position:0%
factors that kick
in

00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:59.910 --> 00:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
so we've we've
 
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
determined through G what we've come up
 
00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:06.440 align:start position:0%
with is kind of like the capacity for
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
each of these towns so one thing
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
um I saw it in
 
00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
fy6 I don't know if we've seen it since
 
00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
then there have sometimes been a
 
00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
component of adequacy Aid that says this
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
is the part of money you have
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
so how are you going to distribute it
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
it's not like you know this much per
 
00:54:33.309 --> 00:54:33.319 align:start position:0%
student and you come out with X
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
it's look at your students and whatever
 
00:54:38.589 --> 00:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
factors but you only have so much to
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
distribute so that's how this was
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
developed I mean you can clearly you can
 
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
just use parts of this but it was set up
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
to only distribute a certain amount of
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
money and in fy4 it was only $10
 
00:54:59.789 --> 00:54:59.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
here so for the next step if you look at
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
H you take the state average revenue per
 
00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:10.839 align:start position:0%
pupil and you multiply it by
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
two the reason for doing that is the
 
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
number that that is shows in that column
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
is oh wait a minute just forget that
 
00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:29.720 align:start position:0%
part the reason that it's two is because
 
00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:31.960 align:start position:0%
if you didn't multiply it by two you
 
00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
would only deal with funding the
 
00:55:39.029 --> 00:55:39.039 align:start position:0%
everything that's below the median and
 
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
the premise for this is you might want
 
00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
to you know fund some that are you know
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
not the top 10% but you want might want
 
00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:50.200 align:start position:0%
to fund some that are above the
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
median so that's why it's multiplied by
 
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.910 align:start position:0%
median so that's why it's multiplied by
two

00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.670 align:start position:0%
two
so

00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
um the next thing it does is it uses a
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
adjustment factor which is over un under
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
I that's a
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
percentage so so when you multipli the
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
$4,400 and you're going to compare that
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
to the individual town so the first one
 
00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
4,400 um
 
00:56:38.799 --> 00:56:40.630 align:start position:0%
4,400 um
dollars

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
3,116 and um aworth is below that so
 
00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't get any aid but if that's
 
00:56:57.309 --> 00:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
all we did did then it would cost way
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
more than
 
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
$50,000 so to make to make it come down
 
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
to match how much money you have to
 
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
distribute that's where that adjustment
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
Factor comes in you multiply that
 
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:13.880 align:start position:0%
adjustment Factor by the state average
 
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
and by the town's um amount which is in
 
00:57:19.079 --> 00:57:22.750 align:start position:0%
and by the town's um amount which is in
column

00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:27.029 --> 00:57:27.039 align:start position:0%
G so what you get when you do that the
 
00:57:27.039 --> 00:57:28.470 align:start position:0%
G so what you get when you do that the
individual

00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:31.720 align:start position:0%
towns you get certain amounts per town
 
00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
and then you
 
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
subract the
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
state which
 
00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:42.559 align:start position:0%
is um the with the factor in it which is
 
00:57:44.349 --> 00:57:44.359 align:start position:0%
the five
 
00:57:48.109 --> 00:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
2,500 by the
 
00:57:51.789 --> 00:57:51.799 align:start position:0%
local amount so let's look at Allenstown
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
so Allenstown local amount is
 
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
2017 but when you multiply it by that
 
00:58:03.069 --> 00:58:03.079 align:start position:0%
6 and then subtract it from the state
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
average the difference is
 
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
309 I could I you know I could have
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
shown more steps but I just didn't do
 
00:58:10.829 --> 00:58:10.839 align:start position:0%
that because it wouldn't fit on the page
 
00:58:10.839 --> 00:58:14.549 align:start position:0%
that because it wouldn't fit on the page
very

00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
well and then you just take the
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
309 m
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
students so we're there huh we are the
 
00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:36.510 align:start position:0%
students so we're there huh we are the
last

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:58:38.829 --> 00:58:38.839 align:start position:0%
column is
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
just just an example of so you could see
 
00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
like if you were trying to distribute
 
00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
more money what it would be look like
 
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
but you can't use the numbers in the
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
state um across the top that uh 205 and
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
the would in the it would be different
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
but the result would be this what's
 
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:00.839 align:start position:0%
shown so any questions on on this
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:08.440 align:start position:0%
AES it's not not really on the formul if
 
00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:09.270 align:start position:0%
AES it's not not really on the formul if
there's

00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
text that explains the formula which I
 
00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
don't think we have actually i' like to
 
00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:17.720 align:start position:0%
get that and that's really my only
 
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
question I think this is interesting
 
00:59:22.349 --> 00:59:22.359 align:start position:0%
background information that we should
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
retain and hold but I don't think we
 
00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
need to if we can get representative
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
fellows here it only only
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
difference you know this says 10 10
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
million in here and also this had the
 
00:59:38.029 --> 00:59:38.039 align:start position:0%
medium family instead so I can that
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
would be great before the end I can run
 
00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
up and get copies of this thank you very
 
00:59:45.309 --> 00:59:45.319 align:start position:0%
much represent luno so thanks and and
 
00:59:48.349 --> 00:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
thanks Sly for um for um showing this I
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I understand that
 
00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
th this isn't a a complete um form this
 
00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
is this is a fiscal capacity yeah oh
 
01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yeah this is this like
 
01:00:02.589 --> 01:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
stands alone I mean you can put this
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
formula this is just put it like not
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
even inadequacy right it's it's a it's a
 
01:00:09.119 --> 01:00:10.789 align:start position:0%
even inadequacy right it's it's a it's a
supplemental

01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
supplemental
 
01:00:14.109 --> 01:00:14.119 align:start position:0%
disparity um but I think actually isn't
 
01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
part of what we have now inadequacy
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely yeah yeah so I
 
01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
just want to so I separate component
 
01:00:22.589 --> 01:00:22.599 align:start position:0%
yeah I didn't really want to call it the
 
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:25.640 align:start position:0%
formula so thank you so I mean it's got
 
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
some um mechanisms in here that could
 
01:00:31.109 --> 01:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
actually even be applied to something
 
01:00:35.069 --> 01:00:35.079 align:start position:0%
else you know the idea of like you know
 
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:36.559 align:start position:0%
if you if you only have a certain amount
 
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
of money to use most of the time what
 
01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
you see is it's just pro-rated you know
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
give everybody 90% or something like
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
that how this works with that um I don't
 
01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
I doesn't even have a name like a oh I
 
01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:53.720 align:start position:0%
think it's called adjustment or
 
01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
something the adjustment percent is
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
something that when you don't have
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
enough money to give
 
01:01:04.589 --> 01:01:04.599 align:start position:0%
everybody what they would be entitled to
 
01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
it reallocates the money to fewer of the
 
01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.670 align:start position:0%
it reallocates the money to fewer of the
qualifiers

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
qualifiers
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
with most of
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
the um uh ret the amount that's retained
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
is higher for the ones with the greatest
 
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.549 align:start position:0%
is higher for the ones with the greatest
need

01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:25.559 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:01:28.109 --> 01:01:28.119 align:start position:0%
so it's not just pro-rated you're take
 
01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
you taking back from the ones that had
 
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
the had the least amount of Aid like per
 
01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.750 align:start position:0%
the had the least amount of Aid like per
student

01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
and lower you know redistributing it you
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
know Distributing more to the the lower
 
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
ones M Mr chairman yes so it's going to
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
take me a bit of time to
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
absorb this going calm to calm and
 
01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.549 align:start position:0%
absorb this going calm to calm and
reading

01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
reading
 
01:01:55.710 --> 01:01:55.720 align:start position:0%
but fundamentally you're trying to find
 
01:01:59.630 --> 01:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
a way of determining capacity to pay by
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
taking into account both household
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
income and property value and merging
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:18.839 --> 01:02:23.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:48.799 --> 01:02:53.349 align:start position:0%
 
students

01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.359 --> 01:03:01.589 align:start position:0%
 
represent

01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.269 --> 01:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the equalized
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
values that are um available to us from
 
01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
Dr uh were were determined April 1
 
01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
2022 and that April 1
 
01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
2024 we will finally get values as of
 
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
April 1 2023 we're looking at April 1
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
2022 values right now is that correct um
 
01:03:31.269 --> 01:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
actually I wasn't 100% sure there
 
01:03:33.269 --> 01:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
whatever equalized
 
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
valuations are in the FY 24 adequacy
 
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
because they might be that's
 
01:03:44.589 --> 01:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
2022 which equalized evaluations are in
 
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
FY 24
 
01:03:50.829 --> 01:03:50.839 align:start position:0%
adequacy I think it might be 21 would be
 
01:03:52.269 --> 01:03:52.279 align:start position:0%
the 220
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
billion number now down 25 it's up to
 
01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
310 million number well no no which year
 
01:04:04.349 --> 01:04:04.359 align:start position:0%
of equal up to so I I think it's 21 but
 
01:04:13.069 --> 01:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:16.829 --> 01:04:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
you see folks from Ways and Means really
 
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
get into this stuff well yeah yeah both
 
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
of you were there I
 
01:04:28.349 --> 01:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
I actually keep forgetting to ask Mark
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
to please put the year on the column
 
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
total I can tell you how 25 works so
 
01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
basically well which year is which year
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
of equal valuation is 25 25 I'll tell
 
01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
you 25 Works 25 we have Let's see we
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
have the ms1 comes in in the fall of of
 
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:50.200 align:start position:0%
uh this is why yeah so ms1 came in the
 
01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
fall of 20
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
the no sorry fall 22 then it was
 
01:04:59.150 --> 01:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
equalized throughout the 8mon period so
 
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
that would have been the fall of 22 so
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.789 --> 01:05:09.799 align:start position:0%
25 so this is
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
21 because this is this is FY
 
01:05:17.029 --> 01:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
24 any more questions any more questions
 
01:05:19.589 --> 01:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay repr fellows um
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
and Jen's getting you the uh language um
 
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
could I ask at this point um we had a
 
01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
lot of questions about the lawsuit um
 
01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
with conal and we have the
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
superintendent here this morning and I
 
01:05:31.269 --> 01:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
just thought this would be a great
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity I know she's a busy lady and
 
01:05:36.109 --> 01:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
has a lot to do would it be okay if if
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
we were yeah but what we're going to do
 
01:05:39.789 --> 01:05:39.799 align:start position:0%
first we're going to get into those two
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
bills right now the one 10 million the
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
other with 27s that will we'll have a
 
01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:45.880 align:start position:0%
little bit of discussion on what we have
 
01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
in front of us and then we'll be able to
 
01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
have or uh give some impl we just ask if
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
she has a time to stay
 
01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
though are you well set with time I just
 
01:05:58.269 --> 01:05:58.279 align:start position:0%
I all right thank you
 
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
good okay what I'd like to do now is
 
01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
discuss um where we are in terms of the
 
01:06:10.109 --> 01:06:10.119 align:start position:0%
bill which we have before us which is
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the base cost be $10
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
million 10 10 $110,000 per pupil yeah 10
 
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
million would be a wonderful thing but
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
we don't have it we don't own oil wells
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
or gold mine
 
01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
so with that I'd like to First Look at
 
01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
the sheet that has the cross outs on it
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
this one right
 
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:35.480 align:start position:0%
here because what what what this sheet
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
does it looks at the the formula which
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
came out of
 
01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
2008 and how we arrived at base
 
01:06:52.349 --> 01:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
cost and you can see that there's uh
 
01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
the salary of
 
01:06:58.069 --> 01:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
$425 everybody should have that sheet
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
now which was delivered by uh Jennifer
 
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
4 this is the one that came around that
 
01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
we asked to have copies
 
01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:11.559 align:start position:0%
made and you can see uh that the on the
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
second page in it shows you what the
 
01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
42560 and you can go down the sheet and
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
see all the towns which are above that
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
and on the last page you can start
 
01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
seeing how they really di down um to you
 
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.789 align:start position:0%
 
31,725

01:07:48.789 --> 01:07:48.799 align:start position:0%
31,725
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
2560 and the way it was designed back in
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
those initial days in 2008 there was a
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
33% added on to it for benefits
 
01:08:00.549 --> 01:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
associated with that contract and so
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
then you see the total teacher would
 
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
$56,500 within the building is based
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
upon a 1 to 25 that's um basically how
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
the base cost has been derived ever
 
01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
since we've never messed with this part
 
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
of the formula at all um other than the
 
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
bottom line figure which would be your
 
01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:41.789 align:start position:0%
bottom line figure which would be your
Universal

01:08:41.789 --> 01:08:41.799 align:start position:0%
Universal
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
cost and so you can see how it is if
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
it's 1 to 25 for K through 12 then that
 
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:54.829 --> 01:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
$2,264 special specialy teachers those
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
teachers like our PE teachers music
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
teachers Librarians add on this other
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
20% they there's five categories there
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
you have five preps during the course of
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
AOL week and so was $453 was added
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
on and it would be added on if we were
 
01:09:17.550 --> 01:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
using the uh the new figure 42560 and
 
01:09:18.910 --> 01:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
you can see what happens on the other
 
01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
side the Slate there for grades 3
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
through 12 when you come back to the
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
bottom side after you add in all the
 
01:09:26.349 --> 01:09:26.359 align:start position:0%
different components which were
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
established as contributing to the base
 
01:09:34.030 --> 01:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
cost you can see that after you add in
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
the individuals custodians instructional
 
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
materials technology etc for K through
 
01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
two it was 4,000 would be
 
01:09:48.749 --> 01:09:48.759 align:start position:0%
$4,690 for grades 3 through 12 $
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
4,245 and you can see how the formula
 
01:09:52.829 --> 01:09:52.839 align:start position:0%
comes up with a universal cost down
 
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
before how you get that Blended cost you
 
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
take the
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
4,698 for those three grade levels
 
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
multiply that by
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
three do the same thing for the 42 45
 
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
for the grades 4 through 10 you get to
 
01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
42 45 multiply for to 12 and multiply
 
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
that by 10 because there's 10 grades
 
01:10:17.149 --> 01:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
then divide that by the 13 total grades
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
and you came out this out was designed
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
you came out with 4,400 you would come
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
out with
 
01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.510 align:start position:0%
out with
4,454

01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
4,454
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
I believe back in the days in 2008 it
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
was a little over
 
01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
$3,400 so that that's uh that sheet
 
01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
right there there's
 
01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
um and we use that
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
sheet uh in if we're looking at the
 
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
other component of
 
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
$27,000 per pupil the base cost uh would
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
be um based upon the categories which we
 
01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
had and that's also attached if you went
 
01:10:58.270 --> 01:10:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
down in that lower
 
01:11:10.510 --> 01:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
table the lower
 
01:11:13.229 --> 01:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
table you can see the total number of
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
students we'd have if we use weighted
 
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
formulas for the three categories a b
 
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
and c this is the same legislation that
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
came out education policy last year but
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
using the a different weighted amount of
 
01:11:30.669 --> 01:11:30.679 align:start position:0%
the base cost to determine the amount of
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
money for the various categories for
 
01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
example if you go to the top level there
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
you can see in the top table category a
 
01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
has A6 of the base
 
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
cost and it shows the number of kids
 
01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:47.080 align:start position:0%
that were in that according to what was
 
01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
developed by the director of special
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
education and they have different
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
numbers than are in the the adequacy
 
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
formula the adequacy formula has a total
 
01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.149 align:start position:0%
formula the adequacy formula has a total
of

01:11:59.149 --> 01:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
3,965 kids this is 28,6 126 they take a
 
01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
one time in history to get their kids
 
01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
one time the other cost the state uses
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
for adequat an average cost and so they
 
01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
take a higher number of kids they have a
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
number of kids so um this formula has
 
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
been based off the bottom table the
 
01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
total number of kids we have in special
 
01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.470 align:start position:0%
total number of kids we have in special
education

01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:12:26.629 --> 01:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
3,965 if you took the amounts that we
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
have in category b a b and c the the
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
percentage the the percentage of the
 
01:12:38.669 --> 01:12:38.679 align:start position:0%
base a0 6 a 1.2 or a 1.8 you can see
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
that here's where we would get the the
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
at I I'm in this no I'm looking at this
 
01:12:57.149 --> 01:12:57.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:59.229 --> 01:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
looking right up on that top sheet right
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
mine you got different data it's.
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
five9 which
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
talking there there were there are two
 
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
sheets that we
 
01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:39.790 align:start position:0%
sheets that we
had

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
and yeah that that that sheet that one
 
01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
one you're looking at is one which was
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
developed for uh if we had a ratio of 1
 
01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.270 align:start position:0%
developed for uh if we had a ratio of 1
to

01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
23 and a 1 to 28 this is the formula
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
based upon the pupil teacher ratio for
 
01:13:59.149 --> 01:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
those grades of one 1 to 25
 
01:13:59.159 --> 01:14:01.430 align:start position:0%
those grades of one 1 to 25
and

01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay so we're
 
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
on it
 
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
the the the formula which had $
 
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
4,44 as a base cost has higher um uh
 
01:14:19.629 --> 01:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
percentages for determining special
 
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
education then does the other sheet your
 
01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
of course a larger amount on the base
 
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
cost in the other sheet when you're
 
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
talking about 1 to
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
23 Universal cost for that was
 
01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
$4,500 this is $4,400 we working off of
 
01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
so the base cost or excuse me the the
 
01:14:46.629 --> 01:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
amount of money allocated for those
 
01:14:48.189 --> 01:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
categories you could see how it is is
 
01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
broken out by the the same ratio that
 
01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
Rebecca fet did up a top when she had
 
01:14:57.629 --> 01:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
28,6 26 students this is
 
01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
3,965 we took the kind of same ratio and
 
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
project that in category C for example
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
in separate schools uh or in category C
 
01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
for the the homebound the residential
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
and the separate schools that came up
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
with a lower number of Kids U than does
 
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
the one down
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
below yeah so how did how did you come
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:29.790 --> 01:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
looked at a lot of other states and
 
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
there are other states have SIM similar
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
type rate but we're also a hybrid that
 
01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
in fact we have a separate category for
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
paying special Aid called catastrophic
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
Aid or special education Aid some of the
 
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
other states include that right right
 
01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
within adequacy so special
 
01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
categor it's aart from this formula
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
we're looking at so so I guess one of
 
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
the questions had the last we met last
 
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
we was in these three categories what is
 
01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:06.550 align:start position:0%
we was in these three categories what is
our

01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
Statewide yeah
 
01:16:12.990 --> 01:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
right our Statewide actual cost to uh to
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
provide special education services for
 
01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
all of the students Statewide are in and
 
01:16:25.229 --> 01:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
and then do these $66 million no no no66
 
01:16:25.239 --> 01:16:26.870 align:start position:0%
and then do these $66 million no no no66
million

01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
is what we have in the current Formula
 
01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
no no right that's a funding that's not
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's not the cost of the
 
01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
district that's the that's the funding
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
but you got to add in if you're looking
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
at the other component that comes the
 
01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
state is saying we're going to give
 
01:16:46.629 --> 01:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
districts 66 million the districts are
 
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
thats making up the number a billion
 
01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
dollar of cost and what is that what is
 
01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
that all in District cost State plus
 
01:17:00.159 --> 01:17:02.950 align:start position:0%
that all in District cost State plus
local

01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:07.149 --> 01:17:07.159 align:start position:0%
noal I'm not talk funds talking what
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
theost are the districts to provide
 
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
special education services to all
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
160,000 students across whatever
 
01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
number of those students fall into
 
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
categories a b and c that
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
Statewide cost all
 
01:17:36.510 --> 01:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
yes yeah we had that so if we're looking
 
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
at that 900 million then in the in the
 
01:17:45.550 --> 01:17:45.560 align:start position:0%
in the one that we were just talking
 
01:17:50.629 --> 01:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
about6 to 1.2 1.8 the the the total
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
funding by category comes out
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
district putting in a context like that
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of downshifting coming
 
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
from the federal government too which
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
and we're asking the local to pick up
 
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
that burden and the state yeah yeah
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
which is a huge burden the the the money
 
01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
we get from the federal government is
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
right it's under 20% now is it yeah 50
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
million so yeah yeah yeah terms of Rel
 
01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
from the state I'm just trying to put it
 
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
in the Contex of what what our local
 
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
school districts are are spending so
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
local school dist spending $900 million
 
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
on all the students in a plus b plus C
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
and we
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
I'm this
 
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet says State might put 93
 
01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
million towards that and there you know
 
01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
yeah this this formula basically says
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to increase the amount of
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
money we're putting underneath special
 
01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
education differentiated by about $35
 
01:19:03.149 --> 01:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
million and then if you add the base
 
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
cost which this would also jump to
 
01:19:11.629 --> 01:19:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
another go that next sheet I can get it
 
01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.149 align:start position:0%
another go that next sheet I can get it
that's

01:19:19.149 --> 01:19:19.159 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
yeah if
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
you if you
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
if you take what we're spending
 
01:19:33.070 --> 01:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
for FY 25 for the base cost we are
 
01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:34.550 align:start position:0%
for FY 25 for the base cost we are
spending

01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
spending
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
presently uh
 
01:19:37.679 --> 01:19:39.390 align:start position:0%
presently uh
646

01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
646
 
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
million and with raising it that's at
 
01:19:43.629 --> 01:19:43.639 align:start position:0%
four $
 
01:19:45.629 --> 01:19:45.639 align:start position:0%
4,182 per
 
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
kid and then if we increase to 4,400
 
01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.229 align:start position:0%
kid and then if we increase to 4,400
roughly

01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
01:19:53.950 --> 01:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
$444 it goes 680 so the difference there
 
01:19:57.550 --> 01:19:57.560 align:start position:0%
is the $34,000 for the base cost the
 
01:19:59.629 --> 01:19:59.639 align:start position:0%
base cost difference and the
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid cost will be increase
 
01:20:05.629 --> 01:20:05.639 align:start position:0%
of 35 so this is projecting that to
 
01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
increase both the from the the the bill
 
01:20:12.189 --> 01:20:12.199 align:start position:0%
that's the 10,000 per child in the 27
 
01:20:15.390 --> 01:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
we'd be increasing the uh
 
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
additional Revenue needed to the formula
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
of $69
 
01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:23.390 align:start position:0%
of $69
million

01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
so that's therefore for discussion
 
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
purposes and that I I guess where we are
 
01:20:31.390 --> 01:20:31.400 align:start position:0%
right now is that let's look at these
 
01:20:34.350 --> 01:20:34.360 align:start position:0%
two bills which we have the 10 million
 
01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
and the 27
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
million and and in conjunction with the
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
bill that you're putting forth represent
 
01:20:44.350 --> 01:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
Ames and
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
yourself we've seen that that needs
 
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
interim study and there there there's
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
lots to do on that I I concur so we're
 
01:20:56.350 --> 01:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
not ready to go there my concerns are
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
here we are going into
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
this next year when policy statements
 
01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
are going to have to be sent out in
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
building a budget and we're not going to
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
have anything the foundation formula is
 
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
not going to be there yet because that's
 
01:21:12.510 --> 01:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
going to be legislation submitted in the
 
01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
next year that year so we could be
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
kicking the can down here and I'm not
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
interested in kicking the can down the
 
01:21:21.070 --> 01:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
road I'd like to see some changes occur
 
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
one to reflect the actual cost of a
 
01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:24.590 align:start position:0%
one to reflect the actual cost of a
starting

01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
starting
 
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
teacher and to put in the in the formula
 
01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
some weighted categories to support the
 
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
need for recognizing that it costs a
 
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
whole lot more Now speech therapists may
 
01:21:39.550 --> 01:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
have 70 to 75 kids on their case load
 
01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
that's pretty typical now throughout the
 
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
country and and the the case loads we
 
01:21:47.629 --> 01:21:47.639 align:start position:0%
know might be a lot smaller for a a
 
01:21:50.350 --> 01:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
student that is really handicapped in
 
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
needing lot of special care that's why
 
01:21:54.430 --> 01:21:54.440 align:start position:0%
you see the C category B you know have
 
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
more allocated in the weight for funding
 
01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
in differentiated Aid and C definitely
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
category C which yes it's not going to
 
01:22:04.750 --> 01:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
get you that that three and a half times
 
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
and then the 20% on top that's
 
01:22:08.229 --> 01:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
catastrophic aid but it's going to get
 
01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
you closer to not having to raise as
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
much locally to meet those needs I
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
cannot see us jumping right into
 
01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
something that's going to wholeheartedly
 
01:22:22.030 --> 01:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
fund all this stuff in the next year and
 
01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
so that's what I'm trying to do is
 
01:22:25.870 --> 01:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
figure out is there a step we can move
 
01:22:29.070 --> 01:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
forward to try to do something which is
 
01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
based upon realistic figures you know
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
the the base cost would be built on the
 
01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
minimum wage for a person starting out
 
01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
in education and it's based upon these
 
01:22:42.430 --> 01:22:42.440 align:start position:0%
contracts which we've seen right here
 
01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
secondly on the weighted we need to wait
 
01:22:46.709 --> 01:22:46.719 align:start position:0%
out I firmly believe that we need a
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
policy this will actually when we're
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
coming down later on to be discussing
 
01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.229 align:start position:0%
coming down later on to be discussing
the

01:22:53.229 --> 01:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
program that's came out of the
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
commission they also recommended some
 
01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
weight as they did for a lot of other
 
01:23:07.709 --> 01:23:07.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
education what so what you're what
 
01:23:13.950 --> 01:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
you're talking about Mr chair are are
 
01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:31.470 --> 01:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
the I
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
hases that that special
 
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
education special education
 
01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
differentiated a would
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
the top part there table is based upon
 
01:23:59.669 --> 01:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
not the number of kids which are
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
reflected we got to base on the bottom
 
01:24:02.159 --> 01:24:03.790 align:start position:0%
reflected we got to base on the bottom
one

01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:11.790 --> 01:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
yeah then
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
next with theas going up 4182
 
01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
444 it would have a net increase of base
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:29.390 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
yes per
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
year so the by enemy would double it y
 
01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:49.400 align:start position:0%
yep yep yeah that's exactly what this is
 
01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
doing it's trying to
 
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
move the dial a little bit I recognize
 
01:24:57.310 --> 01:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
this is not going to be funding
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
everything the way people really see the
 
01:25:01.109 --> 01:25:01.119 align:start position:0%
need and and have the need in these
 
01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
towns because they're having the raise
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
money still but this is moving the dial
 
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
and I think it's more realistic in terms
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
of really capturing those those dollars
 
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
in any kind of a a formula we have
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:19.350 align:start position:0%
 
us

01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.629 --> 01:25:21.639 align:start position:0%
yes I think that's a good direction to
 
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
go that's the first thing I want to say
 
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
to try to get something incre
 
01:25:28.669 --> 01:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
incremental out the door so that there's
 
01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:30.639 align:start position:0%
some immediate relief and that's what I
 
01:25:34.189 --> 01:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
think you're pointing towards um the
 
01:25:36.109 --> 01:25:36.119 align:start position:0%
what we're basing it on I think we all
 
01:25:39.790 --> 01:25:39.800 align:start position:0%
should recognize is not is only a a
 
01:25:44.189 --> 01:25:44.199 align:start position:0%
portion of real costs and um uh a good
 
01:25:47.070 --> 01:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
illustration of that to my way of
 
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
thinking is that we're building off of
 
01:25:52.510 --> 01:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
the minimum salary for the starting
 
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
teacher and in fact schools have a range
 
01:25:58.470 --> 01:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
of teachers who've been there for long
 
01:26:00.629 --> 01:26:00.639 align:start position:0%
periods of time so the average teacher
 
01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
cost is significantly higher than that
 
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
um and so forth um so let's not pretend
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
it's other than that that to just react
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
to that or not react to it but that's
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
the way it was done and that was the
 
01:26:17.950 --> 01:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
same question that came up back in the
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
days that the 08 was put together
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and so there's been
 
01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
questions well should we pay taking on
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
the five-year teacher the three-year
 
01:26:29.950 --> 01:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
teacher the and yeah that's always been
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
there but this is uh are some figures
 
01:26:35.629 --> 01:26:35.639 align:start position:0%
that can be captured I'm not saying I'm
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
drilling down and saying this is the way
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
it should be but we need to base it upon
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
what is actually a a data point that is
 
01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
realistic that's happening and this this
 
01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
figure is based
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
upon data that we can justify it could
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
be could be
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
so I I I buy in to trying to work it
 
01:26:58.270 --> 01:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
that way but I also want to
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
say uh that there is that that uh larger
 
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
context that's largely reality that
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
we'll hear from the superintendent on
 
01:27:11.629 --> 01:27:11.639 align:start position:0%
perhaps um but the way that we need to
 
01:27:13.550 --> 01:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
address that because it's really
 
01:27:15.790 --> 01:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
complicated and uh there hasn't been
 
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
time in the last two weeks to do much of
 
01:27:20.109 --> 01:27:20.119 align:start position:0%
anything other than shuffle through the
 
01:27:23.189 --> 01:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
bills that have been assigned to us um
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
is to put the the 1586 as you've
 
01:27:31.629 --> 01:27:31.639 align:start position:0%
suggested we will do into interim study
 
01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:33.800 align:start position:0%
uh as well as I think the special ed
 
01:27:37.870 --> 01:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
Reform Bill 1686 I don't know how these
 
01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
numbers came out that way but uh anyway
 
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
um see both into interim study with the
 
01:27:48.030 --> 01:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
idea that this will be a a serious
 
01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
interim study and if I if I was a able
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
to make it happen I would I would uh
 
01:27:59.109 --> 01:27:59.119 align:start position:0%
renew with the speaker's help um this
 
01:28:04.669 --> 01:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittee as a way of uh boring in on
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
the what we have before us and the
 
01:28:09.870 --> 01:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity that it presents and make
 
01:28:12.149 --> 01:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
the best of it which may mean we come
 
01:28:16.669 --> 01:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
out of uh out of that process with not
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
just one not just one single this is the
 
01:28:21.870 --> 01:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
the way to go but a couple of or maybe
 
01:28:25.870 --> 01:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
more more than a couple of ways to go we
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
have a limited pool of dollars that it's
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
not infinite and and when it comes to
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
Dollars allocated towards education yes
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
we have the money in the education trust
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
fund but but that's limited too and and
 
01:28:44.669 --> 01:28:44.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:48.910 --> 01:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
that when we're discussing these figures
 
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
right now my mind's sort of going blank
 
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's the I I I'll come back I just lost
 
01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
all my track I don't know how your mind
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
still works after what you've been
 
01:29:06.189 --> 01:29:06.199 align:start position:0%
through for the last two weeksy
 
01:29:10.030 --> 01:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
yeah it'll come to me yeah yeah so um so
 
01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
we've got we've got two bills that could
 
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
be amended that would that would go
 
01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
towards what you're what you're
 
01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:22.280 align:start position:0%
proposing here with a um increas ining
 
01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:23.400 align:start position:0%
the base to
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
4404 and then uh and then splitting out
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
the three categories for special
 
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
education differentiated Aid and the
 
01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639 align:start position:0%
total cost of that proposal would be
 
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
approximately $70 million correct okay
 
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
so so that's that's this right here and
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
what you what you handed out earlier
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
which I think Mr landeron had prepared
 
01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
for finance yesterday shows
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
approximately $222 million estimated to
 
01:29:58.590 --> 01:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
be um um I'm sorry at the end of this
 
01:30:03.109 --> 01:30:03.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal year uh uh school year 2024 $182
 
01:30:06.109 --> 01:30:06.119 align:start position:0%
million to be U remaining in the
 
01:30:09.550 --> 01:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so you're about $70
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
million into that so my my concern and I
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
I lost track of us is back now when you
 
01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
add more money into the
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
base we're not really putting
 
01:30:25.109 --> 01:30:25.119 align:start position:0%
dollars on the right hand side of the
 
01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
formula so I'm really hesitant of
 
01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:31.400 align:start position:0%
jumping the base up to
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%
6,000 5,000 or wherever we got to go
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
without a trying to D now when the two
 
01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
categories we're affecting every
 
01:30:40.510 --> 01:30:40.520 align:start position:0%
Community is going to be impacted
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
similarly with what these two things are
 
01:30:45.149 --> 01:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
doing because that's they're all part of
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
adequacy differentiated Aid and that
 
01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
it's not touching the other side of the
 
01:30:51.390 --> 01:30:51.400 align:start position:0%
formula which needs to be addressed if
 
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
we're using the old formula Mr chair
 
01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
we've done a lot of school funding stuff
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
together and I I know you know I'm with
 
01:30:59.229 --> 01:30:59.239 align:start position:0%
you and I know you're with me on this
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
one so that I'm really hesitant of
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
jumping up that base because it's going
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
to be sending a lot of dollars out to
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
people that are
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
already keeping excess yeah but I think
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
what could be what I think what could be
 
01:31:15.629 --> 01:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
very interesting though is if if we
 
01:31:18.109 --> 01:31:18.119 align:start position:0%
looked at something like what you're
 
01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
proposing here with about a $70 million
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
cost of of ba of base plus special
 
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
education categories and then something
 
01:31:29.310 --> 01:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
like what representative fellows has
 
01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
presented which I think is was just a
 
01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
really a model and and could be you know
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
tightened up by the by the department
 
01:31:40.270 --> 01:31:40.280 align:start position:0%
and and and Sally's got examples of a
 
01:31:43.229 --> 01:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
essentially a a $50 million right-and
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
Side Package you know Aid package and
 
01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:46.750 align:start position:0%
Side Package you know Aid package and
aund

01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
aund
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
million um you know package maybe
 
01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
something between those two numbers that
 
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
comes in safely under what what Mr L
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
what the legislative budg budget
 
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
assistant is is estimating that might be
 
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
something that's within our our our
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
means is doable and moves the needle in
 
01:32:13.470 --> 01:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
both the direction that that that the
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
court has suggested and or the court has
 
01:32:20.030 --> 01:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
said has has ordered and um and
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
something that provides some Equity um
 
01:32:24.990 --> 01:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
to our districts as well and property
 
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.149 align:start position:0%
to our districts as well and property
tax

01:32:27.149 --> 01:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
relief I I understand what you're
 
01:32:31.229 --> 01:32:31.239 align:start position:0%
talking so you're you were talking about
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere putting another 70 million in
 
01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
on top of this figure
 
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
and I just don't want to send something
 
01:32:41.149 --> 01:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
on that's going to be dead upon arrival
 
01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
but I'm saying you do it doing it doing
 
01:32:46.109 --> 01:32:46.119 align:start position:0%
it through a through a fiscal capacity
 
01:32:48.990 --> 01:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
disparity package not through a left-and
 
01:32:50.669 --> 01:32:50.679 align:start position:0%
side package but through a right-and
 
01:32:53.149 --> 01:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
side package making sure that it doesn't
 
01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
eat into hold harmless and stuff like
 
01:32:59.390 --> 01:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
that so that we're not penalizing it or
 
01:33:02.990 --> 01:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
we're not I don't say penalizing that
 
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
where where it where it's where it's not
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
doing things where where it where it's
 
01:33:10.830 --> 01:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
intended to to help and and I and I and
 
01:33:13.229 --> 01:33:13.239 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm really getting at is do
 
01:33:16.590 --> 01:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
we have a a a bill yeah that could be
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
amended to do something like this or are
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
we out of
 
01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:23.950 align:start position:0%
we out of
luck

01:33:23.950 --> 01:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
we have one other one another swep in
 
01:33:27.390 --> 01:33:27.400 align:start position:0%
the committee but that's we're out of
 
01:33:29.790 --> 01:33:29.800 align:start position:0%
luck on that one I me we have a swep
 
01:33:33.629 --> 01:33:33.639 align:start position:0%
here we also have yours um but that we
 
01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
have the one that's the 10 and the 27
 
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
which deals
 
01:33:41.790 --> 01:33:41.800 align:start position:0%
specifically with those areas of of
 
01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
adequacy we're now sliding and the
 
01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
committee's been tasked if you go back
 
01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
and read the report that was put out by
 
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think I front of me right now
 
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
the by the speaker's office in
 
01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the minority leaders
 
01:33:57.310 --> 01:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
office we were to look at the formula
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
and recommended changes that can best
 
01:34:02.510 --> 01:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
support where we need to go so somehow
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
it probably could be done uh we could
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
have a n a non gerine Umar it well or or
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
you could even use say that it's part of
 
01:34:16.709 --> 01:34:16.719 align:start position:0%
the overall how we fund education yeah
 
01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
we could use one of those bills to
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
address both base and differentiated a
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
sped use one of those bills to do the
 
01:34:29.470 --> 01:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
other side of the formula
 
01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
okay I would think that that would be
 
01:34:33.310 --> 01:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
Germaine too I'm not the one that makes
 
01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
that decision but we'd want to have a
 
01:34:38.510 --> 01:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
hearing anyway certainly yeah yeah
 
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
because I don't me want to mess around
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
with the the one that's coming from
 
01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
ardinger and you and you well it's from
 
01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
from from and it comes out the
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
commission yeah I understand that and I
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
the SWAT bill
 
01:34:57.990 --> 01:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
um that that that's that's not going to
 
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
go down party lines at all it's going to
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
go down Community lines and that's
 
01:35:03.790 --> 01:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
that's a good way of killing something
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
too but you know we'll have to deal with
 
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
that one separately I I don't want to
 
01:35:08.709 --> 01:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
mess with that right looking at looking
 
01:35:10.629 --> 01:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
at these right here these bills have to
 
01:35:14.109 --> 01:35:14.119 align:start position:0%
be out of committee February 14th we
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
will be acting on these bills on
 
01:35:18.109 --> 01:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
February the 13th they have to be out of
 
01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
committee on the 15th report reported by
 
01:35:22.229 --> 01:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
the 15th
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
um so so if we're going to if we're
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
going to do anything with with with
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
amendments that needs to be done ASAP so
 
01:35:34.270 --> 01:35:34.280 align:start position:0%
that we exactly right get see this has
 
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
to go back to the policy committee and
 
01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to you know make
 
01:35:40.750 --> 01:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations there for them to move
 
01:35:42.430 --> 01:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
forward so
 
01:35:45.070 --> 01:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah we're running out of time and we
 
01:35:46.990 --> 01:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
also have the SWAT bill that deals with
 
01:35:49.590 --> 01:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
gambling which is always a
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
tool um right but that's all that's
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
separate I'm just but that's the only
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
only fun other funding bill that I'm
 
01:35:58.430 --> 01:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
recognizing we're in possession of yeah
 
01:36:01.629 --> 01:36:01.639 align:start position:0%
okay we he yes we can do that now but
 
01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
we're I wanted to hone in on this
 
01:36:06.510 --> 01:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
discussion right here uh so
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
that we I'm I'm trying to get some sort
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
of idea where we're going and so that
 
01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
the six people that are going to have to
 
01:36:15.790 --> 01:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
make the final vote
 
01:36:18.990 --> 01:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
here can do it and I don't know if it's
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
you know for you know if we have
 
01:36:22.750 --> 01:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
accomplished what we need to accomplish
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
here I think I'd like to see us make
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
some kind of recommendation that special
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
ed differentiate be
 
01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:37.790 align:start position:0%
ed differentiate be
weighted

01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:40.990 --> 01:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
period Well you know I I I think what we
 
01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
need to do is conceptually we need to
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
say we believe that weighted formula is
 
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
very very important if you leave the
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
numbers out of it um I I think we'll get
 
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
unanimous consent throughout the policy
 
01:36:59.910 --> 01:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
committee and it'll go on to finance uh
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
numbers can be put in it by us as well
 
01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
but uh the commission recommended it um
 
01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
and Most states do it and the base cost
 
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
I I think a recommendation needs if
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
we're we're working on the current
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
Formula we need to recommend that we we
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
allocate dollars with
 
01:37:24.750 --> 01:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
in through that basee formula we have
 
01:37:27.390 --> 01:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
here that are matched up what the cost
 
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
of an educator is today a teacher and it
 
01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
sort of does that for the beginning year
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't do it all the way but the
 
01:37:37.070 --> 01:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
concept is moving that ball closer right
 
01:37:39.430 --> 01:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
now we're funding at what 4186 something
 
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
like that that's below the 4,400 which
 
01:37:44.589 --> 01:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
is up to what we're seeing as the
 
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
average we're F funding absolutely the
 
01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:48.149 align:start position:0%
average we're F funding absolutely the
minimal

01:37:48.149 --> 01:37:48.159 align:start position:0%
minimal
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
level of of of those that are paying 30
 
01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
plus thousand per teacher starting well
 
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
I mean yeah yeah I mean I think there's
 
01:37:58.669 --> 01:37:58.679 align:start position:0%
a there's a there's a lot to I mean if
 
01:38:00.189 --> 01:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
we want to pick apart the sheet there's
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
a lot to pick apart on this but but I
 
01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
but I but I agree with you
 
01:38:06.910 --> 01:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
representative lad that that sticking
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
with what we could do is is a lot more
 
01:38:13.229 --> 01:38:13.239 align:start position:0%
the funding commission or study that
 
01:38:16.589 --> 01:38:16.599 align:start position:0%
we're looking at needs to really look at
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
inputs vers the other but also we need
 
01:38:21.629 --> 01:38:21.639 align:start position:0%
to look at even if we are going to to if
 
01:38:23.589 --> 01:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
we by chance stay with something like
 
01:38:26.510 --> 01:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
this this is the other areas within this
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
may not be reflective of what it's like
 
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:30.990 align:start position:0%
may not be reflective of what it's like
in

01:38:30.990 --> 01:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:38:34.830 --> 01:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
2025 vers 2008 well I mean just the
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
benefits alone health insurance
 
01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
retirement workers comp professional
 
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
development grad courses you know well
 
01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
even when you're looking at okay where
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
where's the AI guy in there or you know
 
01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:47.109 align:start position:0%
where's the AI guy in there or you know
yeah

01:38:47.109 --> 01:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:38:50.229 --> 01:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
CIS the cost of doing technical stuff in
 
01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
schools now a whole a lot more than it
 
01:38:54.149 --> 01:38:54.159 align:start position:0%
was there but there's other needs too
 
01:38:58.030 --> 01:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
that folks have mentioned to us that
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
aren't included in those inputs yeah
 
01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
that we need to discuss as well same
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
real student teach student teacher
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
ratios too there's there's a lot of
 
01:39:09.870 --> 01:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
stuff yeah but and so we'll never get
 
01:39:12.589 --> 01:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
out of it if we right now that we don't
 
01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
have time to do it right now that's
 
01:39:17.709 --> 01:39:17.719 align:start position:0%
right so so my next question are um
 
01:39:20.589 --> 01:39:20.599 align:start position:0%
what's what's our and I think it goes to
 
01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
what Mel was asking what what do we need
 
01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:24.550 align:start position:0%
what Mel was asking what what do we need
to

01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
what when is this committee going to
 
01:39:28.589 --> 01:39:28.599 align:start position:0%
meet so that we can finish up our
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
immediate tasks leading to the February
 
01:39:34.430 --> 01:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
15th got to be out of committee um and
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
then what's our what's the plan going
 
01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
Beyond I asked a question what are we
 
01:39:42.430 --> 01:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
going to do at another meeting this
 
01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:45.719 align:start position:0%
group right here look at look at amended
 
01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
language so next next week we'll get in
 
01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure I'm keeping up
 
01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:53.510 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure I'm keeping up
with

01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:39:56.910 --> 01:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
you um it's my impression that what
 
01:39:59.470 --> 01:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting is that 1583 be
 
01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:06.189 --> 01:40:06.199 align:start position:0%
444 and that HP
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
1656 on the special ed be amended with
 
01:40:11.229 --> 01:40:11.239 align:start position:0%
the three different categories each at
 
01:40:15.229 --> 01:40:15.239 align:start position:0%
the uh figures that you have here 2642
 
01:40:17.709 --> 01:40:17.719 align:start position:0%
that was one suggestion one another
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
suggestion is to
 
01:40:22.030 --> 01:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
add both those TX pass on one of those
 
01:40:25.229 --> 01:40:25.239 align:start position:0%
bills okay so variation on the theme but
 
01:40:29.470 --> 01:40:29.480 align:start position:0%
but the point is to enact those two
 
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
propositions in one or two bills this
 
01:40:35.550 --> 01:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
session to take effect with the next
 
01:40:38.950 --> 01:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
banial budget commencing July 1st 25
 
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
giving direction that's where you're try
 
01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
to finance to know this is what policy
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
is stating that we'd like to see
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
included in the next buying in budget
 
01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
okay so so so the the cost of which
 
01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
which would be an incremental $770
 
01:40:54.159 --> 01:40:55.669 align:start position:0%
which would be an incremental $770
million

01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:40:58.669 --> 01:40:58.679 align:start position:0%
which I think sounds
 
01:41:01.149 --> 01:41:01.159 align:start position:0%
manageable it wouldn't be for
 
01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
fy2 yeah that's not the next bium budget
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's excuse
 
01:41:10.830 --> 01:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
me FY exactly yeah so FY 26 but taking
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
effect July 1st 25 no taking effect July
 
01:41:14.159 --> 01:41:15.189 align:start position:0%
effect July 1st 25 no taking effect July
1st

01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
1st
 
01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
2024 well it's my understanding that
 
01:41:21.390 --> 01:41:21.400 align:start position:0%
this is to take effect next year and
 
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
drafted and I think that implementing it
 
01:41:32.310 --> 01:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
starting the next budget then you can
 
01:41:36.109 --> 01:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
manage for your revenues and and so on
 
01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
on what I had in here
 
01:41:44.430 --> 01:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
2025 yeah I thought you were talking
 
01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
about about taking effect for fy2 which
 
01:41:53.589 --> 01:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
be July 1st
 
01:41:56.589 --> 01:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
2024 no it it would take effect July 1
 
01:41:58.629 --> 01:41:58.639 align:start position:0%
2023 because we've already established a
 
01:42:01.229 --> 01:42:01.239 align:start position:0%
bud budget for
 
01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
fy2 no yes yes we yes we have well we've
 
01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
established the budget and the and the
 
01:42:08.589 --> 01:42:08.599 align:start position:0%
preliminary you know estimates but but
 
01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
not the uh not the well the
 
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
preliminaries don't even yeah the
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
preliminaries are coming out the actuals
 
01:42:17.070 --> 01:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
won't come out until um till later this
 
01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
year so if if I can just I was trying to
 
01:42:20.239 --> 01:42:21.430 align:start position:0%
year so if if I can just I was trying to
establish

01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
establish
 
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh that it's my understanding we're
 
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
talking about having this take effect
 
01:42:28.669 --> 01:42:28.679 align:start position:0%
July 1st 25 so we commit to Something in
 
01:42:32.189 --> 01:42:32.199 align:start position:0%
24 that takes effect in 25 for the next
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
budget cycle so I just wanted to point
 
01:42:36.109 --> 01:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
out because I wasn't sure whether this
 
01:42:36.119 --> 01:42:37.510 align:start position:0%
out because I wasn't sure whether this
was

01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
clear the summary we have in front of us
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
on the education trust fund shows a
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
cumulative ending balance at the end of
 
01:42:51.709 --> 01:42:51.719 align:start position:0%
FY 23 of 161
 
01:42:53.950 --> 01:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
at the end of 24
 
01:42:58.149 --> 01:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
182 and at the end of 25 222 let's just
 
01:43:01.109 --> 01:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
remember that's cumulative so you tap
 
01:43:02.669 --> 01:43:02.679 align:start position:0%
into that you don't get to do it
 
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
recurringly year after year the
 
01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
increment that's being contributed to
 
01:43:11.229 --> 01:43:11.239 align:start position:0%
that accumulated balance is 20,
 
01:43:15.750 --> 01:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
705 for 24 and 39 right
 
01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:17.390 align:start position:0%
705 for 24 and 39 right
so

01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
70 and another 70 um is way outside the
 
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
realm of what our current Revenue
 
01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
structure would support 70 I think could
 
01:43:31.870 --> 01:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
be accommodated so so so just to no I
 
01:43:35.310 --> 01:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
think 70 plus 70 could be within it is
 
01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
within the revenue structure because
 
01:43:40.589 --> 01:43:40.599 align:start position:0%
we've got 182 million that is estimated
 
01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
to be um to be the remainder in the
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
education trust fund on can't tap it
 
01:43:48.350 --> 01:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
over and over no you can't tap it over
 
01:43:49.950 --> 01:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
and over but when we go into the next
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
budget cycle remember we're going to
 
01:43:52.750 --> 01:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
have a different legislature at that
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
point that that will also be able to
 
01:43:57.790 --> 01:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
consider the um you know what the what
 
01:44:00.750 --> 01:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
the you know how to fund the education
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
trust fund but can I just remind us all
 
01:44:04.990 --> 01:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
that we currently have a bill that will
 
01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
be going to the floor probably not this
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
week but next week that will drain the
 
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
education trust at the end of this
 
01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:17.910 align:start position:0%
education trust at the end of this
biennium

01:44:17.910 --> 01:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:23.310 --> 01:44:23.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I I just I I agree with this
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
understanding that the idea behind this
 
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
oneshot infusion of money directed
 
01:44:33.550 --> 01:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
according to these formulas to the
 
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities and um it will be
 
01:44:38.750 --> 01:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
fashioned and drafted in such a way that
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's what it is it's a one shot it's
 
01:44:41.669 --> 01:44:41.679 align:start position:0%
not a
 
01:44:43.990 --> 01:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
continuing um
 
01:44:46.709 --> 01:44:46.719 align:start position:0%
commitment and it would be taking effect
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
in uh uh for the next fiscal year
 
01:44:54.109 --> 01:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
so fiscal year 25 that's my understand
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
starting that's what we're trying to do
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
starting July 1st 2024 yeah yeah
 
01:44:59.679 --> 01:45:01.550 align:start position:0%
starting July 1st 2024 yeah yeah
yeah

01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:45:06.189 --> 01:45:06.199 align:start position:0%
yes well I I I can see what we're doing
 
01:45:09.510 --> 01:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
here uh my concern is the
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
lawsuit uh and
 
01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
um we talked about kicking the can down
 
01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:16.669 align:start position:0%
um we talked about kicking the can down
the

01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:16.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:19.589 --> 01:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
road and this is what we're proposing
 
01:45:22.669 --> 01:45:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps it's a realistic Band-Aid
 
01:45:30.870 --> 01:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
based upon our current fiscal uh
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
status but it doesn't deal I don't think
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
it deals with what the court suit
 
01:45:41.709 --> 01:45:41.719 align:start position:0%
said and um now granted 1586 is an
 
01:45:43.669 --> 01:45:43.679 align:start position:0%
attempt to try to deal this in a more
 
01:45:46.510 --> 01:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
Global thing and I can understand why it
 
01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
may be put into further study
 
01:45:52.350 --> 01:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
Etc but I think there's an immediate
 
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
there's more of an immediate need I mean
 
01:45:57.189 --> 01:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
that my that voice has to be in this
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
room and hasn't been in this room in
 
01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:01.350 align:start position:0%
room and hasn't been in this room in
this

01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:46:05.550 --> 01:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
conversation and so I think that's my
 
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
frustration I mean we
 
01:46:10.589 --> 01:46:10.599 align:start position:0%
created we created the
 
01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
commission not to go back there but we
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
created the commission to try to finally
 
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
have a look after 40 Years of the data
 
01:46:21.510 --> 01:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
that has been given to this to the
 
01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
department for years we looked a 10-year
 
01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
look first time in 40 years an outside
 
01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
group came in and looked at it and they
 
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
gave us some
 
01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
data now I know that that data is not
 
01:46:37.149 --> 01:46:37.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily reflected in the
 
01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
lawsuit but at some point in time we got
 
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
to deal with this
 
01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
folks I mean the commission was created
 
01:46:45.629 --> 01:46:45.639 align:start position:0%
because frankly the
 
01:46:48.669 --> 01:46:48.679 align:start position:0%
legislature has not done its task on
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
what the court has asked for
 
01:46:54.149 --> 01:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
has not done its task and we've tinkered
 
01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
it here we've tinkered it there little
 
01:46:58.709 --> 01:46:58.719 align:start position:0%
more money has gone out oh aren't we
 
01:47:01.229 --> 01:47:01.239 align:start position:0%
happy we just did a little more
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
money and so that's I guess that's my
 
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
frustration of trying to deal with the
 
01:47:08.669 --> 01:47:08.679 align:start position:0%
immediate issues
 
01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
here but the long-term thing is still
 
01:47:12.709 --> 01:47:12.719 align:start position:0%
sitting out
 
01:47:16.870 --> 01:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
there and and I'm sorry I that's that's
 
01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:18.109 align:start position:0%
there and and I'm sorry I that's that's
my

01:47:18.109 --> 01:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:47:21.910 --> 01:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
frustration Celli but the long term
 
01:47:23.950 --> 01:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
that's hanging out there we don't we
 
01:47:26.109 --> 01:47:26.119 align:start position:0%
don't know because what we have is an
 
01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
interim step from the courts there's
 
01:47:32.270 --> 01:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
there's more Court uh review and action
 
01:47:35.870 --> 01:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
down the road that's all pending too
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay I I really don't want to get into a
 
01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion of the courts because
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
our task is not you know I understand
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
that and we all understand that and
 
01:47:46.990 --> 01:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
think it all the time however our task
 
01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
here specifically from leadership is
 
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
that we propose any changes to improve
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
the funding formula to
 
01:47:58.430 --> 01:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
improve and and yes to improve this
 
01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
funding formula we're a subcommittee we
 
01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
have not had time even to scratch the
 
01:48:06.990 --> 01:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
surface really in terms of the inputs or
 
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
the other performance outcome
 
01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
methodology and we are scratching it yes
 
01:48:14.589 --> 01:48:14.599 align:start position:0%
and that other bill but we don't have
 
01:48:17.470 --> 01:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
resolution so we got to get there what
 
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
is the flight path from here to there
 
01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
and are we just going to have this all
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
of a sudden Boop like that or we going
 
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
to try to build it and give some support
 
01:48:28.229 --> 01:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
in in reflection to what we're actually
 
01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
doing right now with our current formula
 
01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
to we're not going to change just like
 
01:48:36.030 --> 01:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
that no no but and to your to your point
 
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair um we've got a report saying
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
that that it's estimated that the trust
 
01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
fund will have $182 million at the end
 
01:48:46.350 --> 01:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
of at the end of this year so J June
 
01:48:49.870 --> 01:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
30th 2024 if we're talking of Band-Aid
 
01:48:51.950 --> 01:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
which is is what you're proposing here
 
01:48:55.149 --> 01:48:55.159 align:start position:0%
which I think is a a good Band-Aid
 
01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
within the means that that we have I'm
 
01:48:59.669 --> 01:48:59.679 align:start position:0%
also looking for some change no no no I
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
but but if we're going to do a Band-Aid
 
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
W with change into the the three
 
01:49:08.350 --> 01:49:08.360 align:start position:0%
categories special education then then
 
01:49:10.589 --> 01:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
we should put that in as soon as
 
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
possible within the means that we have
 
01:49:16.109 --> 01:49:16.119 align:start position:0%
and we've got it right here $182 million
 
01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
um uh apply this not for FY 26 not for
 
01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
the next bium when there's going to be a
 
01:49:25.950 --> 01:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
new legislature but for
 
01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:29.239 align:start position:0%
fy2 put it in place for fy2 we can
 
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
afford to do that for FY 26 FY 27 the
 
01:49:34.830 --> 01:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
next bium we're going to have a new
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
legislature and I think that new
 
01:49:39.550 --> 01:49:39.560 align:start position:0%
legislature should absolutely be looking
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
at the work that we did back in 2020
 
01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
should be looking at the work that this
 
01:49:46.350 --> 01:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
committee does and to be thinking big in
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
terms of how we go about fixing school
 
01:49:50.430 --> 01:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
funding which we know is broken but we
 
01:49:52.589 --> 01:49:52.599 align:start position:0%
can't do that right now we can work
 
01:49:55.149 --> 01:49:55.159 align:start position:0%
within this we can make some meaningful
 
01:49:58.109 --> 01:49:58.119 align:start position:0%
improvements for our for our uh schools
 
01:50:02.189 --> 01:50:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:05.589 --> 01:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
fy2 but the but the next legislature is
 
01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
really going to have to not just be
 
01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
kicking the can down the road but to but
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
to actually fix this so Mr chair can we
 
01:50:14.270 --> 01:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
please hear from the superintendent from
 
01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
the school district that all this is all
 
01:50:18.910 --> 01:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
about just I think we really do need to
 
01:50:20.830 --> 01:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
have some information you're welcome to
 
01:50:24.350 --> 01:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
come forward and and present to us uh I
 
01:50:25.629 --> 01:50:25.639 align:start position:0%
don't want to get in a whole lot of
 
01:50:27.790 --> 01:50:27.800 align:start position:0%
discussion on these court cases though
 
01:50:29.550 --> 01:50:29.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go with conal or I'm
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
not going to go with binsky and all the
 
01:50:34.669 --> 01:50:34.679 align:start position:0%
all that right now Rand I think what we
 
01:50:38.109 --> 01:50:38.119 align:start position:0%
need to do is we need to have a plan to
 
01:50:38.119 --> 01:50:39.149 align:start position:0%
need to do is we need to have a plan to
move

01:50:39.149 --> 01:50:39.159 align:start position:0%
move
 
01:50:42.109 --> 01:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
forward and address some of the issues
 
01:50:45.069 --> 01:50:45.079 align:start position:0%
we have a current Formula obviously that
 
01:50:48.510 --> 01:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
uh needs some change now whether it's
 
01:50:51.950 --> 01:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
with that report with some
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
other result you know maybe even
 
01:50:58.229 --> 01:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
improving what we had because or maybe a
 
01:51:00.030 --> 01:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
blend of the two maybe some of the
 
01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
inputs have to be incorporated within
 
01:51:04.669 --> 01:51:04.679 align:start position:0%
that which it can be done maybe we have
 
01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
to look at that tax structure of some of
 
01:51:09.149 --> 01:51:09.159 align:start position:0%
that that has to be done as well so I'm
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
all for doing what you're you're saying
 
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
however I just want to make sure that we
 
01:51:18.189 --> 01:51:18.199 align:start position:0%
are recognizing saying yes we need if
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a formula that's
 
01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
based upon the present formula the
 
01:51:25.149 --> 01:51:25.159 align:start position:0%
formula has to move with the cost of
 
01:51:28.990 --> 01:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
doing business as well and it hasn't and
 
01:51:31.550 --> 01:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
the base cost has not been changed
 
01:51:33.709 --> 01:51:33.719 align:start position:0%
significantly uh the cost of all the
 
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
people within that the the the
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
responsibilties transportation
 
01:51:39.589 --> 01:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
maintenance hasn't changed looking at
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
new structures needed in schools it
 
01:51:43.069 --> 01:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't reflect that that's what we need
 
01:51:46.109 --> 01:51:46.119 align:start position:0%
to do I Concur and we also need to be
 
01:51:48.030 --> 01:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
recognizing it cost a whole lot more to
 
01:51:50.350 --> 01:51:50.360 align:start position:0%
educate a special education child with
 
01:51:53.069 --> 01:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
differ handicapping conditions and we
 
01:51:56.589 --> 01:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
want to have weighted this in in place
 
01:51:58.149 --> 01:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
in the formula so what's been what's
 
01:52:00.229 --> 01:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
been laid out today moves Us in the
 
01:52:02.709 --> 01:52:02.719 align:start position:0%
right direction us right and we can do
 
01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
it let's not wait to do it that's what
 
01:52:07.629 --> 01:52:07.639 align:start position:0%
I'm okay welcome hi Rick how are you
 
01:52:11.109 --> 01:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
fine I do not want your
 
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
job um so I am here because there seemed
 
01:52:17.310 --> 01:52:17.320 align:start position:0%
to be sign some significant questions um
 
01:52:21.390 --> 01:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
after I had left um testifying um in
 
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
support of HB 1583 about where that
 
01:52:26.189 --> 01:52:26.199 align:start position:0%
$10,000 number came from couple of
 
01:52:27.870 --> 01:52:27.880 align:start position:0%
things if I can react to some of the
 
01:52:30.350 --> 01:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
things that have been said based on what
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
I know about the funding formula and how
 
01:52:37.870 --> 01:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
much it cost toon a school district is
 
01:52:40.270 --> 01:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
that if you just looked at CPI if you
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
didn't do anything else nothing if you
 
01:52:45.870 --> 01:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
looked at CPI from the time from 2008 to
 
01:52:48.510 --> 01:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
today just CPI and that's not the
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
municipal price index that's the
 
01:52:52.350 --> 01:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
Consumer Price Index Municipal price
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
index tends to be a little
 
01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
higher adequacy would be 5 thou would be
 
01:52:59.629 --> 01:52:59.639 align:start position:0%
just above $5,000 so just as you're
 
01:53:01.030 --> 01:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
thinking about I think it's great that
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
you're trying to take an interm step and
 
01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
I think that that is the responsibility
 
01:53:07.629 --> 01:53:07.639 align:start position:0%
of this group certainly you have a banum
 
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
budget and you have to work within that
 
01:53:11.109 --> 01:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
and I certainly understand having to
 
01:53:13.709 --> 01:53:13.719 align:start position:0%
work within a a type budget so the
 
01:53:15.589 --> 01:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
$10,000 where did it come from so the
 
01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
$10,000 is directly correlated to the
 
01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
for the funding formula that was in 2008
 
01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
we actually didn't Veer that far from it
 
01:53:26.069 --> 01:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
we move we removed some things but what
 
01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
we did do was we created a or did inputs
 
01:53:34.069 --> 01:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
based on conservative real work costs
 
01:53:37.270 --> 01:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
from across multiple districts
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
originally when when I did it the first
 
01:53:41.950 --> 01:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
time we did just use conal but then we
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
adjusted those costs um and the first
 
01:53:47.149 --> 01:53:47.159 align:start position:0%
place that we looked at we actually kept
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
the information around first year
 
01:53:51.030 --> 01:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
teacher I don't have to tell you all
 
01:53:53.229 --> 01:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
that you can't you cannot possibly fill
 
01:53:54.589 --> 01:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
your entire building with a firste
 
01:53:56.350 --> 01:53:56.360 align:start position:0%
teacher um and the average teacher
 
01:53:58.990 --> 01:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
salary right now is is above
 
01:54:01.189 --> 01:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
$65,000 so that's the average teacher
 
01:54:02.550 --> 01:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
salary right now if you're looking at
 
01:54:04.830 --> 01:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
average teacher salaries we also looked
 
01:54:07.149 --> 01:54:07.159 align:start position:0%
at benefits those benefits that we are
 
01:54:10.189 --> 01:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
legally obligated to provide now one of
 
01:54:12.510 --> 01:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
the things that that certainly has been
 
01:54:15.550 --> 01:54:15.560 align:start position:0%
been um purported is that well you could
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
offer less of a benefits package well
 
01:54:17.679 --> 01:54:18.669 align:start position:0%
offer less of a benefits package well
the

01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:54:22.350 --> 01:54:22.360 align:start position:0%
state benefits package is very similar
 
01:54:23.950 --> 01:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
to the benefits package received by
 
01:54:26.350 --> 01:54:26.360 align:start position:0%
teachers and those benefits are
 
01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary to recruit and
 
01:54:31.470 --> 01:54:31.480 align:start position:0%
retain if we lower the
 
01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
benefits we're going to have to increase
 
01:54:36.149 --> 01:54:36.159 align:start position:0%
the salary in order to recruit and
 
01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
retain teachers I don't need to tell you
 
01:54:39.229 --> 01:54:39.239 align:start position:0%
that there's a teacher shortage because
 
01:54:40.910 --> 01:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
you probably read about that regularly
 
01:54:42.910 --> 01:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
that's a national teacher shortage not
 
01:54:46.030 --> 01:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
just in New Hampshire so the next place
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
that we really and I think one of the
 
01:54:49.830 --> 01:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
biggest places that we differentiate
 
01:54:54.589 --> 01:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
ated was in class size versus ratio
 
01:54:56.350 --> 01:54:56.360 align:start position:0%
those words get thrown around
 
01:54:58.669 --> 01:54:58.679 align:start position:0%
interchangeably in this room I noticed
 
01:55:02.430 --> 01:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
class ratio is very very
 
01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
different than student or than class
 
01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
size because while we talk about
 
01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
specialty teachers and we talk about
 
01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:16.719 align:start position:0%
those things we can't always have a
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
teacher in front of 25 students so if we
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
look at a high school for
 
01:55:25.870 --> 01:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
instance and you think about okay we
 
01:55:28.229 --> 01:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
have a 1 to 25 rati we're going to use
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
if we had a 1 to 25
 
01:55:33.189 --> 01:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
ratio in a high
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
school teachers are
 
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
contractually entitled to a prep period
 
01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
now you don't want to give them a prep
 
01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
period you say that's part of the
 
01:55:42.950 --> 01:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
contract negotiation okay let's we can
 
01:55:45.790 --> 01:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
have that conversation minimally we are
 
01:55:47.350 --> 01:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
required to provide them with a paid
 
01:55:49.589 --> 01:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
lunch so while they're at their paid
 
01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
paid lunch we still have to have
 
01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
somebody in front of the children we
 
01:55:57.790 --> 01:55:57.800 align:start position:0%
can't have all the teachers out in out
 
01:55:59.149 --> 01:55:59.159 align:start position:0%
out at lunch at the same time and we
 
01:56:00.750 --> 01:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
can't have all the students at lunch at
 
01:56:03.790 --> 01:56:03.800 align:start position:0%
the same time because our cafeterias are
 
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
not that big that is not
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
possible and then of course you still
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
need teachers to watch the
 
01:56:14.669 --> 01:56:14.679 align:start position:0%
students all right so maybe so we're
 
01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
just at our paid lunch if you use the 1
 
01:56:20.750 --> 01:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
to 25 or the 1 to 28 or the one to 30 if
 
01:56:22.430 --> 01:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
you're using the 1 to 30 that's high
 
01:56:25.629 --> 01:56:25.639 align:start position:0%
school grades 3 to 12 right that puts 40
 
01:56:27.910 --> 01:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
children in a classroom with a
 
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
teacher you can't you you have to use
 
01:56:34.750 --> 01:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
ratio you cannot use class size so when
 
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
we did the formula we looked at
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
historical ratios K to K12 they are 1 to
 
01:56:48.030 --> 01:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
9.96 and 1 to in in 3 to 12 is 1 to 12.6
 
01:56:52.149 --> 01:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
so we use ratios versus real ratios not
 
01:56:55.589 --> 01:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
class size and that is a very important
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
distinction now I am not saying that 1.9
 
01:57:02.550 --> 01:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
is ideal but we do live in a state that
 
01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:03.310 align:start position:0%
is ideal but we do live in a state that
is

01:57:03.310 --> 01:57:03.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:57:06.990 --> 01:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
rural okay my district in conell is 250
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
square miles we can consolidate with
 
01:57:11.030 --> 01:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
other districts absolutely we could do
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
that so then instead of paying for the
 
01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
classroom teacher and in instruction you
 
01:57:17.310 --> 01:57:17.320 align:start position:0%
are paying for
 
01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
transportation and you have to those the
 
01:57:22.510 --> 01:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
trade-offs so yeah maybe we could get to
 
01:57:26.310 --> 01:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
a 1 to 20 or a 1 to 25 ratio but the
 
01:57:28.750 --> 01:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
size of those districts would be
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
significant and students would spend
 
01:57:33.830 --> 01:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
significant time on school buses my
 
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
students regularly spend 45 minutes to
 
01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
an hour on a school bus 250 square miles
 
01:57:43.470 --> 01:57:43.480 align:start position:0%
buses Drive 3200 mil a day that's to
 
01:57:46.750 --> 01:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
California so the next um place that we
 
01:57:48.790 --> 01:57:48.800 align:start position:0%
we did look at that is different from
 
01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
the formula are services that aren't
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
included necessarily um and and what you
 
01:57:57.589 --> 01:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:01.270 --> 01:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
Services I um still remain shocked to
 
01:58:03.310 --> 01:58:03.320 align:start position:0%
some of the response that was to nursing
 
01:58:04.750 --> 01:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
services and I'm going to respect
 
01:58:08.950 --> 01:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
Representatives lad's um con guidance at
 
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
the beginning I don't want to talk about
 
01:58:13.470 --> 01:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
the court case but the bottom line is
 
01:58:15.470 --> 01:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
you cannot have school in this day and
 
01:58:19.109 --> 01:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
age without a nurse you have to have a
 
01:58:21.950 --> 01:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
nurse NSE now I don't like that either
 
01:58:24.189 --> 01:58:24.199 align:start position:0%
but the truth is we have students coming
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
to school that never came to school
 
01:58:28.990 --> 01:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
before you cannot ask a teacher or an
 
01:58:32.589 --> 01:58:32.599 align:start position:0%
admin assistant to provide the types of
 
01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
medications to students that some of our
 
01:58:38.069 --> 01:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
students require for instance the
 
01:58:40.629 --> 01:58:40.639 align:start position:0%
medication for
 
01:58:44.589 --> 01:58:44.599 align:start position:0%
severe severe seizures is given Rec can
 
01:58:46.030 --> 01:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
I interrupt just for a second of course
 
01:58:47.390 --> 01:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
you can and you have a question I'm
 
01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
happy well I don't have a question but
 
01:58:49.679 --> 01:58:50.550 align:start position:0%
happy well I don't have a question but
we

01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
recognize that uh nurse is a nurse is a
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
vital part of a school yep we're working
 
01:58:58.950 --> 01:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
with the formula we have here you're
 
01:59:01.350 --> 01:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
getting down into all those other inputs
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
and that's when you're talking ratio as
 
01:59:06.790 --> 01:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
well I am just talking about where the
 
01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:09.719 align:start position:0%
$10,000 came from that's why because we
 
01:59:11.990 --> 01:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
and I agree with you Rick we added that
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
we added the nursing Services because
 
01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
some of these services are not in their
 
01:59:19.950 --> 01:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
optional and statute right now
 
01:59:23.229 --> 01:59:23.239 align:start position:0%
um and and so we so if you have a child
 
01:59:25.709 --> 01:59:25.719 align:start position:0%
who has a seizure disorder or I have a
 
01:59:27.709 --> 01:59:27.719 align:start position:0%
child who is a type 1 diabetic that
 
01:59:30.629 --> 01:59:30.639 align:start position:0%
child cannot receive an adequate
 
01:59:33.189 --> 01:59:33.199 align:start position:0%
education or do any of those pieces that
 
01:59:35.390 --> 01:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
call for an adequate education if that
 
01:59:37.750 --> 01:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
nurse is not present if my I'm not
 
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
trying to argue with you I'm not
 
01:59:41.790 --> 01:59:41.800 align:start position:0%
objecting to it but that results in
 
01:59:45.270 --> 01:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
having a change statute right now got it
 
01:59:47.510 --> 01:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
and so we that's not one of the bills
 
01:59:48.910 --> 01:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
which we have in front of us and this is
 
01:59:52.870 --> 01:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
why I'm saying this is just starting out
 
01:59:54.669 --> 01:59:54.679 align:start position:0%
and we're going to have to look at all
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
these areas you're talking about great
 
01:59:58.709 --> 01:59:58.719 align:start position:0%
and I I hear what you're saying I'm just
 
02:00:01.510 --> 02:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
here to explain where the $10,000 number
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
came from um the other piece that and I
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
would ask you to consider is we removed
 
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
transportation and said that should be a
 
02:00:10.510 --> 02:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
separate Grant so Transportation wasn't
 
02:00:12.030 --> 02:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
even in the
 
02:00:16.189 --> 02:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
$10,000 um and that is because if you
 
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
look so if we take transportation from
 
02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:20.069 align:start position:0%
look so if we take transportation from
2018

02:00:20.069 --> 02:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
2018
 
02:00:22.510 --> 02:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
um in kentuk Valley that Transportation
 
02:00:25.589 --> 02:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
cost per pupil about
 
02:00:28.030 --> 02:00:28.040 align:start position:0%
$944 that does not include special ed
 
02:00:30.229 --> 02:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
Transportation which I can't answer for
 
02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Mello but um we don't we have about
 
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
$13 million in um special ed costs in
 
02:00:38.030 --> 02:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
our district and that does not include
 
02:00:39.910 --> 02:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation so
 
02:00:42.270 --> 02:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
$944 another
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:50.149 --> 02:00:50.159 align:start position:0%
$421 and therein lies the problem
 
02:00:52.069 --> 02:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
with the form with with that part of the
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
formula is right away that
 
02:00:57.589 --> 02:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
$500 per
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
child creates a significant inequity
 
02:01:04.709 --> 02:01:04.719 align:start position:0%
because money I have to spend and my the
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who live in the conville
 
02:01:10.149 --> 02:01:10.159 align:start position:0%
school districts has to spend just to
 
02:01:13.229 --> 02:01:13.239 align:start position:0%
get the child to school that other
 
02:01:16.350 --> 02:01:16.360 align:start position:0%
place can spend on instruction
 
02:01:19.790 --> 02:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
instruction materials teacher salary
 
02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:20.830 align:start position:0%
instruction materials teacher salary
nursing

02:01:20.830 --> 02:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
nursing
 
02:01:24.229 --> 02:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
services so there and and I think that
 
02:01:26.669 --> 02:01:26.679 align:start position:0%
you are that this committee
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
realizes that that there's some some
 
02:01:31.790 --> 02:01:31.800 align:start position:0%
very broken pieces
 
02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
here what I think you really need to
 
02:01:40.109 --> 02:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
consider is that that $10,000 is real
 
02:01:41.830 --> 02:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
give yourself
 
02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
Runway it's not there's no there's not
 
02:01:47.149 --> 02:01:47.159 align:start position:0%
$10,000 in the budget I'm assuming if
 
02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
there was I think that we would be
 
02:01:49.870 --> 02:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
having a different conversation right
 
02:01:53.069 --> 02:01:53.079 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury there's not
 
02:01:57.870 --> 02:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
$10,000 per student in this bium budget
 
02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
to to to
 
02:02:04.189 --> 02:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
pass 1583 but you do have the ability to
 
02:02:07.270 --> 02:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
amend 1583 and say it takes effect on
 
02:02:12.069 --> 02:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
such and such a date there is no
 
02:02:14.709 --> 02:02:14.719 align:start position:0%
doubt and anyone who comes up here and
 
02:02:16.830 --> 02:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
and wants to argue about base adequacy
 
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
and I've read the minutes from all the
 
02:02:22.629 --> 02:02:22.639 align:start position:0%
way back to 2008 so I know
 
02:02:25.990 --> 02:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative lad representative Miler
 
02:02:27.870 --> 02:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
that you knew when you created the
 
02:02:29.830 --> 02:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
formula that it wasn't enough
 
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
money there we know that base adequacy
 
02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
which is the
 
02:02:40.350 --> 02:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
floor for adequacy not minimum not
 
02:02:42.430 --> 02:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
minimum not the bare minimum that is not
 
02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
what the Constitution says in New
 
02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is not how it's been
 
02:02:50.109 --> 02:02:50.119 align:start position:0%
interpreted it is adequate
 
02:02:50.119 --> 02:02:51.310 align:start position:0%
interpreted it is adequate
is

02:02:51.310 --> 02:02:51.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:02:54.430 --> 02:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
$10,000 and if you want me to I what
 
02:02:55.990 --> 02:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
what spreadsheets do you want me to show
 
02:02:57.910 --> 02:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
you I I don't think you have to show us
 
02:03:01.310 --> 02:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
anything seeing that we we recognize
 
02:03:05.069 --> 02:03:05.079 align:start position:0%
that your your average teacher cost is
 
02:03:07.550 --> 02:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
is is not 65 is
 
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
$67,000 we recognize there's a lot of
 
02:03:12.510 --> 02:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
inputs which need to be addressed and
 
02:03:15.390 --> 02:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
even added into the base cost we we get
 
02:03:18.550 --> 02:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
that that's not going to be happening
 
02:03:20.990 --> 02:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
right here today seeing that this is a
 
02:03:24.990 --> 02:03:25.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee looking at those bills and
 
02:03:28.870 --> 02:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
but what has happened over the 35 years
 
02:03:33.189 --> 02:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
is that every two years this happens and
 
02:03:35.229 --> 02:03:35.239 align:start position:0%
everybody that's in this room because
 
02:03:37.830 --> 02:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
I've read the minute says you're right
 
02:03:39.149 --> 02:03:39.159 align:start position:0%
no I'm not I'm not sure that
 
02:03:40.709 --> 02:03:40.719 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli has actually
 
02:03:42.669 --> 02:03:42.679 align:start position:0%
ever said that it costs more money so I
 
02:03:42.679 --> 02:03:44.790 align:start position:0%
ever said that it costs more money so I
forgive

02:03:44.790 --> 02:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
forgive
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
me you're right it costs more money we
 
02:03:49.470 --> 02:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
know that
 
02:03:53.870 --> 02:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
and what I'm telling you what everything
 
02:03:56.669 --> 02:03:56.679 align:start position:0%
that I have looked at related to this
 
02:03:58.870 --> 02:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
and I have looked at all of the M
 
02:04:01.149 --> 02:04:01.159 align:start position:0%
minutes I have looked at all of the
 
02:04:02.790 --> 02:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
information I have looked at Sally
 
02:04:04.350 --> 02:04:04.360 align:start position:0%
fellow's works I've looked at Mark's
 
02:04:08.030 --> 02:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
work I've looked at everything because I
 
02:04:10.030 --> 02:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
was I got grilled for three
 
02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
days it cost
 
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
$10,000 actually
 
02:04:17.790 --> 02:04:17.800 align:start position:0%
$992 we'd be happy with
 
02:04:23.589 --> 02:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:26.549 --> 02:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
minimum don't kick this down the road
 
02:04:29.109 --> 02:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
because I have to and and I am not you
 
02:04:32.669 --> 02:04:32.679 align:start position:0%
know I'm I'm I'm reaching the end of my
 
02:04:34.669 --> 02:04:34.679 align:start position:0%
career I don't want to sit in any of
 
02:04:36.990 --> 02:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
those chairs I have no interest in
 
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
that but what I can tell you is that if
 
02:04:44.069 --> 02:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
you listened to newport's testimony if
 
02:04:47.109 --> 02:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
you listen to Don magon your concern
 
02:04:49.910 --> 02:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be the presid court case it
 
02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
should be the one that's going to come
 
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
from the ACLU and parents because their
 
02:04:56.910 --> 02:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
children aren receiving an adequate
 
02:05:00.750 --> 02:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
education you have downshifted this
 
02:05:03.189 --> 02:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
conversation to bare
 
02:05:06.109 --> 02:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
minimum that is not what these decisions
 
02:05:07.510 --> 02:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
have been
 
02:05:10.390 --> 02:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
about it isn't about the bare minimum it
 
02:05:13.990 --> 02:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
is about adequacy adequacy cost
 
02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
$10,000 I I think and you know everybody
 
02:05:19.310 --> 02:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
can say what they want about
 
02:05:23.390 --> 02:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
I what was it um Advocate advocacy from
 
02:05:25.950 --> 02:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
the judges I would remind you that the
 
02:05:27.510 --> 02:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
judges have made the clar the judges
 
02:05:28.950 --> 02:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
that made the Claremont decision pouring
 
02:05:30.510 --> 02:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
into the court business right now John
 
02:05:32.910 --> 02:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
sonunu do you have anything else for us
 
02:05:34.830 --> 02:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
and not unless you have questions for me
 
02:05:37.549 --> 02:05:37.559 align:start position:0%
it's clear that you you know that that
 
02:05:39.629 --> 02:05:39.639 align:start position:0%
both the Ed committee and and this
 
02:05:42.189 --> 02:05:42.199 align:start position:0%
committee are not particularly friendly
 
02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
to to to what I have to say I I think
 
02:05:48.790 --> 02:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
that you know again no matter what what
 
02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
the numbers are no matter what you do
 
02:05:53.390 --> 02:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
the bare the bare minimum if you want to
 
02:05:56.310 --> 02:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
put it that way is $10,000 are there any
 
02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
 
02:06:01.069 --> 02:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
representa luno thank you very much so
 
02:06:04.109 --> 02:06:04.119 align:start position:0%
so and and thank you Miss Anders for for
 
02:06:06.589 --> 02:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
um all the work you're doing not just as
 
02:06:08.950 --> 02:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
superintendent but also as an advocate
 
02:06:13.310 --> 02:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
for um for for real um costing and
 
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
funding for our for our Public Schools
 
02:06:21.870 --> 02:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
but I think you you you you had a very
 
02:06:25.229 --> 02:06:25.239 align:start position:0%
realistic observation in your comments
 
02:06:28.069 --> 02:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
just now when when uh when you said hey
 
02:06:29.350 --> 02:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
you know the state can't just
 
02:06:32.470 --> 02:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
manufacture dollars it can plan ahead to
 
02:06:34.990 --> 02:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
have dollars ready which it does every
 
02:06:37.350 --> 02:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
two years in a in a budget cycle but I
 
02:06:39.990 --> 02:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
can't just manufacture dollars and even
 
02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
when the state plans ahead we talk with
 
02:06:46.030 --> 02:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
people like Bruce canu and Keane from
 
02:06:47.390 --> 02:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
from Department of Revenue
 
02:06:49.229 --> 02:06:49.239 align:start position:0%
Administration that's a when you do
 
02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
change something it's going to take that
 
02:06:54.990 --> 02:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
amount of time for it to absolutely but
 
02:06:57.189 --> 02:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
we don't have to change anything and
 
02:06:59.350 --> 02:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
we've got $182 million sitting in the
 
02:07:00.990 --> 02:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
education trust fund at the end of this
 
02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
year what would you do with that well I
 
02:07:04.149 --> 02:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't dump it into the
 
02:07:07.990 --> 02:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
general fund I mean what what's what
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:07:12.629 --> 02:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
that that defeats the purpose of because
 
02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
then you're going to end up I mean when
 
02:07:15.430 --> 02:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
you start doing that you're going to end
 
02:07:17.390 --> 02:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
up in a in a situation where you don't
 
02:07:20.069 --> 02:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
have those dollars to tap into for other
 
02:07:21.870 --> 02:07:21.880 align:start position:0%
obligations by the way that that the
 
02:07:25.390 --> 02:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
legislature has created for for the
 
02:07:28.270 --> 02:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so you have the the you have
 
02:07:31.069 --> 02:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
the obligation of efas now those have
 
02:07:32.910 --> 02:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
that that money has to be raised and
 
02:07:35.510 --> 02:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
appropriated you have Charter School by
 
02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
the way you're not meeting the
 
02:07:37.790 --> 02:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
obligation to them
 
02:07:40.189 --> 02:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
either I think we need to get back to
 
02:07:42.669 --> 02:07:42.679 align:start position:0%
our business today right right so it's
 
02:07:44.910 --> 02:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
so so you're talking about yeah the the
 
02:07:46.589 --> 02:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
sheet that was handed out just yesterday
 
02:07:48.030 --> 02:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
the sheet that came out yesterday from
 
02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
Finance and I don't know if you got a
 
02:07:52.189 --> 02:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
copy of it but there was enough copies
 
02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
to go around and and um and and so
 
02:07:57.270 --> 02:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
there's been some discussion about
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
amending bills to be able to dig into to
 
02:08:06.990 --> 02:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
some of this and begin using using this
 
02:08:11.870 --> 02:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh starting July 1st 2024 for the
 
02:08:15.270 --> 02:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
upcoming school year is is that
 
02:08:17.870 --> 02:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
something that that that we should be
 
02:08:20.669 --> 02:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
looking at or should
 
02:08:23.470 --> 02:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
we I think using it and emptying it are
 
02:08:25.109 --> 02:08:25.119 align:start position:0%
two different different conversations
 
02:08:26.350 --> 02:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm talking about using it
 
02:08:28.830 --> 02:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
yeah for educ for for public school
 
02:08:31.669 --> 02:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
purposes well I think you have to use it
 
02:08:34.430 --> 02:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
to and and I'm and I'm sorry this
 
02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
probably isn't what you want me to say
 
02:08:39.030 --> 02:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
but you have to use that to meet the
 
02:08:41.629 --> 02:08:41.639 align:start position:0%
obligations that you guys have have made
 
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
that by the way you hadn't raised an
 
02:08:45.069 --> 02:08:45.079 align:start position:0%
appropriated for in the beginning you we
 
02:08:46.589 --> 02:08:46.599 align:start position:0%
didn't raise an appropriate money for
 
02:08:49.229 --> 02:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
efas where's that in the budget
 
02:08:51.870 --> 02:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
let's get down to where we are with this
 
02:08:53.990 --> 02:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
particular task today we're running out
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
of time here so if there no more
 
02:08:58.750 --> 02:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
questions I'm going to take a break here
 
02:09:00.430 --> 02:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a half hour lunch
 
02:09:02.470 --> 02:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
here we got to stand up and walk around
 
02:09:03.910 --> 02:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
then we want to come back and then we
 
02:09:05.870 --> 02:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
got to move forward with suggesting
 
02:09:08.270 --> 02:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
where are we going to go with these four
 
02:09:11.629 --> 02:09:11.639 align:start position:0%
bills and I want to get that done today
 
02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
so that we can get you know a mending
 
02:09:16.549 --> 02:09:16.559 align:start position:0%
language done so we can have it proper
 
02:09:19.069 --> 02:09:19.079 align:start position:0%
proper uh uh
 
02:09:21.310 --> 02:09:21.320 align:start position:0%
action on the policy committee which
 
02:09:25.069 --> 02:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
this is going to and then we'll we'll be
 
02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
much par me I can't see this yeah it
 
02:09:34.950 --> 02:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
would be according that time zone up
 
02:09:37.109 --> 02:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
there it' be right around 20 of unless
 
02:09:39.189 --> 02:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
somebody needs a little bit more time
 
02:09:43.189 --> 02:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
12:45 12:45 12:45
 
02:09:47.750 --> 02:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay round off thank you yeah we will
 
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
we'll get a
 
02:10:17.229 --> 02:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:17.239 --> 02:50:13.630 align:start position:0%
 
this

02:50:13.630 --> 02:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:13.640 --> 02:53:58.790 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:53:58.790 --> 02:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:01.750 --> 02:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
all this subcommittee back to order here
 
02:54:05.030 --> 02:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
um and there was some discussion prior
 
02:54:09.229 --> 02:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
to lunchtime if anybody got any lunch uh
 
02:54:12.630 --> 02:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
that uh we look at the right hand side
 
02:54:14.349 --> 02:54:14.359 align:start position:0%
of the column a little bit in terms
 
02:54:17.349 --> 02:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
terms of fiscal capacity we had
 
02:54:20.269 --> 02:54:20.279 align:start position:0%
discussion this morning about that not
 
02:54:21.990 --> 02:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
really into a whole lot but there was
 
02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:23.070 align:start position:0%
really into a whole lot but there was
passing

02:54:23.070 --> 02:54:23.080 align:start position:0%
passing
 
02:54:26.950 --> 02:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
discussion um does this group feel
 
02:54:29.550 --> 02:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable moving forward with making
 
02:54:31.630 --> 02:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
some changes on the base cost making
 
02:54:32.950 --> 02:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
some recommendations regarding
 
02:54:34.670 --> 02:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid we haven't talked
 
02:54:37.030 --> 02:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
swep yet either we need to talk that one
 
02:54:39.510 --> 02:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
but are you are we also interested while
 
02:54:42.670 --> 02:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking you know proposed needs or
 
02:54:45.269 --> 02:54:45.279 align:start position:0%
changes to the funding for form
 
02:54:46.750 --> 02:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
interested in talking about fiscal
 
02:54:49.269 --> 02:54:49.279 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity a as it was reflected
 
02:54:52.429 --> 02:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
in hb2 this last year that we're in
 
02:54:54.910 --> 02:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
represent Ames well I definitely am I
 
02:54:57.389 --> 02:54:57.399 align:start position:0%
think that uh on top of that the house
 
02:54:59.750 --> 02:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
was uh when we went through the budget
 
02:55:02.349 --> 02:55:02.359 align:start position:0%
process a year ago house position I
 
02:55:04.670 --> 02:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
think was uh supportive of what you're
 
02:55:06.110 --> 02:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
talking about fiscal the fiscal
 
02:55:08.070 --> 02:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
disparity a component is what I'm
 
02:55:11.469 --> 02:55:11.479 align:start position:0%
talking about and um it seems to fit it
 
02:55:15.229 --> 02:55:15.239 align:start position:0%
uh the amount involved is about right so
 
02:55:16.750 --> 02:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
it seems to fit into what we've been
 
02:55:19.070 --> 02:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
talking about as a
 
02:55:23.670 --> 02:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
one-time one-time input in future one
 
02:55:27.070 --> 02:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
time and that was that was a hold over
 
02:55:31.030 --> 02:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
from HB 1680 was it uh was that in 1680
 
02:55:31.040 --> 02:55:32.110 align:start position:0%
from HB 1680 was it uh was that in 1680
repent

02:55:32.110 --> 02:55:32.120 align:start position:0%
repent
 
02:55:36.150 --> 02:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
luno fiscal cap fiscal capacity bu in
 
02:55:39.510 --> 02:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
1680 no it was no it
 
02:55:42.150 --> 02:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't Aon Hennessy's was extraordinary
 
02:55:50.190 --> 02:55:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:54.870 --> 02:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
yeah9 okay yeah uhhuh was also in what
 
02:55:56.950 --> 02:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
we what we
 
02:56:06.030 --> 02:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:09.309 --> 02:56:09.319 align:start position:0%
division it was it was in the house past
 
02:56:12.110 --> 02:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
version of hb2 and excised by the Senate
 
02:56:13.429 --> 02:56:13.439 align:start position:0%
and since we didn't have a conference
 
02:56:15.229 --> 02:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
committee that disc discussion was over
 
02:56:17.710 --> 02:56:17.720 align:start position:0%
so let's throw it back to them yeah yeah
 
02:56:19.870 --> 02:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
so I was just pulling up what was the
 
02:56:23.990 --> 02:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:29.190 align:start position:0%
 
capacity

02:56:29.190 --> 02:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:38.790 --> 02:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:41.030 --> 02:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
million so it's the same order of
 
02:56:43.150 --> 02:56:43.160 align:start position:0%
magnitude of what we were discussing
 
02:56:45.910 --> 02:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
already this morning
 
02:56:48.830 --> 02:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that go ahead one
 
02:56:50.469 --> 02:56:50.479 align:start position:0%
of the things that continues to concern
 
02:56:54.510 --> 02:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
me it's a data the sources of data um
 
02:56:56.389 --> 02:56:56.399 align:start position:0%
and I know I'm like a broken record
 
02:56:58.550 --> 02:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
about Hospital 601 and the direct
 
02:57:01.070 --> 02:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid certification if there was some
 
02:57:04.870 --> 02:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
way to to get our data better and I I
 
02:57:07.229 --> 02:57:07.239 align:start position:0%
know in my city of Manchester it really
 
02:57:09.950 --> 02:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
matters we are not getting the people
 
02:57:11.510 --> 02:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
aren't filling out the forms because
 
02:57:14.070 --> 02:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
during covid they didn't have to so now
 
02:57:16.229 --> 02:57:16.239 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden I I hear the school of
 
02:57:18.550 --> 02:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
the school board chair you
 
02:57:20.990 --> 02:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
know making all kinds of announcements
 
02:57:22.910 --> 02:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
to parents please will you fill in those
 
02:57:25.790 --> 02:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
forms so that that's been a concern of
 
02:57:28.670 --> 02:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
mine and I know that Medicaid was skewed
 
02:57:31.269 --> 02:57:31.279 align:start position:0%
previously because everybody pretty much
 
02:57:33.349 --> 02:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
could be on Medicaid if they applied for
 
02:57:35.469 --> 02:57:35.479 align:start position:0%
it but now those numbers I believe are
 
02:57:38.550 --> 02:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
better if I'm I'm correct on that Mark
 
02:57:42.030 --> 02:57:42.040 align:start position:0%
the the is the data better in that area
 
02:57:45.910 --> 02:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
dfr data yes is moving closer to well we
 
02:57:49.309 --> 02:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
would say status quo so pre pandemic um
 
02:57:52.229 --> 02:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
so yes the data stabilized the
 
02:57:55.070 --> 02:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
pmic reduction in counts because the
 
02:57:59.030 --> 02:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
USDA W the data is
 
02:58:01.790 --> 02:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
stabilizing good thank
 
02:58:05.870 --> 02:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
you if we do have a I think we have a
 
02:58:08.590 --> 02:58:08.600 align:start position:0%
bill that we have not acted upon that
 
02:58:11.710 --> 02:58:11.720 align:start position:0%
deals with um
 
02:58:14.070 --> 02:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid personal identification of
 
02:58:15.550 --> 02:58:15.560 align:start position:0%
information I think or something such
 
02:58:18.670 --> 02:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
that but any rate I don't want to go in
 
02:58:20.710 --> 02:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
that direction here right now my Lord we
 
02:58:23.790 --> 02:58:23.800 align:start position:0%
have all this other stuff on our plate
 
02:58:28.070 --> 02:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah okay um so fiscal capacity is
 
02:58:33.229 --> 02:58:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:37.550 --> 02:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:40.630 --> 02:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
it statement no
 
02:58:42.910 --> 02:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
I I don't have my computer with me
 
02:58:42.920 --> 02:58:45.190 align:start position:0%
I I don't have my computer with me
either

02:58:45.190 --> 02:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
either
 
02:58:47.830 --> 02:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
Mark Mark do you have any information I
 
02:58:51.990 --> 02:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:56.349 --> 02:58:56.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:08.429 --> 02:59:08.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:12.830 --> 02:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:12.840 --> 02:59:15.550 align:start position:0%
 
bag

02:59:15.550 --> 02:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
bag
 
02:59:18.269 --> 02:59:18.279 align:start position:0%
we won't go with that uh okay Mark do
 
02:59:20.070 --> 02:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
you have any anything you could help us
 
02:59:22.229 --> 02:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
out with in this discussion of fiscal
 
02:59:25.070 --> 02:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
capacity dispari already now you're more
 
02:59:26.510 --> 02:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
in a better
 
02:59:30.389 --> 02:59:30.399 align:start position:0%
move back grounded on Earth
 
02:59:33.150 --> 02:59:33.160 align:start position:0%
again uh yeah I'm just trying to go back
 
02:59:35.349 --> 02:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
in time to what the house division 2
 
02:59:37.469 --> 02:59:37.479 align:start position:0%
passed um and you guys the discussion as
 
02:59:39.269 --> 02:59:39.279 align:start position:0%
far as the House and Senate negotiations
 
02:59:43.190 --> 02:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
and then um uh I think your all your
 
02:59:45.030 --> 02:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
Collective memory is is correct I'm just
 
02:59:48.510 --> 02:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
trying to get the numbers um yeah it
 
02:59:50.309 --> 02:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
looks like the amendment it was
 
02:59:55.830 --> 02:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1170 that division 2 went with
 
03:00:00.469 --> 03:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
um division 2 was interested
 
03:00:03.469 --> 03:00:03.479 align:start position:0%
in increasing extraordinary needs Grant
 
03:00:07.349 --> 03:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:11.349 --> 03:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
law uh I'm trying to find it's actually
 
03:00:13.790 --> 03:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
hard to keep track of this but I believe
 
03:00:15.870 --> 03:00:15.880 align:start position:0%
I believe with division 2's then we're
 
03:00:17.910 --> 03:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
talking about the the budget here I
 
03:00:19.469 --> 03:00:19.479 align:start position:0%
believe you were doing fiscal capacity
 
03:00:22.229 --> 03:00:22.239 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid and I think you were doing
 
03:00:25.229 --> 03:00:25.239 align:start position:0%
did you add just the fnr aid only I
 
03:00:25.239 --> 03:00:27.269 align:start position:0%
did you add just the fnr aid only I
think

03:00:27.269 --> 03:00:27.279 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:00:27.279 --> 03:00:28.950 align:start position:0%
think
that's

03:00:28.950 --> 03:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:00:31.349 --> 03:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
but but regardless of what you did back
 
03:00:33.630 --> 03:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
then uh I think what the the
 
03:00:34.910 --> 03:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
conversations I remember the house
 
03:00:37.830 --> 03:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
division 2 having back then was um
 
03:00:40.510 --> 03:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs just to go back to
 
03:00:42.030 --> 03:00:42.040 align:start position:0%
the two all the different Grant Vehicles
 
03:00:43.110 --> 03:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of vehicles you can choose
 
03:00:44.670 --> 03:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
to fund a lot lot of methodologies a lot
 
03:00:46.229 --> 03:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
of ratios you can choose to fund
 
03:00:49.229 --> 03:00:49.239 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs is property over fnr
 
03:00:52.150 --> 03:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
counts so it's your property values
 
03:00:54.550 --> 03:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
relative to your fnr counts so it's
 
03:00:55.910 --> 03:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
really only going to be targeted to
 
03:00:58.389 --> 03:00:58.399 align:start position:0%
communities that have two things low
 
03:01:00.990 --> 03:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
property values and high fnr counts it's
 
03:01:02.950 --> 03:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
all relative speaking it's all based on
 
03:01:05.150 --> 03:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
a Statewide average so that's how
 
03:01:06.790 --> 03:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant works so
 
03:01:09.510 --> 03:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
basically those two metrics relatively
 
03:01:12.030 --> 03:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
speaking needs to be achieved um fiscal
 
03:01:14.950 --> 03:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity Aid does not
 
03:01:18.750 --> 03:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
consider fnr data it just goes students
 
03:01:22.389 --> 03:01:22.399 align:start position:0%
over or sorry property over students
 
03:01:25.150 --> 03:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
so it it it it it hits some different
 
03:01:27.269 --> 03:01:27.279 align:start position:0%
communities it would fiscal capacity
 
03:01:29.269 --> 03:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid is going to be hit some
 
03:01:30.710 --> 03:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
communities that extraordinary needs
 
03:01:33.630 --> 03:01:33.640 align:start position:0%
Grant does not so I think kind of just
 
03:01:35.309 --> 03:01:35.319 align:start position:0%
throwing out maybe gtown as an example
 
03:01:36.429 --> 03:01:36.439 align:start position:0%
but there's some communities where their
 
03:01:40.229 --> 03:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
fnr numbers are average or below average
 
03:01:43.309 --> 03:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
but their evpp is really low so their
 
03:01:45.269 --> 03:01:45.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity aid grant is
 
03:01:47.229 --> 03:01:47.239 align:start position:0%
going to be higher um where they're not
 
03:01:48.429 --> 03:01:48.439 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to get hit with the
 
03:01:50.790 --> 03:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant Target um so
 
03:01:54.349 --> 03:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
and I believe what I how things ended up
 
03:01:57.309 --> 03:01:57.319 align:start position:0%
um the house position previously was
 
03:01:59.990 --> 03:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
that the house division 2 liked they
 
03:02:01.550 --> 03:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
liked extraordinary needs grant for what
 
03:02:04.150 --> 03:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
it did they liked uh I believe they
 
03:02:06.429 --> 03:02:06.439 align:start position:0%
liked physical capacity disparity for
 
03:02:08.229 --> 03:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
what it did and then they wanted one
 
03:02:11.910 --> 03:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
metric that was just fnr only and so
 
03:02:13.269 --> 03:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
just to go back to the progression of
 
03:02:16.670 --> 03:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
time uh the 2021 one Aid component uh
 
03:02:18.389 --> 03:02:18.399 align:start position:0%
there was $60 million that include
 
03:02:20.830 --> 03:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity Aid which is
 
03:02:23.750 --> 03:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
property values over pupils and then it
 
03:02:26.150 --> 03:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
included f&amp;r raid which just looked at
 
03:02:28.070 --> 03:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
fnr ratios for each community and didn't
 
03:02:29.630 --> 03:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
care about the property values within
 
03:02:32.150 --> 03:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
those communities um that's
 
03:02:36.670 --> 03:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
2021 um that was a onetime boost um then
 
03:02:38.389 --> 03:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
um extraordinary needs Grant came into
 
03:02:39.630 --> 03:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
effect in
 
03:02:42.630 --> 03:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
23 um by that time fiscal capacity
 
03:02:45.469 --> 03:02:45.479 align:start position:0%
disparity it had already expired um and
 
03:02:49.030 --> 03:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
fnr additional Aid um was still in the
 
03:02:53.349 --> 03:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
budget um it was um called relief Aid so
 
03:02:54.910 --> 03:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity Aid we have
 
03:02:57.870 --> 03:02:57.880 align:start position:0%
not seen that since 21 in the formula um
 
03:03:00.870 --> 03:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
fnr focused Aid um we've seen that in
 
03:03:04.070 --> 03:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
the budget uh in 21 we saw that in 22 as
 
03:03:07.590 --> 03:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
relief Aid um and we don't see it in 23
 
03:03:09.510 --> 03:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
and now the only sort of right side
 
03:03:11.510 --> 03:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
grant that we have is extraordinary
 
03:03:14.590 --> 03:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
needs Grant and so and the hold harmless
 
03:03:17.070 --> 03:03:17.080 align:start position:0%
yes and stabilization gone yeah lot lots
 
03:03:20.750 --> 03:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
happen but but um I the the the S of
 
03:03:23.030 --> 03:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
policy discussion uh or policy
 
03:03:25.229 --> 03:03:25.239 align:start position:0%
discussions that I I witnessed back when
 
03:03:27.269 --> 03:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
all of you were considering that is all
 
03:03:28.670 --> 03:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
these different mechanisms have
 
03:03:30.190 --> 03:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
different targets that they're hitting
 
03:03:32.990 --> 03:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
so extraordinary needs Grant um to some
 
03:03:34.710 --> 03:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
extent Blends the targets because it
 
03:03:37.830 --> 03:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
grabs property and fnr so it's sort of
 
03:03:40.790 --> 03:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
taking it's more kind of efficiently
 
03:03:43.110 --> 03:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
using one mechanism to describe two
 
03:03:43.120 --> 03:03:44.070 align:start position:0%
using one mechanism to describe two
phenomen

03:03:44.070 --> 03:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
phenomen
 
03:03:45.950 --> 03:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
property and poverty um where the
 
03:03:48.670 --> 03:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
different the different other programs
 
03:03:50.590 --> 03:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
um isolate one metric and fund it
 
03:03:52.269 --> 03:03:52.279 align:start position:0%
isolate one metric and fund it isolate
 
03:03:55.349 --> 03:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
one metric and fund it um so those are
 
03:03:56.630 --> 03:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
the those are the policy discussions I
 
03:03:59.950 --> 03:03:59.960 align:start position:0%
remember you guys having um last
 
03:04:02.550 --> 03:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
budget L yeah so thank you Mr chair and
 
03:04:05.750 --> 03:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks Mark um yeah extraordinary
 
03:04:07.030 --> 03:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
I think you described extraordinary
 
03:04:10.030 --> 03:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
needs very well um but when you're when
 
03:04:11.950 --> 03:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
you're when you're blending fiscal
 
03:04:13.910 --> 03:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
capacity or you know uh property
 
03:04:15.830 --> 03:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
valuation and poverty you're talking
 
03:04:17.070 --> 03:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
about two different things you're
 
03:04:19.790 --> 03:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
talking about a resource factor which is
 
03:04:21.990 --> 03:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
property valuations and poverty is a
 
03:04:25.870 --> 03:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
cost Factor so so so when you blend them
 
03:04:29.150 --> 03:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
together it's it's you're you're you're
 
03:04:30.670 --> 03:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
you're you're not addressing poverty
 
03:04:32.269 --> 03:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
every place it is and you're not
 
03:04:35.110 --> 03:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
addressing um access to property value
 
03:04:38.070 --> 03:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
everywhere and your poverty uh metric is
 
03:04:40.150 --> 03:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
already embedded in base adequacy I mean
 
03:04:42.190 --> 03:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
in the differentiated age correct
 
03:04:45.389 --> 03:04:45.399 align:start position:0%
correct so a pure play on the the
 
03:04:47.229 --> 03:04:47.239 align:start position:0%
property value correction should be one
 
03:04:49.590 --> 03:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
of the components in addition to base
 
03:04:52.030 --> 03:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
adequacy and differentiated a correct
 
03:04:53.750 --> 03:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
and and when I look back at it and I
 
03:04:56.550 --> 03:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
think um Mr chair you were talking about
 
03:04:58.910 --> 03:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
what what we were working on for hb2 was
 
03:05:00.910 --> 03:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
based on a bill we worked on together
 
03:05:01.990 --> 03:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:05:04.670 --> 03:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
529 that was yeah that's the bill so I
 
03:05:07.910 --> 03:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
just found it and and at least my my
 
03:05:12.070 --> 03:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
most recent um look at that your your
 
03:05:13.590 --> 03:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
your memory is absolutely correct there
 
03:05:16.030 --> 03:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
were two components to the quote right
 
03:05:20.469 --> 03:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
side um of the of the formula a fiscal
 
03:05:23.070 --> 03:05:23.080 align:start position:0%
capacity component which was a little
 
03:05:26.750 --> 03:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
over $42 million almost $43 million and
 
03:05:28.790 --> 03:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
then a and then an enhanced free
 
03:05:31.670 --> 03:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
introduced lunch which is looks like
 
03:05:34.550 --> 03:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
10.3 um million dollar so addressing
 
03:05:37.950 --> 03:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
those two components uh
 
03:05:40.510 --> 03:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
separately represent cordelli the other
 
03:05:44.309 --> 03:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
thing uh the U I'm sorry
 
03:05:47.030 --> 03:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
didn't I didn't realize yeah um I did
 
03:05:50.950 --> 03:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
find a uh floor amendment to
 
03:05:54.429 --> 03:05:54.439 align:start position:0%
hb2 um lad luno Emer and
 
03:06:00.269 --> 03:06:00.279 align:start position:0%
Heath um Amendment 1285 H that has um
 
03:06:02.790 --> 03:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
adjustments to the three components
 
03:06:05.590 --> 03:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal disparity Aid extraordinary needs
 
03:06:08.950 --> 03:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
and the relief Grant it has revised but
 
03:06:11.830 --> 03:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
I I don't see a you know a total number
 
03:06:14.950 --> 03:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
okay or fiscal not any kind associated
 
03:06:17.590 --> 03:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
with the uh floor
 
03:06:19.790 --> 03:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
amendment I want
 
03:06:22.630 --> 03:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
toed I believe so I haven't checked it
 
03:06:25.630 --> 03:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
on or anything I got uh just the
 
03:06:28.630 --> 03:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
reference for what the house adopted
 
03:06:30.950 --> 03:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
version of
 
03:06:34.710 --> 03:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
hb2 uh is section 149 of
 
03:06:37.590 --> 03:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
hb2 and that's fiscal it's called fiscal
 
03:06:39.590 --> 03:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid what was the section
 
03:06:44.750 --> 03:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
number again 149 okay now before that as
 
03:06:48.269 --> 03:06:48.279 align:start position:0%
was mentioned um there were
 
03:06:50.750 --> 03:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
calculations of what the formula that's
 
03:06:53.910 --> 03:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
in that 149
 
03:06:57.229 --> 03:06:57.239 align:start position:0%
produces and I'm sure that we can dig
 
03:06:57.239 --> 03:06:59.349 align:start position:0%
produces and I'm sure that we can dig
that

03:06:59.349 --> 03:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:07:02.830 --> 03:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
up I don't know just what it
 
03:07:07.429 --> 03:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
was well once again by addressing this
 
03:07:08.870 --> 03:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
we do help on the other side of the
 
03:07:10.630 --> 03:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
formula we don't help them all because
 
03:07:14.030 --> 03:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
with property over top of fnr are some
 
03:07:16.190 --> 03:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
of the or excuse me on fiscal cap
 
03:07:17.389 --> 03:07:17.399 align:start position:0%
property over the
 
03:07:19.630 --> 03:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
students some districts don't have many
 
03:07:21.469 --> 03:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
students and so they're not really going
 
03:07:22.910 --> 03:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
to get that but they are very poor
 
03:07:24.229 --> 03:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
districts and they're required to
 
03:07:26.229 --> 03:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
provide all the programming that another
 
03:07:28.389 --> 03:07:28.399 align:start position:0%
one is and I think that captures a lot
 
03:07:32.309 --> 03:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
of communities where I live and so
 
03:07:34.710 --> 03:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
um one of the foundational things is
 
03:07:36.750 --> 03:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
there's a geographic thing also in there
 
03:07:38.710 --> 03:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
or size of school or something such as
 
03:07:41.870 --> 03:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
that as a as a weighted Factor but see
 
03:07:45.429 --> 03:07:45.439 align:start position:0%
we're not going there right now now so
 
03:07:49.309 --> 03:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
um the I do have a number yeah okay
 
03:07:52.110 --> 03:07:52.120 align:start position:0%
that's where it's going to go uh so that
 
03:07:54.910 --> 03:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
the increase from current law proposed
 
03:07:57.070 --> 03:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
by HB
 
03:08:02.110 --> 03:08:02.120 align:start position:0%
529 fiscal capacity disparity Aid in
 
03:08:06.590 --> 03:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
my computer here it's at 85.8 million
 
03:08:09.150 --> 03:08:09.160 align:start position:0%
just for that one component y when we
 
03:08:12.550 --> 03:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
when we did 529 then we prob it back yes
 
03:08:12.560 --> 03:08:13.950 align:start position:0%
when we did 529 then we prob it back yes
based

03:08:13.950 --> 03:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
based
 
03:08:16.349 --> 03:08:16.359 align:start position:0%
what what we had to work with Okay so
 
03:08:21.229 --> 03:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:26.110 --> 03:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
the conceptually can we just agree that
 
03:08:28.349 --> 03:08:28.359 align:start position:0%
we want to reinstate the position of the
 
03:08:30.510 --> 03:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
house whatever that was whatever that
 
03:08:33.710 --> 03:08:33.720 align:start position:0%
quantity was and uh send that back to
 
03:08:33.720 --> 03:08:34.830 align:start position:0%
quantity was and uh send that back to
the

03:08:34.830 --> 03:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:08:38.190 --> 03:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
Senate the way it landed uh in the final
 
03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
house vote this spring this last
 
03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:53.469 align:start position:0%
house vote this spring this last
spring

03:08:53.469 --> 03:08:53.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:55.710 --> 03:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
well we we initially started out at
 
03:08:59.030 --> 03:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
48 in the floor Amendment it was $4,000
 
03:09:02.469 --> 03:09:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:05.429 --> 03:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
admr we couldn't get David we couldn't
 
03:09:07.630 --> 03:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
get to the other side what happened with
 
03:09:09.830 --> 03:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
towns like Berlin and those places
 
03:09:11.750 --> 03:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
Rochester were coming out lower and
 
03:09:14.790 --> 03:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
lower if we had the base higher but I
 
03:09:16.550 --> 03:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
thought the base we did make a higher
 
03:09:16.560 --> 03:09:17.750 align:start position:0%
thought the base we did make a higher
base

03:09:17.750 --> 03:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
base
 
03:09:17.760 --> 03:09:20.429 align:start position:0%
base
in

03:09:20.429 --> 03:09:20.439 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:09:22.750 --> 03:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
compromise accept the governor's B I
 
03:09:24.429 --> 03:09:24.439 align:start position:0%
believe we didn't accept the governor
 
03:09:28.790 --> 03:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
4,800 ours was lower 4700 ours was lower
 
03:09:30.870 --> 03:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
ours was lower than that I thought
 
03:09:32.469 --> 03:09:32.479 align:start position:0%
according to this four
 
03:09:35.030 --> 03:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh it was increased from
 
03:09:41.790 --> 03:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:44.510 --> 03:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
4,000 right
 
03:09:48.870 --> 03:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
yeah the 41 we put we put our emphasis
 
03:09:50.070 --> 03:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
on the
 
03:09:52.510 --> 03:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
right because then we adjusted because
 
03:09:54.389 --> 03:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
that went into the charter school
 
03:09:57.790 --> 03:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
funding and we adjusted that from the
 
03:10:00.550 --> 03:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
nine it would have been $99,100 we
 
03:10:03.269 --> 03:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
throttle that back to 9,000 for a Char
 
03:10:05.110 --> 03:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
of school student that was all part of
 
03:10:06.510 --> 03:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
the compromise
 
03:10:08.670 --> 03:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
too what would happen if we left the
 
03:10:11.269 --> 03:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
basee where it is at 4186 and then put
 
03:10:13.630 --> 03:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
the difference of the
 
03:10:13.640 --> 03:10:15.269 align:start position:0%
the difference of the
44

03:10:15.269 --> 03:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
44
 
03:10:18.590 --> 03:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
45 over in fiscal capacity rather than
 
03:10:22.229 --> 03:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
in base adequacy I I I hear what you're
 
03:10:25.110 --> 03:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
saying and you know that's where where I
 
03:10:28.269 --> 03:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
you know that that that is an equity
 
03:10:31.190 --> 03:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
driven result as opposed
 
03:10:34.389 --> 03:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
to we not here
 
03:10:36.750 --> 03:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think that's that's the
 
03:10:38.469 --> 03:10:38.479 align:start position:0%
challenge when you put it you know if
 
03:10:40.630 --> 03:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
you put it all towards the base it does
 
03:10:43.870 --> 03:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
very little to for a whole lot of
 
03:10:51.269 --> 03:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:54.429 --> 03:10:54.439 align:start position:0%
side but I think the formula had was
 
03:10:59.830 --> 03:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
Heavy F fnr because we we dumped in I
 
03:11:01.349 --> 03:11:01.359 align:start position:0%
don't even remember how much of the last
 
03:11:04.469 --> 03:11:04.479 align:start position:0%
minute was that we piled on the right
 
03:11:07.190 --> 03:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
hand side and 80% of it went to
 
03:11:09.670 --> 03:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
Nashville Manchester and Conquer it
 
03:11:12.070 --> 03:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
didn't reach the outer banks that we
 
03:11:15.190 --> 03:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to reach it it it reached places
 
03:11:17.750 --> 03:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
that had high fnr and we couldn't get to
 
03:11:20.190 --> 03:11:20.200 align:start position:0%
it unless we did put a stabilization in
 
03:11:22.630 --> 03:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
we had a percentage of stabilization
 
03:11:24.990 --> 03:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
that brought back like Berlin Rochester
 
03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:25.710 align:start position:0%
that brought back like Berlin Rochester
really

03:11:25.710 --> 03:11:25.720 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:11:29.710 --> 03:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
been well yeah and and and that's why I
 
03:11:33.469 --> 03:11:33.479 align:start position:0%
think on the 529 work we did we we went
 
03:11:36.630 --> 03:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
with this disparity that was about four
 
03:11:39.870 --> 03:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
times more than the than the fnr because
 
03:11:41.750 --> 03:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
that reached out
 
03:11:54.030 --> 03:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:56.229 --> 03:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
hadre away
 
03:11:59.229 --> 03:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
from don't we think the courts we just
 
03:12:02.150 --> 03:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
to do something on the base I really
 
03:12:04.630 --> 03:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
politically I think we're you know we
 
03:12:06.030 --> 03:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to shoot ourselves in the
 
03:12:08.950 --> 03:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
court I mean we're together for this
 
03:12:11.190 --> 03:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
reason I think your approach is better
 
03:12:13.750 --> 03:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
though I I would M with right now say
 
03:12:17.110 --> 03:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it gradually and take
 
03:12:19.309 --> 03:12:19.319 align:start position:0%
the two items that we discussed before
 
03:12:23.510 --> 03:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
lunch and do those two steps and not not
 
03:12:27.190 --> 03:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
try to make hanell happy right out of of
 
03:12:29.190 --> 03:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
the gate well they're not going be happy
 
03:12:30.070 --> 03:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
because we don't have that type of
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
dollar well what about breaking special
 
03:12:36.349 --> 03:12:36.359 align:start position:0%
UC oh yeah saying all the things we
 
03:12:38.469 --> 03:12:38.479 align:start position:0%
talked about before lunch those
 
03:12:41.510 --> 03:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
amendments absolutely but I think and
 
03:12:44.070 --> 03:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
then we rep your committee gets to
 
03:12:46.070 --> 03:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
represent well they you're trying to do
 
03:12:49.510 --> 03:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
it in a in a steep manner rather than
 
03:12:53.269 --> 03:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden a giant the the the
 
03:12:56.110 --> 03:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
weighted excuse me sorry the weighted
 
03:12:57.870 --> 03:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
amounts there in the differentiated were
 
03:12:59.510 --> 03:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
based off the
 
03:13:02.950 --> 03:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
$444 base so that's upping the base from
 
03:13:07.710 --> 03:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:11.309 --> 03:13:11.319 align:start position:0%
now yeah yeah yeah you know if you if
 
03:13:13.830 --> 03:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
your base goes up more then with the
 
03:13:15.309 --> 03:13:15.319 align:start position:0%
limited dollars we probably have to go
 
03:13:17.590 --> 03:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
with a lower factor for differentiate
 
03:13:19.389 --> 03:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
Aid special ed well if you're not doing
 
03:13:21.030 --> 03:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
anything in the
 
03:13:21.040 --> 03:13:31.389 align:start position:0%
anything in the
face

03:13:31.389 --> 03:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:33.750 --> 03:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
put but you know if you put it on the
 
03:13:35.269 --> 03:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
right hand side of the
 
03:13:37.190 --> 03:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
column that's
 
03:13:41.550 --> 03:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
not that's not adequacy I
 
03:13:41.560 --> 03:13:43.469 align:start position:0%
not that's not adequacy I
know

03:13:43.469 --> 03:13:43.479 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:13:45.229 --> 03:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
special education that's why I think
 
03:13:48.510 --> 03:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
this weighted we got to do that but you
 
03:13:51.190 --> 03:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
know if we have other money right now I
 
03:13:52.630 --> 03:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
think we ought to put it on the base but
 
03:13:54.550 --> 03:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
then also then
 
03:13:58.429 --> 03:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
recommend that we conceptu recognize the
 
03:14:00.590 --> 03:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
need for fiscal capacity disparity I
 
03:14:01.950 --> 03:14:01.960 align:start position:0%
don't know if I have an exact figure we
 
03:14:03.150 --> 03:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
should use that right whether it should
 
03:14:06.630 --> 03:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
be 70 or you know we're creeping up to
 
03:14:11.469 --> 03:14:11.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:16.469 --> 03:14:16.479 align:start position:0%
million2 you then you're exhausting that
 
03:14:20.190 --> 03:14:20.200 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr chairman yeah just an effort to
 
03:14:22.670 --> 03:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
reconcile a whole bunch of comments that
 
03:14:25.389 --> 03:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
have already been said uh you're on a
 
03:14:28.910 --> 03:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
type timeline you're looking to uh uh to
 
03:14:31.269 --> 03:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
report to the floor and it's a two
 
03:14:35.389 --> 03:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
commmittee bill so let's I would suggest
 
03:14:38.229 --> 03:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
that go ahead and amend 1583 the way
 
03:14:41.070 --> 03:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
you've proposed it it introduces the
 
03:14:43.550 --> 03:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
categories it raises the levels both of
 
03:14:47.349 --> 03:14:47.359 align:start position:0%
base adequacy and set it on uh the way
 
03:14:51.309 --> 03:14:51.319 align:start position:0%
you had it July 1 125 as an effective
 
03:14:53.710 --> 03:14:53.720 align:start position:0%
date get it to the floor get it past get
 
03:14:56.870 --> 03:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
it to finance amend a different vehicle
 
03:14:58.750 --> 03:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
putting inadequacy so they're riding in
 
03:15:03.030 --> 03:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
two different bills and uh and and just
 
03:15:06.910 --> 03:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
reinstate precisely what this house
 
03:15:10.750 --> 03:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
approved you know last spring and get
 
03:15:13.670 --> 03:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
that to the floor and then let Finance
 
03:15:16.670 --> 03:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
have the luxury of another month to to
 
03:15:19.150 --> 03:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
run numbers and figure out uh you know
 
03:15:21.309 --> 03:15:21.319 align:start position:0%
what we can actually afford but but send
 
03:15:22.670 --> 03:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
it to them with two different effective
 
03:15:25.150 --> 03:15:25.160 align:start position:0%
dates so that we're on record as having
 
03:15:28.429 --> 03:15:28.439 align:start position:0%
made the commitment on on base adequacy
 
03:15:30.750 --> 03:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
and differentiated aid but we're
 
03:15:36.389 --> 03:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
allowing for um stepping in the funding
 
03:15:38.750 --> 03:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
commitment so I think that just takes
 
03:15:40.550 --> 03:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
all the ideas that I've been hearing and
 
03:15:48.910 --> 03:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:50.910 --> 03:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
plan well that's good because that
 
03:15:52.429 --> 03:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
narrows the
 
03:15:52.439 --> 03:16:01.870 align:start position:0%
narrows the
discussion

03:16:01.870 --> 03:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:04.710 --> 03:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
righty and it's
 
03:16:08.269 --> 03:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
not manufact money got we know what's in
 
03:16:10.910 --> 03:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
the account what would be in the account
 
03:16:16.229 --> 03:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
going into to 25 and we can use we can
 
03:16:20.309 --> 03:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
use a strong percentage of that
 
03:16:25.150 --> 03:16:25.160 align:start position:0%
um you know and then by Design during
 
03:16:27.630 --> 03:16:27.640 align:start position:0%
the next budget cycle
 
03:16:32.030 --> 03:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:35.030 --> 03:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
to can I ask Mark a
 
03:16:38.309 --> 03:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
question with regard to that Mark you
 
03:16:40.309 --> 03:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
send your notices out to school
 
03:16:42.910 --> 03:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
districts at what point for the
 
03:16:44.710 --> 03:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
following year when do they find out
 
03:16:46.429 --> 03:16:46.439 align:start position:0%
what how much what their allocation's
 
03:16:49.150 --> 03:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
going to be so most districts um are
 
03:16:52.429 --> 03:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
building their budget for fiscal year 25
 
03:16:54.590 --> 03:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
they received that Revenue estimate in
 
03:16:57.469 --> 03:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
November 15th so um a few months ago
 
03:16:59.309 --> 03:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
they received the revenue estimates from
 
03:17:01.070 --> 03:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
the state on how to build their 25
 
03:17:04.830 --> 03:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
budget if you amend fiscal year 25 um
 
03:17:06.150 --> 03:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
which has there's been it's been
 
03:17:08.550 --> 03:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
happening the past few years amending uh
 
03:17:11.110 --> 03:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
state law after the budgets local
 
03:17:13.150 --> 03:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
budgets have been passed um they can do
 
03:17:16.229 --> 03:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
a special district meeting to access
 
03:17:17.750 --> 03:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
that money for the appropriation
 
03:17:19.910 --> 03:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
purposes of spending on their schools or
 
03:17:22.030 --> 03:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
they can um if they do nothing it lapses
 
03:17:23.750 --> 03:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
to the taxpayers essentially it goes to
 
03:17:25.750 --> 03:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
reduce their tax liability um for the
 
03:17:30.269 --> 03:17:30.279 align:start position:0%
tax rates come December 2024 thank
 
03:17:33.990 --> 03:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
you or we can considered a similar
 
03:17:37.630 --> 03:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
Bill last week earli this
 
03:17:37.640 --> 03:17:41.189 align:start position:0%
Bill last week earli this
we

03:17:41.189 --> 03:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:41.199 --> 03:17:44.229 align:start position:0%
 
changes

03:17:44.229 --> 03:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:01.950 --> 03:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:05.189 --> 03:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
possibility represent cordelli yeah I I
 
03:18:07.389 --> 03:18:07.399 align:start position:0%
based on a couple of things I've heard
 
03:18:10.910 --> 03:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
um I I would hesitate on a
 
03:18:14.150 --> 03:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
onee um only fixed we've run into so
 
03:18:16.070 --> 03:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
many problems in the past when we do
 
03:18:19.429 --> 03:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
something for one year and then um the
 
03:18:22.389 --> 03:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
following year we get accused of cutting
 
03:18:24.910 --> 03:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
um school funding or whatever the case
 
03:18:29.750 --> 03:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
may be um two I'd like to see um a stay
 
03:18:31.590 --> 03:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
in the ballpark of what we were talking
 
03:18:34.189 --> 03:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
about this morning the 70
 
03:18:40.150 --> 03:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
million um and third um you know I would
 
03:18:43.349 --> 03:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
be just as happy I think not touching
 
03:18:48.030 --> 03:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
adequacy given the current court case um
 
03:18:50.550 --> 03:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
you know don't touch it and get you know
 
03:18:53.030 --> 03:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
are we sticking our fingers in the pie
 
03:18:59.030 --> 03:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:59.040 --> 03:19:01.189 align:start position:0%
 
adequacy

03:19:01.189 --> 03:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
03:19:03.990 --> 03:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I think I'd like to Echo
 
03:19:06.790 --> 03:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
that is I a onetime thing is easy to get
 
03:19:10.349 --> 03:19:10.359 align:start position:0%
used to and hard to get rid of and um I
 
03:19:12.150 --> 03:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
think we need to remember that we're at
 
03:19:15.469 --> 03:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
the very first step of a long process
 
03:19:17.349 --> 03:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
and so we don't have to work out all the
 
03:19:19.590 --> 03:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
details but we've got a general ballpark
 
03:19:21.309 --> 03:19:21.319 align:start position:0%
where we're headed and I like the
 
03:19:23.229 --> 03:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
direction that's going but I think that
 
03:19:24.670 --> 03:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
those of us in the education committee
 
03:19:26.510 --> 03:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
will be able to pick this up as soon as
 
03:19:27.830 --> 03:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
it gets to our
 
03:19:30.269 --> 03:19:30.279 align:start position:0%
committee to that end I think I think
 
03:19:32.189 --> 03:19:32.199 align:start position:0%
the second committee on this Ways and
 
03:19:34.309 --> 03:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
Means how are you going to fund it in
 
03:19:36.990 --> 03:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
the future it's obvious we can Finance
 
03:19:40.830 --> 03:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
can fund it in from the past so we're
 
03:19:44.030 --> 03:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
like a rubber stamp mhm I I really think
 
03:19:46.349 --> 03:19:46.359 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means is going to be on the hot
 
03:19:48.510 --> 03:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
seat if this is going to be an ongoing
 
03:19:53.389 --> 03:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:57.070 --> 03:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
from so before you go there dick dick
 
03:19:59.030 --> 03:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
before you go so are you recommending
 
03:20:01.590 --> 03:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
this be a one-time shot rather than no
 
03:20:02.950 --> 03:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
I'm recommending if we're going to make
 
03:20:04.469 --> 03:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
these changes they become permanent
 
03:20:06.389 --> 03:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
changes but then you got to figure out
 
03:20:07.910 --> 03:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
how you're going to pay for that that's
 
03:20:09.950 --> 03:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
my position as well you
 
03:20:13.590 --> 03:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
know and there is nothing worse when you
 
03:20:16.269 --> 03:20:16.279 align:start position:0%
go back to the school district and you
 
03:20:17.910 --> 03:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
start talking about what the budget's
 
03:20:19.110 --> 03:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
going to look like when you know the
 
03:20:21.269 --> 03:20:21.279 align:start position:0%
legislature just did a one-time thing
 
03:20:22.950 --> 03:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
and you have absolutely no idea where
 
03:20:25.189 --> 03:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to be next year and and I I
 
03:20:28.229 --> 03:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
hear from many uh uh people in the
 
03:20:32.830 --> 03:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
administration school board and um and
 
03:20:36.110 --> 03:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
constituents they won't reduce the
 
03:20:39.389 --> 03:20:39.399 align:start position:0%
property tax if they think it's only one
 
03:20:41.910 --> 03:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
year because they're then going to start
 
03:20:43.349 --> 03:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
start talking about what the ratchet
 
03:20:45.990 --> 03:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
effect looks like in year two we we saw
 
03:20:49.670 --> 03:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
that when we cut swep from 36 363
 
03:20:53.710 --> 03:20:53.720 align:start position:0%
million to 263 million how many um
 
03:20:55.990 --> 03:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers got a reduction in their tax
 
03:20:59.229 --> 03:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:03.349 --> 03:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
any you did we did
 
03:21:05.750 --> 03:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
did that's because Sean Jasper comes
 
03:21:05.760 --> 03:21:07.510 align:start position:0%
did that's because Sean Jasper comes
from

03:21:07.510 --> 03:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:21:10.990 --> 03:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
Huds and and when the when when the one
 
03:21:14.670 --> 03:21:14.680 align:start position:0%
shot is fiscal capacity disparity a and
 
03:21:17.110 --> 03:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
you're in a FIV Town district with five
 
03:21:18.830 --> 03:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
different demographics and five
 
03:21:22.790 --> 03:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
different uh uh consequences it is a
 
03:21:27.510 --> 03:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:30.830 --> 03:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
them so let let's get a motion on and
 
03:21:33.229 --> 03:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
take care of the part of this so far so
 
03:21:35.429 --> 03:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
we can take
 
03:21:40.469 --> 03:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
583 and amend 583 with those two
 
03:21:41.870 --> 03:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
components which we talked about the
 
03:21:44.349 --> 03:21:44.359 align:start position:0%
this morning the base cost going to 4404
 
03:21:48.990 --> 03:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
and the weighted amounts per four
 
03:21:50.870 --> 03:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
$444 by
 
03:21:55.030 --> 03:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
those um percentage increases and I
 
03:21:55.990 --> 03:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
don't have it right in front of me but
 
03:21:58.269 --> 03:21:58.279 align:start position:0%
it went like 0
 
03:22:05.630 --> 03:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:09.670 --> 03:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
category 1583 was the base cost
 
03:22:12.670 --> 03:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
yes yeah so we will increase
 
03:22:14.269 --> 03:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
increase from
 
03:22:19.349 --> 03:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:21.590 --> 03:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
4404 just everyone remember to put your
 
03:22:24.510 --> 03:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
keep your mics on because it'll be yeah
 
03:22:26.510 --> 03:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
yeah special education to the three
 
03:22:28.790 --> 03:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
categories per that per your sheet on
 
03:22:30.670 --> 03:22:30.680 align:start position:0%
the with the that's right and the
 
03:22:34.150 --> 03:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
category a is a
 
03:22:36.389 --> 03:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
05 no wait a minute that's that's the
 
03:22:38.590 --> 03:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
old sheet it's the one with a scribble
 
03:22:43.550 --> 03:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
on it yeah okay 6 1 point2 8 yes that
 
03:22:45.630 --> 03:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
sounds like it yeah because I doubled
 
03:22:48.710 --> 03:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
the six to 12 and then we went up
 
03:22:50.110 --> 03:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
another six to
 
03:22:53.110 --> 03:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
18 so that that would
 
03:22:58.070 --> 03:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:00.550 --> 03:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
1583 that's what we could recommend back
 
03:23:04.150 --> 03:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
to the um full body the policy now the
 
03:23:06.070 --> 03:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
ones that have to vote on then let's
 
03:23:07.950 --> 03:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
let's make sure we're we're because we
 
03:23:09.429 --> 03:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we got the effective
 
03:23:14.030 --> 03:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:18.150 --> 03:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
2024 I have no problems with that
 
03:23:23.389 --> 03:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:26.750 --> 03:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
effect so with that so we can get
 
03:23:28.950 --> 03:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
something done here the ones that can
 
03:23:32.349 --> 03:23:32.359 align:start position:0%
vote on that are those from
 
03:23:34.990 --> 03:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
the okay so we take caucus I have a
 
03:23:38.309 --> 03:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
quickly question yes so the special ed
 
03:23:41.389 --> 03:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
categories wouldn't wouldn't go to house
 
03:23:44.309 --> 03:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
build 1656 the one on special ed no
 
03:23:45.750 --> 03:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to use it for something else
 
03:23:51.590 --> 03:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:54.710 --> 03:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
it where you on that Glen huh where you
 
03:23:58.150 --> 03:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
on that on on this that that I would
 
03:23:59.670 --> 03:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
want to see if we're g to do something
 
03:24:02.070 --> 03:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
else on
 
03:24:10.590 --> 03:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:10.600 --> 03:38:48.469 align:start position:0%
 
mic

03:38:48.469 --> 03:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:52.790 --> 03:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
caucus I think I think we're on board
 
03:38:55.910 --> 03:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
with what you talked
 
03:39:00.670 --> 03:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
about uh going to a base of uh oh sorry
 
03:39:03.189 --> 03:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair uh I believe we're
 
03:39:06.150 --> 03:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
on board with what you talked about um
 
03:39:10.710 --> 03:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
just after lunch uh amending 1583 to to
 
03:39:13.590 --> 03:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
um to go to a a base of
 
03:39:16.590 --> 03:39:16.600 align:start position:0%
444 having the three special education
 
03:39:20.910 --> 03:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
categories weighted at6 1.2 1.8 and with
 
03:39:24.469 --> 03:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
an effective date of uh July 1st 2024
 
03:39:26.189 --> 03:39:26.199 align:start position:0%
and that total package would be about a
 
03:39:31.910 --> 03:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
$70 million um uh package we also would
 
03:39:37.349 --> 03:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
like to um to amend one of the um uh
 
03:39:41.110 --> 03:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
other bills possibly 1656 or or put it
 
03:39:42.309 --> 03:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
on top of
 
03:39:46.630 --> 03:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
1583 to um to uh add um a fiscal
 
03:39:49.550 --> 03:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity provision and I think
 
03:39:50.950 --> 03:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
we need to take a look at what the
 
03:39:53.510 --> 03:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
ranges are given what Mark has reported
 
03:39:55.590 --> 03:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
out on the significant changes in
 
03:39:59.189 --> 03:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
property valuation um but a fiscal dep
 
03:40:01.870 --> 03:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity package of $50
 
03:40:04.070 --> 03:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
million an enhanced free introduced
 
03:40:07.550 --> 03:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
price lunch package of $25 million also
 
03:40:10.269 --> 03:40:10.279 align:start position:0%
effective 71 2024 and that would be a
 
03:40:12.670 --> 03:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
$75 million package so altogether we're
 
03:40:12.680 --> 03:40:13.550 align:start position:0%
$75 million package so altogether we're
talking

03:40:13.550 --> 03:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
talking
 
03:40:18.429 --> 03:40:18.439 align:start position:0%
$45 uh million out of the um estimated U
 
03:40:21.910 --> 03:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh balance of the uh education trust
 
03:40:25.150 --> 03:40:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:27.950 --> 03:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
630 Al righty
 
03:40:30.510 --> 03:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
um I think you're too
 
03:40:34.429 --> 03:40:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:37.910 --> 03:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
it so so thank thank you I mean I think
 
03:40:37.920 --> 03:40:38.630 align:start position:0%
it so so thank thank you I mean I think
the

03:40:38.630 --> 03:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:40:42.309 --> 03:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
sustainability of uh of that obviously
 
03:40:44.830 --> 03:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
has a lot to do with the next budget
 
03:40:46.790 --> 03:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
cycle and there's a lot of things that I
 
03:40:49.950 --> 03:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
think go into you know the um the the
 
03:40:51.790 --> 03:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
budget cycle with respect to
 
03:40:55.790 --> 03:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
sustainability of all state operations
 
03:41:00.030 --> 03:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
so we had we had some discussion on this
 
03:41:03.630 --> 03:41:03.640 align:start position:0%
and I think maybe to a little bit too
 
03:41:06.750 --> 03:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
rich here but where where we are I think
 
03:41:09.229 --> 03:41:09.239 align:start position:0%
there's concurrence and agreement
 
03:41:10.950 --> 03:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
regarding the special education
 
03:41:13.469 --> 03:41:13.479 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid I think everybody's
 
03:41:15.510 --> 03:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
on board with increasing that at the
 
03:41:18.550 --> 03:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
03:41:21.510 --> 03:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh5 I'm trying to read the which sheet
 
03:41:24.630 --> 03:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
it's got buried here 35 million a little
 
03:41:25.950 --> 03:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
over $35
 
03:41:29.290 --> 03:41:29.300 align:start position:0%
million um and
 
03:41:29.300 --> 03:41:31.309 align:start position:0%
million um and
[Music]

03:41:31.309 --> 03:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:41:37.750 --> 03:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
to consider also in the fiscal capacity
 
03:41:41.070 --> 03:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
disparity or fiscal cap in and what bill
 
03:41:46.229 --> 03:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:50.110 --> 03:41:50.120 align:start position:0%
million in House Bill Bill two we had
 
03:41:52.189 --> 03:41:52.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity Aid in the
 
03:41:56.870 --> 03:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
amount of 39 in it we'd like to see that
 
03:42:00.309 --> 03:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
side of the formula done effective July
 
03:42:04.550 --> 03:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
1 2024 and the uh area de with special
 
03:42:07.590 --> 03:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
education totaling up you know about 74
 
03:42:10.550 --> 03:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
million and then writing in that
 
03:42:12.189 --> 03:42:12.199 align:start position:0%
effective at
 
03:42:14.110 --> 03:42:14.120 align:start position:0%
the you
 
03:42:18.349 --> 03:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
know what was be July 1
 
03:42:22.950 --> 03:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
2025 that the amount of 4404 would be
 
03:42:22.960 --> 03:42:31.469 align:start position:0%
2025 that the amount of 4404 would be
the

03:42:31.469 --> 03:42:31.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:31.479 --> 03:42:32.990 align:start position:0%
 
base

03:42:32.990 --> 03:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
base
 
03:42:37.349 --> 03:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
Sugg the base for fy2 they should stay
 
03:42:37.359 --> 03:42:38.670 align:start position:0%
Sugg the base for fy2 they should stay
the

03:42:38.670 --> 03:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:42:41.149 --> 03:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
same and I I'll just give you a little
 
03:42:43.389 --> 03:42:43.399 align:start position:0%
more information on that and leaving the
 
03:42:46.870 --> 03:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
special education money set the way
 
03:42:48.910 --> 03:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
we've got it on paper right here that
 
03:42:52.389 --> 03:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
was develop developed off
 
03:42:56.030 --> 03:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
4444 leave that and and just have that
 
03:42:58.189 --> 03:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
you know inclusive in that amounts for
 
03:43:01.630 --> 03:43:01.640 align:start position:0%
each weighted the dollar the dollars and
 
03:43:04.349 --> 03:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
to put the
 
03:43:08.269 --> 03:43:08.279 align:start position:0%
4,44 base cost and increment over the
 
03:43:11.269 --> 03:43:11.279 align:start position:0%
4,100 plus we have right now to start in
 
03:43:12.990 --> 03:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
July 1
 
03:43:15.950 --> 03:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
125 and the fiscal capacity which would
 
03:43:18.309 --> 03:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
be the 39 billion million that we took
 
03:43:26.910 --> 03:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:26.920 --> 03:43:28.469 align:start position:0%
 
2024

03:43:28.469 --> 03:43:28.479 align:start position:0%
2024
 
03:43:31.309 --> 03:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
starting that's that's where we what did
 
03:43:34.670 --> 03:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
you have again for the for the right
 
03:43:38.870 --> 03:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:42.550 --> 03:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
39 on which of the two components fiscal
 
03:43:44.790 --> 03:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
disparity a so that would be
 
03:43:49.550 --> 03:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
39 million and then anything on pre
 
03:43:53.269 --> 03:43:53.279 align:start position:0%
no so would be 74 million effective
 
03:43:56.670 --> 03:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
21 uh
 
03:43:59.670 --> 03:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
7124 and then the base adequacy for
 
03:44:04.070 --> 03:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:06.590 --> 03:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
7125 Mr chair is it possible to have
 
03:44:11.429 --> 03:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
Mark run what we
 
03:44:11.439 --> 03:44:13.149 align:start position:0%
Mark run what we
so

03:44:13.149 --> 03:44:13.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:16.309 --> 03:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
number the policy that's been used with
 
03:44:18.990 --> 03:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
capacity is you're always going to aim
 
03:44:21.309 --> 03:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
for not know if it's average or median
 
03:44:23.910 --> 03:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
but it's going to it's going to start at
 
03:44:26.110 --> 03:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
the floor so who's ever got the lowest
 
03:44:27.070 --> 03:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
this is
 
03:44:31.110 --> 03:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:33.510 --> 03:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
follow the highest rant award is always
 
03:44:35.269 --> 03:44:35.279 align:start position:0%
going to go to the community generally
 
03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
with the lowest EV and then it's going
 
03:44:41.830 --> 03:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
to slowly pH out you the average and so
 
03:44:43.229 --> 03:44:43.239 align:start position:0%
give or take move the numbers around a
 
03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
little bit um if you tell me you want to
 
03:44:50.349 --> 03:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
spend 39 million I can essentially say
 
03:44:51.870 --> 03:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
okay well then how would I distribute
 
03:44:53.630 --> 03:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
that in a way where that the community
 
03:44:55.429 --> 03:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
that has the lowest tax base gets the
 
03:44:57.510 --> 03:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
biggest brand award and the community
 
03:45:01.030 --> 03:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
with the median median gets essentially
 
03:45:03.550 --> 03:45:03.560 align:start position:0%
zero or you small amount of dollars
 
03:45:07.070 --> 03:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
right that's what we've done yeah
 
03:45:10.349 --> 03:45:10.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's so we got to
 
03:45:14.269 --> 03:45:14.279 align:start position:0%
move here on on this are are is that
 
03:45:17.630 --> 03:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
good with y'all um no I think I think
 
03:45:19.950 --> 03:45:19.960 align:start position:0%
we're interested in putting forth our
 
03:45:24.030 --> 03:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:24.040 --> 03:45:26.229 align:start position:0%
 
amendments

03:45:26.229 --> 03:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
03:45:29.910 --> 03:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
can can you pro pro present both options
 
03:45:36.750 --> 03:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:38.830 --> 03:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
committee one thing I hate to see it
 
03:45:40.830 --> 03:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
come out 10 10 and the education
 
03:45:43.269 --> 03:45:43.279 align:start position:0%
committee because then we get this big
 
03:45:46.389 --> 03:45:46.399 align:start position:0%
issue on the floor be good if we can get
 
03:45:48.030 --> 03:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
this to our second
 
03:45:50.910 --> 03:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
committee without a whole lot of
 
03:45:53.630 --> 03:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
hassle then because it's going to have
 
03:45:55.950 --> 03:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
to come back to the house floor so yeah
 
03:45:57.950 --> 03:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
then could could we do this could we
 
03:46:00.910 --> 03:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
could we put the two um the two versions
 
03:46:03.830 --> 03:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
of the these could all be on
 
03:46:05.750 --> 03:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
one using
 
03:46:08.590 --> 03:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
1583 right
 
03:46:13.389 --> 03:46:13.399 align:start position:0%
sure for your version of a 53 am 1583
 
03:46:17.149 --> 03:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:19.149 --> 03:46:19.159 align:start position:0%
version get those get those two
 
03:46:21.590 --> 03:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
amendments on top of
 
03:46:26.349 --> 03:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
1583 and and have the note Department
 
03:46:26.359 --> 03:46:28.710 align:start position:0%
1583 and and have the note Department
generated

03:46:28.710 --> 03:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
generated
 
03:46:31.670 --> 03:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
you for that and then and then take it
 
03:46:34.030 --> 03:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
to committee it
 
03:46:36.389 --> 03:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
around agree it would be great to have
 
03:46:40.750 --> 03:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
committee rally around one of those
 
03:46:43.269 --> 03:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
and then and then uh interim study the
 
03:46:46.269 --> 03:46:46.279 align:start position:0%
other three bills well we interim study
 
03:46:48.590 --> 03:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
that we haven't discussed the we that
 
03:46:50.710 --> 03:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
tall yeah
 
03:46:53.990 --> 03:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
yeah certainly the other the other right
 
03:46:57.070 --> 03:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
yeah but I I want to make real clear
 
03:46:59.750 --> 03:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
here this we they' said this is a
 
03:47:03.750 --> 03:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid it's a continued
 
03:47:08.469 --> 03:47:08.479 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid 1586 looks at a total look it's
 
03:47:10.469 --> 03:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
really a restructure
 
03:47:14.870 --> 03:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
of how we fund schools and I want a
 
03:47:18.229 --> 03:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
commitment a commitment to look at this
 
03:47:20.550 --> 03:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
seriously it's been four years since we
 
03:47:22.189 --> 03:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
put this forward the first year we
 
03:47:23.750 --> 03:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't even get anybody talking about
 
03:47:26.110 --> 03:47:26.120 align:start position:0%
it and frankly probably the reason why
 
03:47:27.269 --> 03:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
we're talking about it now is because of
 
03:47:29.630 --> 03:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
a damn court
 
03:47:31.830 --> 03:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
case so I'm not going to leave this
 
03:47:33.750 --> 03:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
committee until there's a there's a damn
 
03:47:37.110 --> 03:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
commitment I'm sorry calm down sorry
 
03:47:39.950 --> 03:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
GL that we that we are committed that
 
03:47:41.389 --> 03:47:41.399 align:start position:0%
over the summertime that we're going to
 
03:47:44.710 --> 03:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
look at 1586 in a serious way so that by
 
03:47:47.189 --> 03:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
the time we come to create a new budget
 
03:47:49.830 --> 03:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
next time we at least have got something
 
03:47:52.510 --> 03:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
that that hopefully is going to address
 
03:47:54.309 --> 03:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
and by that time we should know what the
 
03:47:57.830 --> 03:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
Court's going to say eta so so I guess
 
03:48:00.349 --> 03:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'm asking a commitment on your
 
03:48:03.630 --> 03:48:03.640 align:start position:0%
part to continue a serious C study of
 
03:48:05.910 --> 03:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
this if we in fact put this in interim
 
03:48:09.590 --> 03:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
study 1586 in the interim study if if we
 
03:48:11.870 --> 03:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
have an interim study I would hope that
 
03:48:13.870 --> 03:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
we could have the same
 
03:48:16.990 --> 03:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
composition and and uh have a serious
 
03:48:18.950 --> 03:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
look yes I would I'm not going to
 
03:48:21.309 --> 03:48:21.319 align:start position:0%
guarantee that any Bill comes out the
 
03:48:23.349 --> 03:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
way we're looking at it you know that's
 
03:48:24.630 --> 03:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
that's up to the committee and keep and
 
03:48:27.469 --> 03:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
keep this group together as many as that
 
03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:41.630 --> 03:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
it mean I have to change my Alaska bit
 
03:48:43.269 --> 03:48:43.279 align:start position:0%
is it this
 
03:48:46.389 --> 03:48:46.399 align:start position:0%
summer go in August go in August that's
 
03:48:48.750 --> 03:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
a rainy season if there's awful up there
 
03:48:51.510 --> 03:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
June's the best season to visit Alaska
 
03:48:54.710 --> 03:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
um yeah but I yes I would I'm certainly
 
03:48:58.870 --> 03:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:02.309 --> 03:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
but you you you're you still you're
 
03:49:03.870 --> 03:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
You're Going For
 
03:49:07.550 --> 03:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
What 100 145
 
03:49:11.510 --> 03:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
145 see we're we're we're going for 74
 
03:49:19.269 --> 03:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:19.279 --> 03:49:21.790 align:start position:0%
 
there

03:49:21.790 --> 03:49:21.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:49:25.510 --> 03:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
yes can you explain to me why only 70
 
03:49:29.070 --> 03:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
and not 145 if the money we're talking
 
03:49:31.870 --> 03:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
about the money that's budgeted in the
 
03:49:33.630 --> 03:49:33.640 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
correct yeah this 14 145
 
03:49:42.469 --> 03:49:42.479 align:start position:0%
million why wouldn't we want to expend
 
03:49:44.910 --> 03:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
that let the finance people maybe
 
03:49:44.920 --> 03:49:46.389 align:start position:0%
that let the finance people maybe
somebody

03:49:46.389 --> 03:49:46.399 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
03:49:48.790 --> 03:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
can you can only spend it
 
03:49:52.110 --> 03:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
once you don't you don't have
 
03:49:52.120 --> 03:49:53.710 align:start position:0%
once you don't you don't have
145

03:49:53.710 --> 03:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
145
 
03:49:56.110 --> 03:49:56.120 align:start position:0%
endlessly so it goes to Ways and Means
 
03:49:59.910 --> 03:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
and say you got another 145 and they say
 
03:50:01.710 --> 03:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
yay nay whatever we're going to have to
 
03:50:03.790 --> 03:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
do this and that something else and they
 
03:50:06.429 --> 03:50:06.439 align:start position:0%
can say no we
 
03:50:09.870 --> 03:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
don't the difference the delta right now
 
03:50:11.550 --> 03:50:11.560 align:start position:0%
and the education trust fund is about
 
03:50:13.510 --> 03:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
$40 million a
 
03:50:17.710 --> 03:50:17.720 align:start position:0%
year all right so we're suggesting
 
03:50:21.550 --> 03:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
spending 70 ongoing which is greater
 
03:50:23.389 --> 03:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
than the 40 so now we go look at Ways
 
03:50:24.590 --> 03:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
and Means and say we got to come up
 
03:50:27.910 --> 03:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
under the 30 you're proposing to say you
 
03:50:29.790 --> 03:50:29.800 align:start position:0%
got to come up with another hund
 
03:50:33.550 --> 03:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
whatever I I don't know what the math is
 
03:50:36.149 --> 03:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
well yeah that's right sure but we're
 
03:50:38.870 --> 03:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
only looking at one one one side of it
 
03:50:41.070 --> 03:50:41.080 align:start position:0%
right now the education trust fund the
 
03:50:44.269 --> 03:50:44.279 align:start position:0%
general fund is the um you know is the
 
03:50:46.309 --> 03:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
the big enchilada and what is the
 
03:50:48.469 --> 03:50:48.479 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement look like for the for
 
03:50:49.950 --> 03:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
the general
 
03:50:54.110 --> 03:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
fund right now I think it's uh over 250
 
03:50:57.309 --> 03:50:57.319 align:start position:0%
yeah so so the general fund is is is
 
03:51:01.309 --> 03:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
generating revenues over over plan over
 
03:51:04.510 --> 03:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
plan yes so
 
03:51:07.670 --> 03:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
so that certainly seems like it would be
 
03:51:09.429 --> 03:51:09.439 align:start position:0%
enough to cover I mean we're we're we're
 
03:51:12.670 --> 03:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
talking about $75 million difference
 
03:51:14.870 --> 03:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
right in what you're B yeah so the the
 
03:51:18.349 --> 03:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
general fund is is generating surpluses
 
03:51:21.830 --> 03:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
well ahead of what we're suggesting to
 
03:51:24.630 --> 03:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
be used for Education which in the in
 
03:51:24.640 --> 03:51:25.630 align:start position:0%
be used for Education which in the in
the

03:51:25.630 --> 03:51:25.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:51:28.510 --> 03:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
state's discretionary spend is the
 
03:51:31.710 --> 03:51:31.720 align:start position:0%
biggest portion of the of the of its
 
03:51:33.550 --> 03:51:33.560 align:start position:0%
discretionary I just want to say that
 
03:51:35.229 --> 03:51:35.239 align:start position:0%
when we make a commitment we have to do
 
03:51:36.910 --> 03:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
it for school districts we can't tell
 
03:51:39.630 --> 03:51:39.640 align:start position:0%
them they're going to get XYZ and then
 
03:51:41.790 --> 03:51:41.800 align:start position:0%
have to reneg on that it's not feir to
 
03:51:43.830 --> 03:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers it's not feir to school
 
03:51:46.189 --> 03:51:46.199 align:start position:0%
districts they do their budgets almost a
 
03:51:48.309 --> 03:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
year ahead so we've got to this is a
 
03:51:50.229 --> 03:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
commitment and a promise and we can't
 
03:51:52.110 --> 03:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
defer from
 
03:51:54.429 --> 03:51:54.439 align:start position:0%
that Mr
 
03:51:56.870 --> 03:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
chairman we're talking about virtually
 
03:51:58.870 --> 03:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
the same package and virtually the same
 
03:52:01.189 --> 03:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
numbers and the difference is how we
 
03:52:05.630 --> 03:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
phase it in and we heard a difference uh
 
03:52:09.389 --> 03:52:09.399 align:start position:0%
in in posture earlier is it a one shot
 
03:52:10.670 --> 03:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
is that a
 
03:52:14.389 --> 03:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid I'd like to make this a
 
03:52:16.469 --> 03:52:16.479 align:start position:0%
commitment that is not a oneshot and
 
03:52:19.469 --> 03:52:19.479 align:start position:0%
it's not just a Band-Aid it's a first
 
03:52:22.269 --> 03:52:22.279 align:start position:0%
step towards and I think yeah I would
 
03:52:24.790 --> 03:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
like to certainly be on record that I
 
03:52:29.630 --> 03:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
hope any vote to put 1586 in interim
 
03:52:33.750 --> 03:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
study is a sincere effort to prepare uh
 
03:52:35.590 --> 03:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature for
 
03:52:40.910 --> 03:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
2025 um budget cycle okay so in that
 
03:52:42.910 --> 03:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
context I think since we're saying
 
03:52:45.149 --> 03:52:45.159 align:start position:0%
virtually the same thing and and you're
 
03:52:47.429 --> 03:52:47.439 align:start position:0%
hearing input from ways and means we
 
03:52:49.550 --> 03:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
don't have a vote and
 
03:52:52.269 --> 03:52:52.279 align:start position:0%
finance uh that the best way to get this
 
03:52:57.349 --> 03:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
done is to stagger uh this is the spirit
 
03:53:01.110 --> 03:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
and the purpose of the uh the way that
 
03:53:03.510 --> 03:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative Vlad laid it out to do
 
03:53:06.750 --> 03:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
the things that you want to do in two
 
03:53:09.510 --> 03:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
steps and then stick with it
 
03:53:12.630 --> 03:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
and work on 1586 and I think if you look
 
03:53:16.389 --> 03:53:16.399 align:start position:0%
at it like that holistically it makes
 
03:53:19.189 --> 03:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
sense I
 
03:53:22.910 --> 03:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate I appreciate that schools um
 
03:53:25.349 --> 03:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
I I just think when we when we take a
 
03:53:28.870 --> 03:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
look at the um
 
03:53:31.990 --> 03:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
the the changes that that you got that
 
03:53:35.269 --> 03:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
you're proposing to make and introduce
 
03:53:37.870 --> 03:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
uh for fy2 and the changes we're
 
03:53:40.950 --> 03:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
proposing to to make and introduce for
 
03:53:40.960 --> 03:53:42.590 align:start position:0%
proposing to to make and introduce for
FY

03:53:42.590 --> 03:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
FY
 
03:53:47.030 --> 03:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
25 not just not just the the the the
 
03:53:50.389 --> 03:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
total dollar but the effect that it has
 
03:53:53.950 --> 03:53:53.960 align:start position:0%
on school on on on on so many more
 
03:53:56.429 --> 03:53:56.439 align:start position:0%
school districts in a in a meaningful
 
03:53:58.870 --> 03:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
full way is going to be really important
 
03:54:00.830 --> 03:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
because I agree I think we're we're not
 
03:54:04.349 --> 03:54:04.359 align:start position:0%
that far off in our in our general scope
 
03:54:06.710 --> 03:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
on this but but if we were to get from
 
03:54:09.269 --> 03:54:09.279 align:start position:0%
the Department um to see what the
 
03:54:12.469 --> 03:54:12.479 align:start position:0%
difference is and see what that means I
 
03:54:15.229 --> 03:54:15.239 align:start position:0%
mean the the you know I I think we're
 
03:54:18.590 --> 03:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
talking about good changes for special
 
03:54:22.229 --> 03:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
education uh and and a good change to
 
03:54:25.750 --> 03:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
the to the base as well but those two
 
03:54:28.630 --> 03:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
changes don't do anything you know more
 
03:54:31.110 --> 03:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
for um Newport than they do for
 
03:54:34.309 --> 03:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
Newcastle and when we look at the other
 
03:54:36.110 --> 03:54:36.120 align:start position:0%
things that we're proposing we're
 
03:54:37.590 --> 03:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
talking about things that are going to
 
03:54:39.870 --> 03:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
do a lot for Newport and a lot for
 
03:54:42.269 --> 03:54:42.279 align:start position:0%
Claremont and Berlin and a lot of the
 
03:54:44.389 --> 03:54:44.399 align:start position:0%
other towns that have have really been
 
03:54:48.389 --> 03:54:48.399 align:start position:0%
suffering for the last 30 plus years um
 
03:54:50.750 --> 03:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh in this and it's not a solution it's
 
03:54:52.710 --> 03:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
a Band-Aid because everything on the
 
03:54:55.590 --> 03:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
right hand side is to fix everything
 
03:54:57.630 --> 03:54:57.640 align:start position:0%
that's broken or things that are broken
 
03:55:00.189 --> 03:55:00.199 align:start position:0%
on the leftand side of the formula and
 
03:55:03.510 --> 03:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
one of the real positives around 1586
 
03:55:05.630 --> 03:55:05.640 align:start position:0%
and I think 1586 can be shuffled around
 
03:55:07.550 --> 03:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of different ways and Dick been
 
03:55:09.309 --> 03:55:09.319 align:start position:0%
just in the last week been looking at a
 
03:55:12.189 --> 03:55:12.199 align:start position:0%
couple of couple of of significant
 
03:55:15.710 --> 03:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
changes to that can be done in a way
 
03:55:18.229 --> 03:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
where it's a strong adequacy formula
 
03:55:21.510 --> 03:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't require to be propped up
 
03:55:25.630 --> 03:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
with a bunch of rightand side you know
 
03:55:29.030 --> 03:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
bandages and braces and everything else
 
03:55:32.670 --> 03:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
um so I i' I'd like to I'd like to see
 
03:55:36.950 --> 03:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
us proceed with with the two amendments
 
03:55:40.349 --> 03:55:40.359 align:start position:0%
um in in in in a form enough that that
 
03:55:43.389 --> 03:55:43.399 align:start position:0%
the department could could could run
 
03:55:46.830 --> 03:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
some numbers and then maybe as a group
 
03:55:49.710 --> 03:55:49.720 align:start position:0%
we can we could reconvene you know it
 
03:55:51.309 --> 03:55:51.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be for four hours on a
 
03:55:53.469 --> 03:55:53.479 align:start position:0%
Friday maybe it's for a half hour you
 
03:55:55.389 --> 03:55:55.399 align:start position:0%
know when when all of our committees are
 
03:55:56.910 --> 03:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
meeting or something like that or maybe
 
03:55:59.070 --> 03:55:59.080 align:start position:0%
it is I think the next two Fridays we
 
03:56:00.550 --> 03:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
don't have task
 
03:56:03.469 --> 03:56:03.479 align:start position:0%
force I mean High Ed yeah yeah we don't
 
03:56:05.429 --> 03:56:05.439 align:start position:0%
have highered task force so and I know
 
03:56:08.309 --> 03:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
we got to be out and done by the uh by
 
03:56:11.590 --> 03:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
the thir 13th we're going to exec these
 
03:56:16.309 --> 03:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
so um but you know to to so that so that
 
03:56:19.189 --> 03:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
at least we're looking eyes wide open at
 
03:56:26.510 --> 03:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:29.429 --> 03:56:29.439 align:start position:0%
means well I I think what we've got to
 
03:56:31.990 --> 03:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
do is just have another short caucus we
 
03:56:33.469 --> 03:56:33.479 align:start position:0%
have we have not really coau we wer in
 
03:56:33.479 --> 03:56:34.910 align:start position:0%
have we have not really coau we wer in
here

03:56:34.910 --> 03:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:56:37.510 --> 03:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
discussing so why don't we take a moment
 
03:56:39.469 --> 03:56:39.479 align:start position:0%
or two and do that and so we need to
 
03:56:41.389 --> 03:56:41.399 align:start position:0%
clear the room out of everybody but
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:07.600 --> 04:02:07.149 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:02:07.149 --> 04:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:07.159 --> 04:11:27.469 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:11:27.469 --> 04:11:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:31.349 --> 04:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh let me explain what uh we'd like to
 
04:11:34.630 --> 04:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
do um we would like to I think we have
 
04:11:36.710 --> 04:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
General consensus from everybody here
 
04:11:38.630 --> 04:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
that about the special
 
04:11:41.149 --> 04:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
education so we think it's probably
 
04:11:42.630 --> 04:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate that we put the special
 
04:11:46.469 --> 04:11:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:49.149 --> 04:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
1656 and it would be as it's been
 
04:11:52.149 --> 04:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
presented to us earlier this morning the
 
04:11:56.030 --> 04:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
based on the 4404 and the weighted
 
04:11:59.149 --> 04:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
factors of uh
 
04:12:01.429 --> 04:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
6 um
 
04:12:03.510 --> 04:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
1.2 and
 
04:12:07.309 --> 04:12:07.319 align:start position:0%
1.8 so that's one the other other way
 
04:12:11.269 --> 04:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
would like to do is to take the bill
 
04:12:12.750 --> 04:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
which is the
 
04:12:15.750 --> 04:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
1583 that's the one dealing with the uh
 
04:12:17.590 --> 04:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
the base and it opportunity for an
 
04:12:17.600 --> 04:12:19.189 align:start position:0%
the base and it opportunity for an
adequate

04:12:19.189 --> 04:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
04:12:22.429 --> 04:12:22.439 align:start position:0%
education and also adding on that by way
 
04:12:24.750 --> 04:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
of an amendment uh amending it to
 
04:12:27.349 --> 04:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
include fiscal capacity disparity
 
04:12:30.429 --> 04:12:30.439 align:start position:0%
Aid in the amount you know we really
 
04:12:32.550 --> 04:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
didn't talk numbers but basing upon what
 
04:12:35.710 --> 04:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
we heard the $39 million putting that on
 
04:12:39.990 --> 04:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
that and also Al having the 4404 as the
 
04:12:44.590 --> 04:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
base on it and have the deadline for uh
 
04:12:46.950 --> 04:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
implementation on the fiscal capacity
 
04:12:51.030 --> 04:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
disparity date as uh 1 July
 
04:12:53.269 --> 04:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
2024 and
 
04:12:57.269 --> 04:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
the implementation of the base cost at 1
 
04:12:57.279 --> 04:13:06.149 align:start position:0%
the implementation of the base cost at 1
July

04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:06.159 --> 04:13:08.429 align:start position:0%
 
2025

04:13:08.429 --> 04:13:08.439 align:start position:0%
2025
 
04:13:11.309 --> 04:13:11.319 align:start position:0%
okay so you got the special ed one right
 
04:13:15.389 --> 04:13:15.399 align:start position:0%
special separate number
 
04:13:18.590 --> 04:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
1656 and that is the bill which came
 
04:13:21.710 --> 04:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
about special ed that is the bill and
 
04:13:24.830 --> 04:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
then we want to take 1583 that's the one
 
04:13:28.070 --> 04:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
that um deals with the base cost we
 
04:13:31.189 --> 04:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
would like to also put into that bill uh
 
04:13:34.349 --> 04:13:34.359 align:start position:0%
the issue that we feel that the right
 
04:13:36.030 --> 04:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
hand side of the column has to be looked
 
04:13:37.710 --> 04:13:37.720 align:start position:0%
at with fiscal capacity capacity
 
04:13:41.550 --> 04:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid as was reflected in
 
04:13:45.870 --> 04:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
hb2 and that's a $39 million
 
04:13:48.870 --> 04:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
tab stays on the left hand side on the
 
04:13:53.109 --> 04:13:53.119 align:start position:0%
right hand side right hand side and then
 
04:13:56.910 --> 04:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
effective that would be effective July 1
 
04:13:59.469 --> 04:13:59.479 align:start position:0%
2024 we'd have two effective dates
 
04:14:02.870 --> 04:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
within that bill the the second part of
 
04:14:05.269 --> 04:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
the bill would be the increase the base
 
04:14:09.149 --> 04:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
cost to 4,44 and that would be effective
 
04:14:13.309 --> 04:14:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:16.349 --> 04:14:16.359 align:start position:0%
2025 so for for what I'm hearing and I I
 
04:14:19.469 --> 04:14:19.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh that very much um uh I
 
04:14:22.229 --> 04:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
think we're close I think um i' I'd
 
04:14:25.550 --> 04:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
still like to see us create um two you
 
04:14:27.910 --> 04:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
know two amendments on on each of these
 
04:14:30.109 --> 04:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
bills and I think we can we can
 
04:14:31.990 --> 04:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
structure them the same way that you're
 
04:14:34.469 --> 04:14:34.479 align:start position:0%
talking about so that we would have an
 
04:14:36.910 --> 04:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
amendment to well we we actually we both
 
04:14:42.910 --> 04:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
be be full agreement on on 1656 15 1656
 
04:14:44.429 --> 04:14:44.439 align:start position:0%
we're both we're all on the same page on
 
04:14:47.269 --> 04:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
that and then an amendment on
 
04:14:50.109 --> 04:14:50.119 align:start position:0%
1583 I think we would like to see a base
 
04:14:50.119 --> 04:14:51.109 align:start position:0%
1583 I think we would like to see a base
of

04:14:51.109 --> 04:14:51.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:14:55.910 --> 04:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
4404 and a fiscal capacity disparity U
 
04:14:59.389 --> 04:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
Aid of 50 million and an effect and an
 
04:15:01.109 --> 04:15:01.119 align:start position:0%
enhanced free underdose Price lunch of
 
04:15:04.469 --> 04:15:04.479 align:start position:0%
25 uh million all effective
 
04:15:07.630 --> 04:15:07.640 align:start position:0%
7124 which was the 25 million that was
 
04:15:09.309 --> 04:15:09.319 align:start position:0%
the enhanced free this is what we'
 
04:15:12.429 --> 04:15:12.439 align:start position:0%
worked on together on House Bill 529 so
 
04:15:14.429 --> 04:15:14.439 align:start position:0%
start over around 1583 want have I
 
04:15:15.670 --> 04:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't writing now I thought I knew
 
04:15:17.349 --> 04:15:17.359 align:start position:0%
where you're going you you strayed on of
 
04:15:19.870 --> 04:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
me so no we were fiscal capacity
 
04:15:22.750 --> 04:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid of 50 million yeah 50
 
04:15:24.189 --> 04:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
million and then the free and reduced
 
04:15:24.199 --> 04:15:25.269 align:start position:0%
million and then the free and reduced
price

04:15:25.269 --> 04:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
price
 
04:15:29.309 --> 04:15:29.319 align:start position:0%
lunch U additional Grant of 25 million
 
04:15:31.070 --> 04:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
so that's the $75
 
04:15:33.670 --> 04:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
million Equity
 
04:15:37.710 --> 04:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
package and having both those um
 
04:15:41.030 --> 04:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
ring in on 7124 I mean you've got you've
 
04:15:43.990 --> 04:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
got a $40 million fiscal capacity
 
04:15:47.830 --> 04:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid 39 million on 7124 so
 
04:15:49.790 --> 04:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
we're fairly close on that we're
 
04:15:55.830 --> 04:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:59.710 --> 04:15:59.720 align:start position:0%
million I think if is that going to
 
04:16:00.950 --> 04:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
appear in the bill is that going to f in
 
04:16:04.870 --> 04:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
the fisc note just just the policy
 
04:16:08.070 --> 04:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
going um no the the the the policy would
 
04:16:10.429 --> 04:16:10.439 align:start position:0%
be there would be two
 
04:16:12.630 --> 04:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
amendments no but I'm saying are put the
 
04:16:15.149 --> 04:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
dollars in the bill or
 
04:16:19.269 --> 04:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
just the policy and let fiscal note
 
04:16:21.070 --> 04:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
cover the dollars the fiscal note would
 
04:16:22.269 --> 04:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
cover the dollars because it's coming
 
04:16:24.590 --> 04:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
out of the education trust fund uh we we
 
04:16:27.550 --> 04:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
don't have to generate cash uh for this
 
04:16:30.229 --> 04:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
year because because we've got it but
 
04:16:31.710 --> 04:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
but it would be incumbent during the
 
04:16:33.830 --> 04:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
budget process of next year if the
 
04:16:35.469 --> 04:16:35.479 align:start position:0%
policy was to remain we wouldn't have
 
04:16:38.109 --> 04:16:38.119 align:start position:0%
the policy sunset but if the policy was
 
04:16:40.309 --> 04:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
to remain the same then it would be up
 
04:16:43.910 --> 04:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
to to budget next year to make sure that
 
04:16:46.990 --> 04:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
or or change the policy so so is this is
 
04:16:48.790 --> 04:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
this a commitment though to continue
 
04:16:48.800 --> 04:16:57.510 align:start position:0%
this a commitment though to continue
this

04:16:57.510 --> 04:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:01.070 --> 04:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
yes so exactly what type of dollar sign
 
04:17:03.670 --> 04:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
are you looking for for going effective
 
04:17:09.750 --> 04:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
July 1 2024 it would be 9 million 145
 
04:17:12.389 --> 04:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
million oh okay and you're at you're at
 
04:17:14.630 --> 04:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
because you you're subtracting out 35
 
04:17:17.469 --> 04:17:17.479 align:start position:0%
though for the special
 
04:17:21.870 --> 04:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
ed uh no we oh oh sure yeah yeah so
 
04:17:23.670 --> 04:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
we're both agreeing on the special ad
 
04:17:26.469 --> 04:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
right yeah so yeah so
 
04:17:31.870 --> 04:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah yeah so 110 109 110 million
 
04:17:36.349 --> 04:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
um and you're so we're at that for the
 
04:17:41.109 --> 04:17:41.119 align:start position:0%
for that one and you're at at um 39 plus
 
04:17:44.750 --> 04:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
whatever the whatever the 4404 costs
 
04:17:44.760 --> 04:17:45.630 align:start position:0%
whatever the whatever the 4404 costs
beginning

04:17:45.630 --> 04:17:45.640 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
04:17:45.640 --> 04:17:48.229 align:start position:0%
beginning
7125

04:17:48.229 --> 04:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
7125
 
04:17:51.070 --> 04:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
correct which is which is6 million for
 
04:17:51.080 --> 04:17:53.309 align:start position:0%
correct which is which is6 million for
every

04:17:53.309 --> 04:17:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:55.469 --> 04:17:55.479 align:start position:0%
$100 right so it's
 
04:18:00.469 --> 04:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
$300 so that's that's 45 Mill U 45
 
04:18:04.109 --> 04:18:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:08.469 --> 04:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
that let me get this straight because
 
04:18:10.830 --> 04:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
on the second Bill we're talking about
 
04:18:13.030 --> 04:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking
 
04:18:16.229 --> 04:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
about putting in you're talking about
 
04:18:18.389 --> 04:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
the base right we're we're talking and
 
04:18:21.790 --> 04:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
that is 34 million that's 34 million
 
04:18:24.030 --> 04:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and then we're talking
 
04:18:27.149 --> 04:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
about you said
 
04:18:30.269 --> 04:18:30.279 align:start position:0%
fnr so talking about base of 34 million
 
04:18:33.550 --> 04:18:33.560 align:start position:0%
that's base of 4404 yeah it's 34 million
 
04:18:36.269 --> 04:18:36.279 align:start position:0%
plus fiscal capacity disparity Aid of
 
04:18:39.830 --> 04:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
5050 million why not the
 
04:18:42.030 --> 04:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
39 well let me let's let's talk the
 
04:18:43.510 --> 04:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
whole thing and then a free and reduced
 
04:18:47.630 --> 04:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:50.830 --> 04:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:53.510 --> 04:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
mean you you I mean Rick you know I'm a
 
04:18:56.189 --> 04:18:56.199 align:start position:0%
transactional based guy on on this type
 
04:18:58.389 --> 04:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
of on this type of stuff and if if we're
 
04:19:01.510 --> 04:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
close let's let's let's get close but if
 
04:19:03.189 --> 04:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
you're willing to do free introduced
 
04:19:04.910 --> 04:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
price launch and we know how much free
 
04:19:07.870 --> 04:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
introduced price launch is a cost Factor
 
04:19:10.309 --> 04:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
um then I'm not going to quibble and me
 
04:19:11.950 --> 04:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
Mel can kick me under the table I
 
04:19:15.149 --> 04:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't quibble on on 10 or 11 million
 
04:19:17.710 --> 04:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
on fiscal capacity disparity I mean I I
 
04:19:19.030 --> 04:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
don't have permission to say the only
 
04:19:20.670 --> 04:19:20.680 align:start position:0%
difference you want that the whole
 
04:19:24.870 --> 04:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:29.429 --> 04:19:29.439 align:start position:0%
7124 so that totals up to what 98
 
04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
million 34 39 25
 
04:19:35.640 --> 04:19:37.790 align:start position:0%
million 34 39 25
yep

04:19:37.790 --> 04:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
yep
 
04:19:39.790 --> 04:19:39.800 align:start position:0%
par me plus the plus the
 
04:19:42.790 --> 04:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
35 but that's SE I me sorry plus the 45
 
04:19:45.630 --> 04:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
separate bill y y yes right yeah it's
 
04:19:47.750 --> 04:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
coming out of the same it's the same
 
04:19:55.229 --> 04:19:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:58.510 --> 04:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we're still way apart we're
 
04:20:01.269 --> 04:20:01.279 align:start position:0%
not that far apart yeah we
 
04:20:05.030 --> 04:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
are just change the base increase to to
 
04:20:07.710 --> 04:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
25 that's why we have
 
04:20:11.870 --> 04:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
Mark do the comparison you see exactly
 
04:20:13.630 --> 04:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
side by side
 
04:20:15.630 --> 04:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
almost I think
 
04:20:18.790 --> 04:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
you're TR TR Tracy's on to a good
 
04:20:20.590 --> 04:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
thought on
 
04:20:24.950 --> 04:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
that the other on 24 and just the base
 
04:20:26.630 --> 04:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
move off to
 
04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
25 so everything else you want goes into
 
04:20:35.109 --> 04:20:35.119 align:start position:0%
24 so so so base would
 
04:20:37.910 --> 04:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
be 7
 
04:20:41.830 --> 04:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
125 um phisical capacity disparity Aid
 
04:20:43.830 --> 04:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
of I'm just going to round 39 up to 40
 
04:20:47.710 --> 04:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
million 7124 right free introduced price
 
04:20:49.870 --> 04:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
lunch at 25
 
04:20:52.790 --> 04:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
7124 and the special education category
 
04:21:05.189 --> 04:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:08.950 --> 04:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
close I vot so no no but I mean but
 
04:21:12.309 --> 04:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
you're yeah yeah your vote counts in the
 
04:21:14.830 --> 04:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
next committee
 
04:21:20.389 --> 04:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
so yeah yeah well that I think that's
 
04:21:23.269 --> 04:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
more palatable so it doesn't Wipe Out
 
04:21:25.349 --> 04:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
the the whole
 
04:21:27.910 --> 04:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
fund what is the bottom line total
 
04:21:29.389 --> 04:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
amount of money work when chasing from
 
04:21:31.469 --> 04:21:31.479 align:start position:0%
the trust
 
04:21:34.990 --> 04:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
fund uh it would be so we
 
04:21:39.349 --> 04:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
came down 10 off that and
 
04:21:45.750 --> 04:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
um and 45 so 55 so uh we were at 140 so
 
04:21:48.030 --> 04:21:48.040 align:start position:0%
we're that would be 90 in the in the
 
04:21:50.710 --> 04:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
first year and then
 
04:21:53.149 --> 04:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
45 plus the
 
04:21:56.109 --> 04:21:56.119 align:start position:0%
N the the base wouldn't wouldn't come
 
04:21:58.389 --> 04:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
off in the first year so it would be I
 
04:22:00.229 --> 04:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
think it would be 90 it looks like in
 
04:22:04.710 --> 04:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:07.510 --> 04:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
year don't forg already budged the
 
04:22:07.520 --> 04:22:09.189 align:start position:0%
year don't forg already budged the
second

04:22:09.189 --> 04:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:22:12.910 --> 04:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
year already so
 
04:22:15.550 --> 04:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
adding making up that 90 break down the
 
04:22:21.590 --> 04:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
90 for me the 90 would be um 35 um 40 m
 
04:22:24.189 --> 04:22:24.199 align:start position:0%
I'm just using numbers that end in zeros
 
04:22:26.229 --> 04:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
pretty much fiscal capacity disparity of
 
04:22:28.030 --> 04:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
$40 million
 
04:22:30.750 --> 04:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
391 40 million 40 million free
 
04:22:35.070 --> 04:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:37.269 --> 04:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
million um
 
04:22:37.279 --> 04:22:38.550 align:start position:0%
million um
special

04:22:38.550 --> 04:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
special
 
04:22:44.910 --> 04:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:49.189 --> 04:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
million is that up to 90
 
04:22:53.750 --> 04:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
10 yeah yeah 100 yeah good because I I
 
04:23:00.630 --> 04:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:05.279 --> 04:23:12.469 align:start position:0%
 
7124

04:23:12.469 --> 04:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:15.670 --> 04:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah yeah and and and and and
 
04:23:18.750 --> 04:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and some real important things that
 
04:23:21.349 --> 04:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
that none of this presses into the home
 
04:23:21.359 --> 04:23:23.189 align:start position:0%
that none of this presses into the home
hold

04:23:23.189 --> 04:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
hold
 
04:23:25.389 --> 04:23:25.399 align:start position:0%
harmless only extraordinary needs
 
04:23:27.429 --> 04:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
presses in to hold harmless this doesn't
 
04:23:30.309 --> 04:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
not Penny of this presses in to hold
 
04:23:32.429 --> 04:23:32.439 align:start position:0%
harmless sure you're not talked about
 
04:23:35.870 --> 04:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
the base at all base base will will will
 
04:23:37.590 --> 04:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
push up off to
 
04:23:40.269 --> 04:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
7125 and and that's going to be subject
 
04:23:45.070 --> 04:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
to the next budget anyway so you know
 
04:23:53.309 --> 04:23:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:55.990 --> 04:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
so could get down to 99 if you had the
 
04:23:59.630 --> 04:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal disp disparity at at 39 like they
 
04:24:01.950 --> 04:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
were told don't round it up don't round
 
04:24:06.269 --> 04:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
it up I'm okay I'm yeah I'm okay yeah I
 
04:24:08.229 --> 04:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
was just I was just using numbers and
 
04:24:10.109 --> 04:24:10.119 align:start position:0%
zeros yeah I know we just numbers are
 
04:24:12.189 --> 04:24:12.199 align:start position:0%
easy when they're not yours huh it's not
 
04:24:14.590 --> 04:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
coming out of your pocket well it it is
 
04:24:16.870 --> 04:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's all coming out of our pocket I said
 
04:24:21.269 --> 04:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:23.830 --> 04:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
soy here I just want to where did the
 
04:24:25.349 --> 04:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
free and reduced come from because
 
04:24:26.510 --> 04:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
that's the first time that's been
 
04:24:30.269 --> 04:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
introduced into no we we um represent
 
04:24:33.510 --> 04:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
lad and I worked on this we we've worked
 
04:24:35.790 --> 04:24:35.800 align:start position:0%
on this together for many many years
 
04:24:40.469 --> 04:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
going back to 2019 I think and um and
 
04:24:44.229 --> 04:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
the the the the the the evidence behind
 
04:24:47.670 --> 04:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
the costs associated with with with um
 
04:24:50.550 --> 04:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh providing instruction and and and
 
04:24:52.309 --> 04:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
educational outcomes for students that
 
04:24:53.950 --> 04:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
come from low-income families comes
 
04:24:56.109 --> 04:24:56.119 align:start position:0%
directly out of the work we did on the
 
04:24:59.309 --> 04:24:59.319 align:start position:0%
study commission but um but it also came
 
04:25:02.070 --> 04:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
out of uh out of work we did together on
 
04:25:05.710 --> 04:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill 709 and on House Bill 529
 
04:25:07.469 --> 04:25:07.479 align:start position:0%
that went into the budget that was later
 
04:25:10.910 --> 04:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
ripped out in the uh in the Senate so
 
04:25:12.189 --> 04:25:12.199 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about the fnr you're
 
04:25:13.950 --> 04:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
talking about taking it in the
 
04:25:15.870 --> 04:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
differentiated a category or on the
 
04:25:17.630 --> 04:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
right hand side on the right hand side
 
04:25:21.229 --> 04:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
04:25:23.710 --> 04:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
in effective
 
04:25:28.710 --> 04:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
7124 we are looking at $74 million the
 
04:25:31.550 --> 04:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
special ed plus the free and
 
04:25:36.950 --> 04:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
reduced and you're looking at in 7124
 
04:25:40.429 --> 04:25:40.439 align:start position:0%
uh the free and reduced the
 
04:25:44.070 --> 04:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
fnr and the special ed for let's say one
 
04:25:47.510 --> 04:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
98 99 I think let's not chip another
 
04:25:48.870 --> 04:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
million yes right what's a million
 
04:25:52.349 --> 04:25:52.359 align:start position:0%
dollar here and there um clarify that I
 
04:25:54.349 --> 04:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
think you said that our position was the
 
04:25:57.189 --> 04:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
free and reduced but it was the um
 
04:26:00.469 --> 04:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity a I had both
 
04:26:04.389 --> 04:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal disparity a was the 39 was the 39
 
04:26:06.630 --> 04:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
plus free and reduced
 
04:26:09.750 --> 04:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
25 yeah
 
04:26:12.149 --> 04:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:26:14.830 --> 04:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
that's we're basically at 74 and you're
 
04:26:19.630 --> 04:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
basically at 99 for uh uh F year well
 
04:26:23.070 --> 04:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
hold on we no we're we're not at 99
 
04:26:27.189 --> 04:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
unless you're at 99 um oh okay yeah so
 
04:26:30.070 --> 04:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
um we we'll we'll want right but right
 
04:26:32.469 --> 04:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
that at the moment that's where we are
 
04:26:35.070 --> 04:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
well we only came down to you know we
 
04:26:37.670 --> 04:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
gave up we gave up base to
 
04:26:41.269 --> 04:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
25 if and we gave up fiscal capacity
 
04:26:44.950 --> 04:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
disparity from 50 to 39 um with your
 
04:26:47.109 --> 04:26:47.119 align:start position:0%
agreement to add free introduced price
 
04:26:49.870 --> 04:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
lunch the expanded FRP on the right hand
 
04:26:54.189 --> 04:26:54.199 align:start position:0%
side to 25 right so you're if if we come
 
04:26:56.990 --> 04:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
to uh that could be a common shaking of
 
04:27:01.229 --> 04:27:01.239 align:start position:0%
hands on that you're at 99 for Effective
 
04:27:06.389 --> 04:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
7124 and we're um we're at 74 no be at
 
04:27:10.349 --> 04:27:10.359 align:start position:0%
99 on I'm sorry right we'd both be at 99
 
04:27:13.710 --> 04:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
99 we we can shake hands if and the base
 
04:27:17.950 --> 04:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
in in 25 correct
 
04:27:21.710 --> 04:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
right as well as um both in agreement on
 
04:27:26.429 --> 04:27:26.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:29.790 --> 04:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
04:27:33.229 --> 04:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
go you on no more talking yeah it's a
 
04:27:37.070 --> 04:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
Friday afternoon get it over with
 
04:27:40.670 --> 04:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
okay I I think were you on
 
04:27:43.389 --> 04:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
that excuse me I'm just pointing out the
 
04:27:46.790 --> 04:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
25 away from 99 puts us exactly the same
 
04:27:50.710 --> 04:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
I'm just the free reduced um is is has a
 
04:27:54.109 --> 04:27:54.119 align:start position:0%
background that just reappeared and I'm
 
04:27:56.710 --> 04:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
just a little bit behind on
 
04:28:00.910 --> 04:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
that yeah I mean you know Cher lad you
 
04:28:03.389 --> 04:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
can you speak to this as well as anybody
 
04:28:04.830 --> 04:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
on on
 
04:28:04.840 --> 04:28:07.710 align:start position:0%
on on
the

04:28:07.710 --> 04:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:10.149 --> 04:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
cost of Education
 
04:28:13.030 --> 04:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
with yeah it's a it's an important area
 
04:28:15.269 --> 04:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
that helps the towns which are needing
 
04:28:18.510 --> 04:28:18.520 align:start position:0%
it your town I I get that I'm just
 
04:28:20.870 --> 04:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
saying that that wasn't in any of my
 
04:28:24.429 --> 04:28:24.439 align:start position:0%
notes coming up to right now
 
04:28:28.189 --> 04:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
yeah that was part of hb2 I think it was
 
04:28:31.349 --> 04:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
yeah it was hb2 part hb2 that we were
 
04:28:35.309 --> 04:28:35.319 align:start position:0%
talking about so we're we're I think
 
04:28:36.670 --> 04:28:36.680 align:start position:0%
that we're at at a point where we can
 
04:28:39.550 --> 04:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
take something back to the committee as
 
04:28:43.469 --> 04:28:43.479 align:start position:0%
a whole and let it be decided there um
 
04:28:45.630 --> 04:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
so all those in favor of a
 
04:28:50.510 --> 04:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation I'll read it 39 for um
 
04:28:52.149 --> 04:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal disparity
 
04:28:57.670 --> 04:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
Aid 25 for fnr and 35 for special
 
04:29:00.590 --> 04:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
education weighted values all to be done
 
04:29:00.600 --> 04:29:03.750 align:start position:0%
education weighted values all to be done
by

04:29:03.750 --> 04:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:08.269 --> 04:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
7124 and then the base of 4404 and 7125
 
04:29:12.149 --> 04:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
right and then the and the we already
 
04:29:15.510 --> 04:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
said the the the special education are
 
04:29:19.149 --> 04:29:19.159 align:start position:0%
calculated against the
 
04:29:24.070 --> 04:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
4404 so the the 35 so the
 
04:29:26.710 --> 04:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
34 which is the
 
04:29:32.469 --> 04:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
4404 is recommended for july25 correct y
 
04:29:35.990 --> 04:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
say it again I just said the the instead
 
04:29:39.309 --> 04:29:39.319 align:start position:0%
of saying 4404 I was also saying that $
 
04:29:42.349 --> 04:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
34.3 million is what it adds up to as an
 
04:29:45.550 --> 04:29:45.560 align:start position:0%
increase that will be done that involves
 
04:29:48.349 --> 04:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
the 4404 from
 
04:29:52.109 --> 04:29:52.119 align:start position:0%
4182 um that that would occur in July 1
 
04:29:55.910 --> 04:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
2025 correct yeah
 
04:30:00.550 --> 04:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
so okay let's have a a vote on that from
 
04:30:03.269 --> 04:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
the par me yeah yeah Mark will do a full
 
04:30:06.309 --> 04:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
Mark will'll do the numbers by 10 well
 
04:30:10.229 --> 04:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
that that yeah but that's not
 
04:30:10.239 --> 04:30:11.910 align:start position:0%
that that yeah but that's not
that's

04:30:11.910 --> 04:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:30:14.550 --> 04:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
explain so what you're doing
 
04:30:18.510 --> 04:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
here focusing on the policy yes first
 
04:30:27.469 --> 04:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:30.510 --> 04:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
some yep that's right that we'll vote on
 
04:30:32.950 --> 04:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
the policy side of it and and and and
 
04:30:35.630 --> 04:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
just from a I I thought the way mark
 
04:30:38.790 --> 04:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
laid out the policy particularly on on
 
04:30:42.109 --> 04:30:42.119 align:start position:0%
um fiscal capacity disparity uh looking
 
04:30:45.469 --> 04:30:45.479 align:start position:0%
at at what whatever the low EVP is and
 
04:30:48.469 --> 04:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
what evpp and whatever the median evpp
 
04:30:55.349 --> 04:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
is and um median the average or
 
04:30:55.359 --> 04:30:57.670 align:start position:0%
is and um median the average or
or

04:30:57.670 --> 04:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:31:01.630 --> 04:31:01.640 align:start position:0%
average yeah I think that's what we did
 
04:31:05.750 --> 04:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
too yeah yeah yeah and then you put 39
 
04:31:07.790 --> 04:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
million on
 
04:31:12.550 --> 04:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
that yep yep yep and um and then free
 
04:31:15.870 --> 04:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
and reduced price lunch actually you you
 
04:31:17.630 --> 04:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
did the numbers when we when we did the
 
04:31:22.030 --> 04:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:26.030 --> 04:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
that be 25 so double whatever got great
 
04:31:28.189 --> 04:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
okay so let's let's take a vote of the
 
04:31:29.950 --> 04:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
education committee members
 
04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:37.790 --> 04:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
tables the roll call we don't have to do
 
04:31:39.630 --> 04:31:39.640 align:start position:0%
that in the
 
04:31:42.950 --> 04:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee yeah it we're not going to
 
04:31:43.830 --> 04:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:31:47.670 --> 04:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
here we're on so let's walk around the
 
04:31:54.389 --> 04:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:58.630 --> 04:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:01.469 --> 04:32:01.479 align:start position:0%
cascaden yes represent luno represent
 
04:32:04.189 --> 04:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
Miler represent cordelli yes
 
04:32:06.670 --> 04:32:06.680 align:start position:0%
representative dry
 
04:32:08.030 --> 04:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
represent lad
 
04:32:10.830 --> 04:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
yes so we have a recommendation to take
 
04:32:13.189 --> 04:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
back to the committee the other thing we
 
04:32:17.070 --> 04:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
have to look at here is have a motion on
 
04:32:21.870 --> 04:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
15 1686 this is on
 
04:32:26.710 --> 04:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
the the uh no it's I like to establish a
 
04:32:28.790 --> 04:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
foundation op that one
 
04:32:31.269 --> 04:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
1586 and I think we're all in
 
04:32:33.349 --> 04:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
concurrence that we do a conscientious
 
04:32:36.309 --> 04:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
job of interim study on that and and and
 
04:32:38.590 --> 04:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
get down and start as soon as possible
 
04:32:46.830 --> 04:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:49.710 --> 04:32:49.720 align:start position:0%
education they're all due and we will be
 
04:32:52.790 --> 04:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
voting on the report in November so so
 
04:32:54.149 --> 04:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
the dates are already down in the
 
04:32:57.229 --> 04:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
calendar so interim study is something
 
04:33:01.030 --> 04:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's we don't decide the dates they're
 
04:33:07.470 --> 04:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:11.629 --> 04:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
so oh Oh I thought you were sorry 1586
 
04:33:15.750 --> 04:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
1586 yeah yeah we're in study right yeah
 
04:33:18.709 --> 04:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
so let's take let's take uh a vote on
 
04:33:22.869 --> 04:33:22.879 align:start position:0%
that are you ready to go first time okay
 
04:33:26.551 --> 04:33:26.561 align:start position:0%
yes represent cordelli yes represent
 
04:33:29.390 --> 04:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
Miler represent Luna yes represent
 
04:33:31.789 --> 04:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
cascaden yes and represent lad yes so
 
04:33:34.349 --> 04:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
that we're unanimous on
 
04:33:39.310 --> 04:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:43.189 --> 04:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
here um six
 
04:33:43.199 --> 04:33:45.670 align:start position:0%
here um six
1686

04:33:45.670 --> 04:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
1686
 
04:33:49.789 --> 04:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:49.799 --> 04:33:51.349 align:start position:0%
 
itl

04:33:51.349 --> 04:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
itl
 
04:33:54.390 --> 04:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
second you unfortunately you you're not
 
04:33:56.949 --> 04:33:56.959 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote um I want to have a
 
04:33:58.470 --> 04:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
discussion first than
 
04:34:01.230 --> 04:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
that because we haven't discussed it
 
04:34:06.629 --> 04:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
yet so um we know that the excess swep
 
04:34:09.590 --> 04:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
is a little less than 30 million
 
04:34:11.349 --> 04:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
rejected out the year after that
 
04:34:13.590 --> 04:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 26 I can't recall Mark
 
04:34:15.070 --> 04:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
you know those numbers better than
 
04:34:21.109 --> 04:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
anybody here um so concept is that the I
 
04:34:23.390 --> 04:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
think the way we're looking at it that
 
04:34:26.470 --> 04:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
the town still collects it but has to
 
04:34:30.189 --> 04:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
return the access to to the treasury or
 
04:34:32.949 --> 04:34:32.959 align:start position:0%
to Department I don't
 
04:34:35.629 --> 04:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
know to the treasury yeah how the bill
 
04:34:37.949 --> 04:34:37.959 align:start position:0%
read the bill reads that it all goes to
 
04:34:40.109 --> 04:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
the treasury and then makes dispersement
 
04:34:41.470 --> 04:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
04:34:48.349 --> 04:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:50.990 --> 04:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
excess no
 
04:34:55.830 --> 04:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
16 1686 is just excess so the excess is
 
04:35:02.029 --> 04:35:02.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:04.189 --> 04:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
04:35:09.510 --> 04:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
so so we we have that to deal with know
 
04:35:10.910 --> 04:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
that we're also going to be talking
 
04:35:12.590 --> 04:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
about this in
 
04:35:15.910 --> 04:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
1586 right so it's incorporated into
 
04:35:17.990 --> 04:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
that discussion as well so it's in
 
04:35:20.150 --> 04:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
actually two places within what we have
 
04:35:24.230 --> 04:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
to do here um 1686
 
04:35:27.670 --> 04:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
is it's going to be you know vote your
 
04:35:29.990 --> 04:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
conscience or what your town wants you
 
04:35:33.670 --> 04:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
to do I think more than party but at any
 
04:35:35.949 --> 04:35:35.959 align:start position:0%
rate yeah
 
04:35:39.189 --> 04:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
I think that's about 27 27 of us that be
 
04:35:42.230 --> 04:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
so so let me let me let me float float
 
04:35:44.910 --> 04:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
float an idea you have a lot of people
 
04:35:46.470 --> 04:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
though in that number of towns let me
 
04:35:48.230 --> 04:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
float an idea in
 
04:35:53.470 --> 04:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
1686 and and and you know I I I do not
 
04:35:57.070 --> 04:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
agree with the um Coalition Community
 
04:36:02.510 --> 04:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
position that um that that that
 
04:36:05.470 --> 04:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have to contribute
 
04:36:07.269 --> 04:36:07.279 align:start position:0%
towards the state tax that's used to
 
04:36:10.590 --> 04:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
fund education and that by if they were
 
04:36:13.629 --> 04:36:13.639 align:start position:0%
to contribute to such a fund that they
 
04:36:17.590 --> 04:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
would would the towns would be owed some
 
04:36:20.551 --> 04:36:20.561 align:start position:0%
level of accountability on the use of a
 
04:36:24.310 --> 04:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
state tax I I I just don't agree that
 
04:36:26.551 --> 04:36:26.561 align:start position:0%
last part I have you know because state
 
04:36:28.869 --> 04:36:28.879 align:start position:0%
tax the state deserves accountability
 
04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
but but the towns don't um and
 
04:36:36.949 --> 04:36:36.959 align:start position:0%
and but if the if
 
04:36:41.789 --> 04:36:41.799 align:start position:0%
the if a portion of the concern over a
 
04:36:45.590 --> 04:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
over a Statewide property tax is for its
 
04:36:49.109 --> 04:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
use in education then as an alternative
 
04:36:53.070 --> 04:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:01.189 --> 04:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:03.429 --> 04:37:03.439 align:start position:0%
Bridges that's good
 
04:37:05.670 --> 04:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
question would that be more
 
04:37:09.349 --> 04:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
more no it's disappearing from the town
 
04:37:11.551 --> 04:37:11.561 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter what it USS for it's
 
04:37:13.709 --> 04:37:13.719 align:start position:0%
the paper
 
04:37:16.670 --> 04:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
right I'd be willing to put an amendment
 
04:37:18.629 --> 04:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
that the excess stays with the town but
 
04:37:22.949 --> 04:37:22.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:25.670 --> 04:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
purposes Mr chairman there was a bill
 
04:37:27.150 --> 04:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
that I handed out I can't put my hands
 
04:37:29.269 --> 04:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
on it which was
 
04:37:33.109 --> 04:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
hb77 and I can't find it in this mass of
 
04:37:35.029 --> 04:37:35.039 align:start position:0%
paperwork here but there was one we
 
04:37:37.789 --> 04:37:37.799 align:start position:0%
introduced represent so so the the
 
04:37:39.029 --> 04:37:39.039 align:start position:0%
premise of
 
04:37:41.029 --> 04:37:41.039 align:start position:0%
hb6 uh
 
04:37:44.510 --> 04:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
86 is to deal with a constitutional
 
04:37:46.869 --> 04:37:46.879 align:start position:0%
problem that has to do with Equitable
 
04:37:50.750 --> 04:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
funding of education so redirecting the
 
04:37:55.910 --> 04:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:03.910 --> 04:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:03.920 --> 04:38:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
depi

04:38:05.990 --> 04:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
depi
 
04:38:12.029 --> 04:38:12.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:15.230 --> 04:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
okay yeah well a deeper discussion of
 
04:38:17.830 --> 04:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
swept for another day i' I'd love to
 
04:38:20.629 --> 04:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
join in but right now if we're just
 
04:38:22.510 --> 04:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
talking about the
 
04:38:24.869 --> 04:38:24.879 align:start position:0%
excess um it's clearly got to be for
 
04:38:24.879 --> 04:38:26.869 align:start position:0%
excess um it's clearly got to be for
education

04:38:26.869 --> 04:38:26.879 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:38:29.150 --> 04:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
purposes here here's an amendment which
 
04:38:33.670 --> 04:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:37.150 --> 04:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
337 and this was
 
04:38:43.150 --> 04:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:46.070 --> 04:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
2009 have representative hes Flanigan
 
04:38:50.670 --> 04:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
lad Kirk Benton court and Jaspers
 
04:38:53.789 --> 04:38:53.799 align:start position:0%
oldtimers and it reads as follows a
 
04:38:55.869 --> 04:38:55.879 align:start position:0%
municipality May remit the balance of
 
04:38:59.429 --> 04:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
such excess or any portion there thereof
 
04:39:00.789 --> 04:39:00.799 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Revenue
 
04:39:02.349 --> 04:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
Administration as provided in this
 
04:39:05.109 --> 04:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
paragraph or retain the balance of such
 
04:39:07.230 --> 04:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
excess to be used in the current fiscal
 
04:39:09.869 --> 04:39:09.879 align:start position:0%
year or a future fiscal year to offset
 
04:39:11.269 --> 04:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
the costs of school building
 
04:39:14.150 --> 04:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
construction or renovation project or to
 
04:39:16.349 --> 04:39:16.359 align:start position:0%
offset catastrophic special education
 
04:39:18.869 --> 04:39:18.879 align:start position:0%
costs incurred provided that not
 
04:39:20.590 --> 04:39:20.600 align:start position:0%
withstanding the eligibility Provisions
 
04:39:22.349 --> 04:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
set forth in RSA
 
04:39:29.470 --> 04:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
1985a through 19815 h 19815 u through uh
 
04:39:32.709 --> 04:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
19815 W we're talking about building Aid
 
04:39:37.350 --> 04:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
there I think uh and 186 c18 the
 
04:39:40.110 --> 04:39:40.120 align:start position:0%
municipality shall exhaust such excess
 
04:39:42.150 --> 04:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
as a condition of eligibility for school
 
04:39:44.628 --> 04:39:44.638 align:start position:0%
building Aid alternative school building
 
04:39:46.628 --> 04:39:46.638 align:start position:0%
Aid or catastrophic special education
 
04:39:48.470 --> 04:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
Aid so what I was basically trying to do
 
04:39:50.830 --> 04:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
is say you use it for those specific
 
04:39:52.670 --> 04:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
purposes it could be expanded to make
 
04:39:55.070 --> 04:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
sure it's used for Education can I
 
04:39:58.868 --> 04:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
comment on that but those non excess
 
04:40:01.708 --> 04:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
swept towns will not have that you know
 
04:40:03.430 --> 04:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
I live in the city of Manchester the
 
04:40:05.270 --> 04:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester
 
04:40:08.150 --> 04:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
generates a large amount of money in
 
04:40:12.190 --> 04:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
terms of lotto in terms of Kino in terms
 
04:40:17.470 --> 04:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
of any number we don't say we generate
 
04:40:19.670 --> 04:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
those monies so we want to keep them all
 
04:40:22.030 --> 04:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
we they go out to the state and they're
 
04:40:24.070 --> 04:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
used for the roads they're used for all
 
04:40:26.830 --> 04:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
different purposes so places like the
 
04:40:29.750 --> 04:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester and Nashua why should
 
04:40:33.390 --> 04:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
we be penalized and the people that
 
04:40:36.350 --> 04:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
can re raise more than they need to
 
04:40:38.910 --> 04:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
raise for swep are allowed to keep it
 
04:40:40.948 --> 04:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
for those purposes that means that we're
 
04:40:42.670 --> 04:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
going to get a double whimy with a
 
04:40:44.190 --> 04:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
building Aid because we don't get it
 
04:40:48.070 --> 04:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:52.190 --> 04:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
it any further discussion on it rips and
 
04:40:56.590 --> 04:40:56.600 align:start position:0%
hes um I guess two things one is the
 
04:41:01.310 --> 04:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
FYI there is a uh another swep bill that
 
04:41:04.110 --> 04:41:04.120 align:start position:0%
uh came to the house floor a few weeks
 
04:41:07.788 --> 04:41:07.798 align:start position:0%
ago on the consent calendar and uh then
 
04:41:10.270 --> 04:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
was referred for interim study to Ways
 
04:41:15.470 --> 04:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
and Means and that bill um sends all
 
04:41:18.910 --> 04:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
collected re revenue from the swept tax
 
04:41:22.390 --> 04:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
to the Dr for depositing the education
 
04:41:26.670 --> 04:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
trust fund less a 3% processing fee
 
04:41:28.270 --> 04:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
that's allowed to the
 
04:41:32.470 --> 04:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities and then also has a uh uh
 
04:41:35.550 --> 04:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
changes in the hormonal low and moderate
 
04:41:40.708 --> 04:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
income um what's it rebate program um
 
04:41:44.190 --> 04:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
and uh uh so so that's been returned
 
04:41:47.190 --> 04:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
it's an interim study in ways and means
 
04:41:49.070 --> 04:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh we'll see what happens with it it's a
 
04:41:50.910 --> 04:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
bill that I sponsored uh that's been
 
04:41:54.110 --> 04:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
hanging around for quite a while um it's
 
04:41:56.310 --> 04:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
it's essentially the same as what's in
 
04:41:57.948 --> 04:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
the back of
 
04:41:57.958 --> 04:41:59.948 align:start position:0%
the back of
hp5

04:41:59.948 --> 04:41:59.958 align:start position:0%
hp5
 
04:41:59.958 --> 04:42:02.628 align:start position:0%
hp5
1586

04:42:02.628 --> 04:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
1586
 
04:42:05.628 --> 04:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
um just so you know there is an interim
 
04:42:07.670 --> 04:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
study on this same subject were you the
 
04:42:09.868 --> 04:42:09.878 align:start position:0%
first committee to receive it or did go
 
04:42:10.788 --> 04:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
to another
 
04:42:14.708 --> 04:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
committee first committee first me and
 
04:42:19.190 --> 04:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
then um the other comment is that I
 
04:42:19.200 --> 04:42:20.628 align:start position:0%
then um the other comment is that I
think

04:42:20.628 --> 04:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:42:24.510 --> 04:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
uh on this legal
 
04:42:27.150 --> 04:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
issue that
 
04:42:30.110 --> 04:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
um well I just Express an opinion the
 
04:42:33.628 --> 04:42:33.638 align:start position:0%
likelihood is that this part of uh Rua's
 
04:42:38.628 --> 04:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
work on school funding um is uh likely
 
04:42:43.230 --> 04:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
to be approved um I say that based
 
04:42:45.948 --> 04:42:45.958 align:start position:0%
on you know just my understanding of the
 
04:42:50.708 --> 04:42:50.718 align:start position:0%
law and uh others others input um
 
04:42:54.590 --> 04:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
ardener uh Mr ardinger um feels very
 
04:42:57.390 --> 04:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
strongly along those lines and uh shared
 
04:42:59.470 --> 04:42:59.480 align:start position:0%
his views with Ways and Means which is
 
04:43:01.190 --> 04:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why we went into
 
04:43:04.150 --> 04:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
interim study on this um and I think any
 
04:43:04.160 --> 04:43:05.430 align:start position:0%
interim study on this um and I think any
bill

04:43:05.430 --> 04:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:43:09.470 --> 04:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
that that tries to retain for the
 
04:43:11.788 --> 04:43:11.798 align:start position:0%
locality where the money was generated
 
04:43:14.070 --> 04:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
in any any way or
 
04:43:17.590 --> 04:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
form is going to trespass on the notion
 
04:43:20.868 --> 04:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
that this is a state tax needs to go for
 
04:43:23.628 --> 04:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
Statewide purposes and not be
 
04:43:26.070 --> 04:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
essentially rebated to the taxpayers who
 
04:43:28.590 --> 04:43:28.600 align:start position:0%
generated it because that that's the
 
04:43:30.310 --> 04:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
inequality that's the lack of
 
04:43:34.708 --> 04:43:34.718 align:start position:0%
proportionality that uh that U um makes
 
04:43:38.750 --> 04:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
the whole uh swept model with the
 
04:43:42.230 --> 04:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
provision allowing retention
 
04:43:46.110 --> 04:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
um unconstitutional in the views of many
 
04:43:48.310 --> 04:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
and uh you know so take that for what
 
04:43:50.430 --> 04:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
it's worth everybody has an opinion on
 
04:43:53.708 --> 04:43:53.718 align:start position:0%
what's constitutional what's not um and
 
04:43:56.550 --> 04:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
I think uh there's a good chance that in
 
04:43:59.670 --> 04:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
this case uh this swep tax with the
 
04:44:03.470 --> 04:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
retention of excess swept is is headed
 
04:44:06.230 --> 04:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
for a definitive and final ruling that
 
04:44:06.240 --> 04:44:07.470 align:start position:0%
for a definitive and final ruling that
it's

04:44:07.470 --> 04:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:44:09.990 --> 04:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional uh so we need if that's
 
04:44:11.708 --> 04:44:11.718 align:start position:0%
the case we need to figure out what to
 
04:44:13.948 --> 04:44:13.958 align:start position:0%
do with it is not really a school
 
04:44:19.868 --> 04:44:19.878 align:start position:0%
funding issue right now um and uh uh it
 
04:44:24.708 --> 04:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
uh is a taxpayer issue um so there's
 
04:44:27.830 --> 04:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
some time to work on it
 
04:44:32.670 --> 04:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
what's five do you have 569 569 sounds
 
04:44:35.628 --> 04:44:35.638 align:start position:0%
good got five and a n I'm not sure about
 
04:44:37.110 --> 04:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
the middle
 
04:44:39.628 --> 04:44:39.638 align:start position:0%
digit dick could you also talk a little
 
04:44:44.110 --> 04:44:44.120 align:start position:0%
bit about um how the um how the order on
 
04:44:48.628 --> 04:44:48.638 align:start position:0%
on um on Rand what the timing is for
 
04:44:52.150 --> 04:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
that um well it's been
 
04:44:55.910 --> 04:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
appealed so everything's on hold stayed
 
04:44:58.430 --> 04:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not it can't happen it's
 
04:45:00.310 --> 04:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
getting you know it's really gotten to
 
04:45:02.708 --> 04:45:02.718 align:start position:0%
the point where it's too late going
 
04:45:04.868 --> 04:45:04.878 align:start position:0%
through this next cycle
 
04:45:08.190 --> 04:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
we're into that cycle so um who knows
 
04:45:11.550 --> 04:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
when the court will get to it and when
 
04:45:14.270 --> 04:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
they do it's going to have to impact on
 
04:45:18.110 --> 04:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
the next time around and um you know
 
04:45:20.750 --> 04:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
presumably the general court the
 
04:45:23.670 --> 04:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
legislature will respond
 
04:45:26.310 --> 04:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
and do something but basically that's
 
04:45:27.590 --> 04:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing that I think the
 
04:45:30.868 --> 04:45:30.878 align:start position:0%
courts better suited to uh to get in the
 
04:45:34.948 --> 04:45:34.958 align:start position:0%
way of uh a law than uh than school
 
04:45:37.030 --> 04:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
funding is school funding is more
 
04:45:38.670 --> 04:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
complicated and involves imp
 
04:45:40.868 --> 04:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
Appropriations this is just saying you
 
04:45:51.470 --> 04:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:55.788 --> 04:45:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:00.470 --> 04:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah yeah it would if if uh if what's
 
04:46:02.990 --> 04:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
in 1586 were to
 
04:46:05.430 --> 04:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
pass that would send all the money
 
04:46:09.628 --> 04:46:09.638 align:start position:0%
collected to the state and that's the
 
04:46:13.470 --> 04:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
issue 1686 would also
 
04:46:16.310 --> 04:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
probably uh be sufficient uh there's
 
04:46:18.910 --> 04:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
some question about how you calculate
 
04:46:21.430 --> 04:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
EXs weep because you don't really know
 
04:46:24.310 --> 04:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
for sure until all the numbers all the
 
04:46:25.990 --> 04:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
collections have happened and so forth
 
04:46:30.750 --> 04:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
probably yes
 
04:46:36.390 --> 04:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
rcad just just to add to that a little
 
04:46:39.510 --> 04:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
bit the summary judgment was ruled on
 
04:46:42.910 --> 04:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
for SWAT correct and it requires a
 
04:46:45.670 --> 04:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
uniform rate I'm not hearing anybody
 
04:46:48.430 --> 04:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
talk about setting a uniform rate we're
 
04:46:50.670 --> 04:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
only talking about excess monies don't
 
04:46:53.590 --> 04:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
we have to do both no no there the lack
 
04:46:56.830 --> 04:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
of a a uniform rate deres from the
 
04:46:59.548 --> 04:46:59.558 align:start position:0%
sending um from the
 
04:47:03.230 --> 04:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
retention of the excess money by the
 
04:47:06.750 --> 04:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
municipality so so in effect it's it's
 
04:47:09.030 --> 04:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
money coming back to the same taxpayers
 
04:47:12.430 --> 04:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
that generated that paid a122
 
04:47:16.230 --> 04:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
per uh thousand and now they're getting
 
04:47:20.868 --> 04:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
back 22 let's 22 cents per th000 because
 
04:47:23.430 --> 04:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
that excess swep actually was put back
 
04:47:25.390 --> 04:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
into their
 
04:47:27.948 --> 04:47:27.958 align:start position:0%
pot something like that I don't know I'm
 
04:47:31.750 --> 04:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
just is is that clear the122 is the
 
04:47:34.110 --> 04:47:34.120 align:start position:0%
uniform rate it's then adjusted based on
 
04:47:37.390 --> 04:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
unequalized valuation it's this uh
 
04:47:40.430 --> 04:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
retention of the excess that distorts
 
04:47:44.190 --> 04:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
that and that's the practice that as as
 
04:47:44.200 --> 04:47:45.390 align:start position:0%
that and that's the practice that as as
Davis

04:47:45.390 --> 04:47:45.400 align:start position:0%
Davis
 
04:47:49.350 --> 04:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
suggested we've got bills that hit this
 
04:47:51.788 --> 04:47:51.798 align:start position:0%
issue in three different ways any one of
 
04:47:53.910 --> 04:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
which in my opinion would moot that
 
04:47:56.030 --> 04:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
specific claim while the rest of the
 
04:48:02.110 --> 04:48:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:33.000 --> 04:48:34.788 align:start position:0%
 
to

04:48:34.788 --> 04:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:48:36.868 --> 04:48:36.878 align:start position:0%
okay we all want to get out of here so
 
04:48:38.628 --> 04:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
maybe we have just go around the table
 
04:48:39.910 --> 04:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
and sort of
 
04:48:42.430 --> 04:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
get this bill right here I don't think
 
04:48:44.390 --> 04:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
for me adds up to the importance of the
 
04:48:46.390 --> 04:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
other bills we're doing but but it's
 
04:48:50.310 --> 04:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
important I know it it's
 
04:48:53.510 --> 04:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
money so represent
 
04:48:57.190 --> 04:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
Dr so a vote now would be to just send
 
04:48:59.910 --> 04:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
it the way it is to our committee is
 
04:48:59.920 --> 04:49:00.788 align:start position:0%
it the way it is to our committee is
that

04:49:00.788 --> 04:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:49:04.708 --> 04:49:04.718 align:start position:0%
correct yeah okay and when would we
 
04:49:06.590 --> 04:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
address the fact that there are other
 
04:49:08.990 --> 04:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
times that a negative tax rate can be
 
04:49:11.230 --> 04:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
set that don't have to do with education
 
04:49:13.110 --> 04:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
funding I I didn't hear you I'm sorry
 
04:49:15.868 --> 04:49:15.878 align:start position:0%
there's this says prohibits tax uh Dr
 
04:49:18.030 --> 04:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
from setting negative local and County
 
04:49:19.590 --> 04:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
tax rates on real property and we just
 
04:49:22.110 --> 04:49:22.120 align:start position:0%
heard last time that there are cases
 
04:49:24.628 --> 04:49:24.638 align:start position:0%
where that happens organically that have
 
04:49:32.670 --> 04:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:35.230 --> 04:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
swept we didn't talk about that we had
 
04:49:37.270 --> 04:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
Dr talks somewhat about it at the
 
04:49:38.708 --> 04:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
initial part I don't know if we're going
 
04:49:41.670 --> 04:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
to fix that here in this policy that's
 
04:49:43.548 --> 04:49:43.558 align:start position:0%
thatly why I'm saying so just send it on
 
04:49:45.910 --> 04:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
to our committee and me then just send
 
04:49:47.310 --> 04:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
it on to our I think we need to send
 
04:49:49.030 --> 04:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
this right just to the committee and let
 
04:49:50.430 --> 04:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
the committee as a whole make a
 
04:49:52.190 --> 04:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation on this one okay
 
04:49:53.390 --> 04:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to be voting what
 
04:49:55.548 --> 04:49:55.558 align:start position:0%
their Community wants them to
 
04:49:58.830 --> 04:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
vote and I I I think for us to try and
 
04:50:01.070 --> 04:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
do something right now is that we'll
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
just bring it to the back to the
 
04:50:04.510 --> 04:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
education committee and say there was no
 
04:50:06.670 --> 04:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation from the committee we'll
 
04:50:08.430 --> 04:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
open up that great discussion there and
 
04:50:10.510 --> 04:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
sit there for three or four hours
 
04:50:10.520 --> 04:50:12.750 align:start position:0%
sit there for three or four hours
discussing

04:50:12.750 --> 04:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
discussing
 
04:50:19.230 --> 04:50:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:21.470 --> 04:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
and I don't know where it's going to end
 
04:50:23.590 --> 04:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
up I have no idea where that's going to
 
04:50:27.230 --> 04:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
end up I'm sort of betwix and between it
 
04:50:29.230 --> 04:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
myself yeah I'm coming from one of those
 
04:50:31.830 --> 04:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
property poor towns but I don't like the
 
04:50:33.230 --> 04:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
idea of taking money away from the
 
04:50:34.390 --> 04:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
community either if they're really
 
04:50:38.788 --> 04:50:38.798 align:start position:0%
basing their their income and attracting
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
business as a result of uh having lower
 
04:50:49.708 --> 04:50:49.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:52.868 --> 04:50:52.878 align:start position:0%
not collect money that goes up for the
 
04:50:52.878 --> 04:50:54.750 align:start position:0%
not collect money that goes up for the
pluming

04:50:54.750 --> 04:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
pluming
 
04:50:57.230 --> 04:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
bridge I know it when I lived over in
 
04:50:58.628 --> 04:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
Maine that's where do you think they got
 
04:51:01.030 --> 04:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
all their money from Cape Elizabeth
 
04:51:03.030 --> 04:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
where they had the power plant and
 
04:51:05.230 --> 04:51:05.240 align:start position:0%
spread that all over the
 
04:51:09.628 --> 04:51:09.638 align:start position:0%
state what a common good we call CBR
 
04:51:13.990 --> 04:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
seabook yes seab Brook here okay well I
 
04:51:16.628 --> 04:51:16.638 align:start position:0%
don't I think we've made recommendations
 
04:51:17.788 --> 04:51:17.798 align:start position:0%
that as far as we're going to go with
 
04:51:19.190 --> 04:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
this committee and I I want to thank
 
04:51:20.590 --> 04:51:20.600 align:start position:0%
