00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
so i just i want to start by
 
00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
giving just a little bit of an overview
 
00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
and some background on how we got here
 
00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:28.150 align:start position:0%
and some background on how we got here
today

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 align:start position:0%
um as you know
 
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
this past session the legislature
 
00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 align:start position:0%
enacted house bill 1677 which
 
00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
established the ydc settlement fund
 
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
and as part of that bill this office was
 
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
directed to develop a a claims process
 
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
and guidelines
 
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh which includes claim forms uh process
 
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
and rules for how this
 
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
this um this process would work and
 
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines for how we would value claims
 
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
and payout claims
 
00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
so that is what we have done we
 
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
submitted that
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
to the lba who's given it to you
 
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
and the fiscal committee
 
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.790 align:start position:0%
and the fiscal committee
is

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
has the role under this bill of either
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
approving the process or
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
objecting or giving not approving the
 
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
process and giving us some feedback on
 
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
concerns that then we would we would
 
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
take into account and and come back with
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
revisions to address
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
so that that is why we are here today
 
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
the fund that is set up by ht hb 1677 as
 
00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
we've talked about since january and the
 
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
process that this bill sets up
 
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
it is intended to provide an alternative
 
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.550 align:start position:0%
it is intended to provide an alternative
option

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
option
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
for victims who may have suffered sexual
 
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
or physical abuse while residents at ydc
 
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
or or
 
00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
or a facility that was under another
 
00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:49.749 align:start position:0%
or a facility that was under another
name

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 align:start position:0%
name
 
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
that that's a similar facility
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
we felt that it was important to set up
 
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
a process like this because as we've
 
00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
talked about now a lot
 
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
the traditional litigation process can
 
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
be very difficult for anyone
 
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
but it can be especially difficult for
 
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
those who may have been victims of
 
00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse or physical abuse
 
00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
especially when that abuse occurred
 
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
while the victim was a child
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
so our goal when we brought this forward
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
to the legislature and as we work
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
through the legislative process
 
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
was to establish this as an alternative
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
to traditional litigation
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
as i've stated before and as you all
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
know there's another part of our office
 
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
that continues to
 
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:32.950 align:start position:0%
that continues to
inve

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
inve
 
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
conduct a criminal investigation into
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
the allegations of abuse at ydc
 
00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
um to date we've indicted 11 former
 
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
state employees
 
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.110 align:start position:0%
state employees
for

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
the alligator for for um offenses
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
related to the allegations brought
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
forward by 22 victims so since the end
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
of the legislative session we have now
 
00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
brought criminal charges for two
 
00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:55.510 align:start position:0%
brought criminal charges for two
additional

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
victims allegations and we we
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
continue to investigate we expect that
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
that investigation will continue for
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
some time probably years
 
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
most of those trials have now been
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
scheduled the first trial is scheduled
 
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
for january of 2023 in the criminal
 
00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:15.919 align:start position:0%
cases uh scheduled for january of 2023
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
they run through may of 2024 there are a
 
00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
couple of cases which have yet to be
 
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
scheduled for trial but we expect those
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
to be scheduled for trial soon so
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
we will have a lot of criminal trials in
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
these cases running through 2023 and
 
00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:33.269 align:start position:0%
these cases running through 2023 and
2024.

00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
as required by the the statute we have
 
00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:40.959 align:start position:0%
made what i believe are absolutely good
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
faith efforts to negotiate this package
 
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
with claimants counsel
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
we started by circulating first drafts
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
back in june
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
we we posted those drafts on our website
 
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
we sent these drafts to all claimants
 
00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
council that we were aware of
 
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
we sent notices out to the entire bar
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that every attorney in
 
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
the state was aware that this was
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
happening so that we could make sure
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
that that we were notifying anyone who
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
could potentially have a a client that
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
might come through this process that
 
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
they had the opportunity to engage with
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
our office in the development
 
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
of this package
 
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
um part of the benefit of posting the
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
the drafts on the website
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
is that that also
 
00:09:25.839 --> 00:09:26.630 align:start position:0%
is that that also
get

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
that also gave the ability for the
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
public to see where we were going with
 
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
this so we wanted to be very transparent
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
we wanted everyone to see how this was
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
evolving in real time up to
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
our final draft that we have submitted
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
to you
 
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.509 align:start position:0%
to you
today

00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
for the most part i will say claimants
 
00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
council have chosen not to engage in the
 
00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:46.389 align:start position:0%
council have chosen not to engage in the
process

00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
that that's their decision it's their
 
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
right to do so i will say it's somewhat
 
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
disappointing from my perspective that
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
we haven't gotten more engagement from
 
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
claimants counsel but
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
we have made
 
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
every effort to to facilitate that
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
engagement we've offered in-person
 
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.269 align:start position:0%
engagement we've offered in-person
meetings

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
we've offered to sit down with anyone
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
who wanted to talk about this process so
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
so i think that we have really made
 
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
some extensive efforts on that front
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
the statute or the bill that was passed
 
00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:17.839 align:start position:0%
also directed our office to consult with
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
our victim witness advocates and we have
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
done that
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
a great deal
 
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
of the difference between the first
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
drafts and the drafts that
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
you see before you today is due to the
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
input from our victim witness advocates
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
they've given us great feedback they've
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
given us great ideas on how to simplify
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
this process as much as we can
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
and i just want to take the opportunity
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
to publicly acknowledge and thank them
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
for their efforts and their input
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
they have a different role in our office
 
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
so their role is has always been and and
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
is today
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
focused on assisting and supporting
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
victims so so they gave us great
 
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.430 align:start position:0%
victims so so they gave us great
feedback

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
feedback
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
they understand that this is a this
 
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
process is a balance between
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
making this as simple and easy for
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
victims as it can be while also
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
providing for appropriate
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
factual review and verification so i
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
think they understand that balance and
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
they understand that um that we're
 
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
trying to walk that line and we have a
 
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
real needle to threat
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
i know that this package as it appears
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
before you today may seem somewhat
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
daunting especially as we try to view
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
this package from the perspective of an
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
average person
 
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
or an unrepresented victim who may come
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
through this process
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
so i just want to i want to note a
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
couple things on that front and i'm sure
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of conversation about that
 
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.790 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of conversation about that
today

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
first i think it's important to note
 
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.590 align:start position:0%
first i think it's important to note
that

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
much of this material is not material
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
that that a victim or a claimant would
 
00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:56.959 align:start position:0%
need to be going through themselves
 
00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
part of the package you have are the
 
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
claims process and the guidelines
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
those serve as sort of the governing
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
rules behind this process which
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
really will be governing the conduct of
 
00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
the administrator the conduct of the
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
attorney general designee the conduct of
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
claimants counsel and governing how the
 
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
claims are valued
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
a victim or a claimant is not going to
 
00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
be required to sift through all of that
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
that's one important thing to note
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
a second important thing to note is that
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of claimants or
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
potential claimants that we are aware of
 
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
are represented by council and when i
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
say vast majority i mean you know
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
percentages in the high 90s we're i'm
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
not sure we're aware of of anyone beyond
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
one or two individuals who we
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
as of now
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
we know of who would come through this
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
process without an attorney so i just
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
think that's important to be aware of we
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely cannot assume that anyone
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
that anyone and everyone who would come
 
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
through this process will have a lawyer
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
but i think we can be pretty confident
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
that the vast majority
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
of those who come through this process
 
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.190 align:start position:0%
of those who come through this process
will

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:09.910 align:start position:0%
will
so

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
from my perspective that that has played
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
a role in our thinking in the balance
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
between trying to keep this simple
 
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
streamlined and digestible while also
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we would collect enough
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
something else to keep in mind is that
 
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
an unrepresented victim who comes
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
through this process is going to
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
experience this process in a different
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
way than than we're experiencing
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
experiencing it here today as we
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
go through all of these documents
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of this committee
 
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
evaluating whether to approve the
 
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.350 align:start position:0%
evaluating whether to approve the
documents

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
documents
 
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
i think if an unrepresented victim comes
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
to this process they'll come to it by
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
seeing either an ad or a notice that
 
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
goes out
 
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
they'll hear about it by word of mouth
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
they'll see it online they'll see the
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
contact information for the
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
administrator's office and they
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
if they're not reaching out to a lawyer
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
to help take them through the process
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
they'll be reaching out to the
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
administrator's office
 
00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:14.959 align:start position:0%
and we expect that that office will be
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
set up in such a way that they will
 
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
give victims not they won't just drop up
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
the package on a victim or a claimant
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
and say here it is you know
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
fill it out and send it in and
 
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
and we'll we'll get back to you they
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
will not experience this process in a
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
way that you experience other processes
 
00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.030 align:start position:0%
way that you experience other processes
where

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
you fill something out and if you leave
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
one thing blank it just gets kicked back
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
to you
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
with uh you know
 
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
not complete please complete right
 
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
they'll get simple straightforward
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
responses from the administrator's
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
office and
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
we intend and we expect
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
and i think it's reflected in these
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
documents that the administrator's
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
office will provide assistance to
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
claimants in filling out this packet the
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
administrator's office will
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
not kick back a a claim form because
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's incomplete they will accept the
 
00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.269 align:start position:0%
it's incomplete they will accept the
form

00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
and they will reach out to the claimant
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
to offer and provide assistance in
 
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.030 align:start position:0%
to offer and provide assistance in
getting

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
enough information into that claim form
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
so that the claim can be evaluated
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
i think this is really important because
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
as i've talked
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
with especially with our victim witness
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
any individual victim could have or
 
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
there is a wide variety of of ways in
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
which any potential victim might
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
interact with a process like this you
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
can have
 
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
you have a spectrum that runs anywhere
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
from someone who is barely able to get
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
get a few sentences down on paper to
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
someone who
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
is ready to fill out the entire form and
 
00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:56.970 align:start position:0%
you have to be ready to
 
00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:58.230 align:start position:0%
you have to be ready to

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.110 align:start position:0%
[Music]
to

00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
assist and work with a wide range of
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
victims on that front
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
but we can't we also can't assume
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
anything about individual victims we we
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
can't assume that any one victim may not
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
be able to fill this out we can't assume
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
that any one victim may be able to fill
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
it out so
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
this is this is a challenge for us and
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
one that we are aware of and we've
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
worked very hard to try to to try to
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
accommodate that we will have a wide
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
range of individuals who might come
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
through this process
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
we also expect and we've had
 
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
conversations with the administrative
 
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
office of the courts on this front who
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
will be responsible for helping set up
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure for the
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
administrator's office
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
we expect that this that the claim form
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
in the worksheet will be made available
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
through a website format so that a
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
claimant or victim would have the option
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
of filling this out
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
on a website
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
the advantage of that which you'll see
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
as we walk through the documents is that
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
the claim form for instance that you
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
have before you is
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
especially long because it is intended
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
all of the potential
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
information you might have to fill out
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
for any situation that you might that
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
that you might be under as a victim
 
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.870 align:start position:0%
that you might be under as a victim
so

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
you'll notice in the form it'll say
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
things like if you filled out this part
 
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
you don't have to fill out that part if
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
you filled out that part you don't have
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
to fill out this part
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
if you are claiming this then you don't
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
have to fill out that
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
the paper form has to lay all of that
 
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.029 align:start position:0%
the paper form has to lay all of that
out

00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
but the webs the web option
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
will be much simpler for a claimant for
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
a victim because it will automatically
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
direct them
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
through depending on what they've put
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
into the to the fields so i think having
 
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
that option available will be
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
will be helpful and will help to
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
streamline this process even more
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
for a claimant who who is unrepresented
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
and maybe is accessing this through the
 
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.190 align:start position:0%
and maybe is accessing this through the
website

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
again we obviously have to have paper
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
forms because we can't assume that any
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
claimant would have access would have
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
internet access or access to a computer
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
but but having that option available i
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
the last piece i just want to note is
 
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.470 align:start position:0%
the last piece i just want to note is
that

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
you'll notice in our in our request for
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
approval that whether this is approved
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
today or or down the line we've we've
 
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
requested approval to make
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
non-substantive changes going forward
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
that would just enhance readability
 
00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.909 align:start position:0%
that would just enhance readability
um

00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:35.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
enhance readability and make make this
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
process easier to follow so an example
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
of that would be
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
putting in more places on the form this
 
00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
is where you call for assistance or
 
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
putting moving to the front
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
bold lettering that says this is where
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
you go for assistance and just making
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
clear where people need to go to access
 
00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
assistance with with completing this
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
process if they need it
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
i would just say that i think what's
 
00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:11.919 align:start position:0%
important for today and what what is
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
really the meat
 
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.549 align:start position:0%
really the meat
of

00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
of what this committee needs to be
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
is the substance of the documents so how
 
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
are the claims going to be handled
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
how are they going to be valued
 
00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.430 align:start position:0%
how are they going to be valued
um

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
what processes are being put in place to
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
ensure that claims are being valued
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
fairly and that similar situated
 
00:19:32.799 --> 00:19:34.070 align:start position:0%
fairly and that similar situated
claimants

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
claimants
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
would get similar
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
values for their claims out of this
 
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.310 align:start position:0%
values for their claims out of this
process

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
i think that's all consistent with our
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
goal of providing an alternative
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
option to traditional litigation that is
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
easier and more victim
 
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
friendly and trauma informed than
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
traditional litigation
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
while recognizing that
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
there will still be some level of
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
process that that has to come along with
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
this because we all we do have an
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
obligation i think at the end of the day
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we're we're
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
conducting enough
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
enough of a review to verify facts and
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
verify the information we're getting
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
so that we can be sure we're paying out
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
claims fairly i think that's not that
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
doesn't come just from an obligation to
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer not to pay out money
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
inappropriately it comes from an
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
obligation to be fair we want
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
to do everything we can
 
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.110 align:start position:0%
to do everything we can
to

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:32.799 align:start position:0%
to ensure that
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
people who may have experienced
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
one form of abuse or another
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
are receiving the same compensation as
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
those who who experience similar abuse
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:45.919 --> 00:20:46.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
with that i will
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
i'll turn to the documents specifically
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
but just say one more thing about what
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
what how we have sort of internalized
 
00:20:59.230 --> 00:20:59.240 align:start position:0%
what we think is the intent of hb6
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
1677 and how that's reflected in these
 
00:21:01.679 --> 00:21:04.310 align:start position:0%
1677 and how that's reflected in these
documents

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:06.029 --> 00:21:06.039 align:start position:0%
we've always viewed the intent of hp
 
00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:08.559 align:start position:0%
1677 again as as providing an
 
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
alternative to traditional litigation
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
and we view the directive in this
 
00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:13.990 align:start position:0%
and we view the directive in this
legislation

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
to us
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
as one that asks us to balance again
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
the obligation to provide
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
compensation to victims through an
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
accessible process that balances that
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
obligation with the obligation that we
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
have to the taxpayers and the people of
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
the state to make sure this is fair and
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh that we pay out money appropriately
 
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
so that overall is sort of the exercise
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
that we're going here it's going for
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
here it's a little bit of a needle to
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
thread and
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
as we've said before and i think we all
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
recognize this is this is unprecedented
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
i think that it is great that the state
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
is doing this but we have never done
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
anything like this before and to our
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge no state has ever done
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
anything like this before so we are
 
00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.470 align:start position:0%
anything like this before so we are
treading

00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
treading
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
new ground i think we're um i think
 
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
we're treading new ground in a good way
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
but because of that you know i think
 
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
this process warrants warrants the care
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
and and due diligence and work that has
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
sorry turned off my microphone
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
with that i will turn to the documents
 
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.590 align:start position:0%
with that i will turn to the documents
specifically

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919 align:start position:0%
the package you have is about 89 pages
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
but it really breaks down into three
 
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.430 align:start position:0%
but it really breaks down into three
parts

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
parts
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
the first part is the claims process
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
this part
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
just high level it tracks the statute
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
for the most part but it also fills in
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
details and gaps that the statute may
 
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
not have filled in
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
so this is the piece of the of the
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
package that provides for the procedures
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
that are to be followed by the claimant
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
the administrator and the ag designee as
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
the claim moves through the process
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
this process is uh or this document is
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
designed to be posted publicly
 
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
we expect that there might be updates
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
and additions from time to time
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
depending on how this goes the hb 16
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
1677 does provide that the administrator
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
consulting with claimants council and
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
the ag could come back to fiscal to
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
propose revisions to the process so we
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
would expect that that that may happen
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
once the administrator is appointed and
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
sort of takes control of this
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
the second piece and i will go through
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
these in more detail but i'm just
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
summarizing each piece the second piece
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
that you have
 
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
which really starts on page 21 are the
 
00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.149 align:start position:0%
which really starts on page 21 are the
guidelines

00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
the guidelines are the first appendix to
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
the claims process and the guidelines
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
deal specifically
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
with how to value claims so the claims
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
process deals with procedure
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
the guidelines deal with how to value
 
00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
the claims
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
so as the statute requires the
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
guidelines group claims into categories
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
by type
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
so type of abuse
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
aggravating factors and mitigating
 
00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:05.750 align:start position:0%
aggravating factors and mitigating
factors

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
factors
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
this is the document this is the the
 
00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
piece of this package that assigns the
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
there's some discretion for the
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
administrator when it comes to valuation
 
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the day the
 
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.630 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the day the
administrator

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
is going to retain a certain amount of
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
discretion as to how to apply mitigating
 
00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.950 align:start position:0%
discretion as to how to apply mitigating
factors

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
factors
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
but for the most part we've tried to
 
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
keep the guidelines fairly formulaic
 
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the day
 
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
the bill that was passed
 
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
directs that the guidelines the goal of
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
the guidelines is to ensure the fair and
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
uniform valuation of claims
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
so that the claims of similarly situated
 
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
claimants are valued similarly
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
so basically that's just a way of saying
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
the goal of the guidelines is to ensure
 
00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
fairness and the best way to do that or
 
00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559 align:start position:0%
i should say
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
the way we do that when you have
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
potentially hundreds of claimants coming
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
through a process is to have a process
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
that frankly is somewhat formulaic
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
because only by having
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
a formula be the base of evaluation
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
process can you ensure fairness if you
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
leave too much discretion to the
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
administrator you risk having
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies in how claims are valued
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
and then the last
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
piece of this that you have is the
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
claims packet
 
00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:23.430 align:start position:0%
claims packet
this

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
consists of a number of items and this
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
is what a claimant or a victim will
 
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
really be going through and filling out
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
with either assistance from their
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
attorney or assistance from staff uh the
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
administrator's staff
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
so that was just an overview of the
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
three documents i will now
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
proceed into going into some greater
 
00:25:43.679 --> 00:25:45.190 align:start position:0%
proceed into going into some greater
detail

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
detail
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
i'm going to keep this somewhat high
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
level only because there is a lot here
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
i don't want to you know spend two hours
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
going through the details of everything
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
here but but i'll keep it high level and
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
then we will be prepared to take any
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
questions you may have
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
as a first just housekeeping item you'll
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
notice that
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
at the top left
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
are page numbers and these are meant to
 
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
be sort of page numbers for the whole
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
package so when i refer to a page number
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be referring
 
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
to what's in the top hand corner where
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
so again the claims process which is
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
found on pages 1 through 20 of your
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
packet referencing the top left corner
 
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
again this
 
00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.549 align:start position:0%
again this
this

00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
is sort of the rules of the road
 
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.390 align:start position:0%
is sort of the rules of the road
procedure-wise

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
procedure-wise
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
so this this process governs how the
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
administrator the aeg designee the
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
claimant claimants counsel are to
 
00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.510 align:start position:0%
claimant claimants counsel are to
proceed

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
on a procedural basis
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
this process basically has three
 
00:26:57.919 --> 00:26:59.669 align:start position:0%
this process basically has three
components

00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
components
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
it describes
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
how you go about submitting and
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
completing a claim
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
so filling out the form
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
interact attaching necessary documents
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
interacting with the administrator
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
and so on
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
it also
 
00:27:20.399 --> 00:27:21.269 align:start position:0%
it also
um

00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
deals with the ag designee's review and
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
position that's the second component of
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
the claims process so once a form
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
once a claim is submitted once a claim
 
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
is complete or i should say complete
 
00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.549 align:start position:0%
is complete or i should say complete
enough

00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
the aeg designee has a chance to review
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
it and give a position
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
and then this process outlines
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
and it a resolution proceeding before
 
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
the administrator
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
if we get that far
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
so again to summarize phase one
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
deals with how a claimant pulls together
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
what they need
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
to submit a claim deals with how a
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
claimant fills out the claim form we
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
provided a claim form for this which
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
we'll go through when we get to the
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
claims packet and a list of items that
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
need to be submitted
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
again if something is submitted that's
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
incomplete that's fine
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
we envision that there could be
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
claimants who are not represented by
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
counsel who may submit a form that only
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
has a couple pieces of information on it
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
as long as their name and contact
 
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
information is on the form we would
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
envision that if that happens there
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
the form will not or the claim form will
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
not be rejected it will be accepted and
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
there will be outreach to that claimant
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
to assist them
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
with how to complete the form at least
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
complete it to enough of a point that we
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
as part of that
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
you know there are details that remain
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
to be worked out with the administrator
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
once the administrator is appointed but
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
we would envision that
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
the administrator would have staff but
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
also that the administrator may make
 
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:03.919 align:start position:0%
contract with
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
with an organization that provides that
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
could provide assistance um using using
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
trained advocates we recognize that that
 
00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.510 align:start position:0%
trained advocates we recognize that that
a

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
secretary while well
 
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
or an executive assistant while
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
qualified to do many tasks may not be
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
um perfectly positioned to assist a
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
victim of sexual abuse with filling out
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
a claim form so we we envision that the
 
00:29:25.279 --> 00:29:26.710 align:start position:0%
a claim form so we we envision that the
administrator

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
will will
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
contract with an appropriate
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
organization to provide that type of
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
assistance if needed
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
once a claim
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
is submitted
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
the process provides that it moves to
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
the aeg designees review so a claim is
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
submitted and then the
 
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
ag designee who will be somebody in our
 
00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.630 align:start position:0%
ag designee who will be somebody in our
office

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
will conduct an initial review of the
 
00:29:50.559 --> 00:29:52.149 align:start position:0%
will conduct an initial review of the
claim

00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
claim
 
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
as part of that review they'll review
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
the information that's submitted on the
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
claim form
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
they will
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
review any documents that our office
 
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
might have or have access to review
 
00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.590 align:start position:0%
might have or have access to review
records

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
to make a determination
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
as to what what the our office's
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
position would be on a claim we
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
envisioned that it may very well be that
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
that we'll have claims where we review
 
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
it we think there's enough information
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
there we think what's there is credible
 
00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
and we would take the position that the
 
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
claim should be paid out in full
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
depending um whatever the amount was
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
there also could be a situation where we
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
review a claim and we
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
we think that more information is needed
 
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
and we would request
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
the administrator to appoint an
 
00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:43.039 align:start position:0%
investigator to investigate the claim
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
so that could be part of that step
 
00:30:45.039 --> 00:30:45.909 align:start position:0%
so that could be part of that step
that

00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
our office reviews the claim and
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
requests an investigation
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's then up to the administrator to
 
00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
either refer the claim to investigation
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
so that decision will not be made by our
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
office that decision as to whether to
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
refer the claim for an investigation
 
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
will be made by the administrator
 
00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.590 align:start position:0%
will be made by the administrator
but

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
if a decision is made to refer a claim
 
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
to an investigator
 
00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
that will only be to help
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
help collect additional information that
 
00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
we think is needed that's not to
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
put pressure on a victim it's not to
 
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.070 align:start position:0%
put pressure on a victim it's not to
um

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
to make a victim feel as if they're
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
they're being overly scrutinized it's
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
it's for information collection because
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
a very important piece of this is
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
collecting sufficient information to
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
we considered and ultimately thought it
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
was not a good idea but we considered
 
00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:47.519 align:start position:0%
the option of of proposing that every
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
claim be referred to an investigator
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
we ultimately thought that that that was
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
not necessary and not a good way to go
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
because we think some claims may very
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
well be simple enough that no
 
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
investigation is needed
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
we think that
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
the aeg designee should review a claim
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
first before
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
deciding whether to request an
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
investigation because
 
00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:11.430 align:start position:0%
investigation because
again

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
an investigation may not be needed but
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
also if the ag designee has first
 
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
reviewed a claim
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
they'll be in a good position to focus
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
any investigator on on where to go with
 
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
with an investigation into a claim
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
finally the other reason we didn't think
 
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
an investigation was needed for every
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
claim is that
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
again in most cases claimants council
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
will be represented or claimants will be
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
represented by council and we would
 
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
expect that
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
you know as part of earning the fee that
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
they would get out of this the
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
claimant's council will be providing
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
significant assistance to a claimant in
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
filling out the claim form with all of
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
the information that may be needed
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
there are mechanisms built in throughout
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
the first phase that
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
that provide for extra time
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
if the administrator
 
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
feels that there needs to be extra time
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
so you'll notice through the process
 
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
there are various deadlines provided you
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
know submit a claim there's a certain
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
amount of time to determine whether a
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
claim is complete
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
if more information is requested from
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
the claimant the claimant has certain a
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
certain amount of time to to provide
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
that information all of those deadlines
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
that are in here can be extended by the
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
administrator for good cause we thought
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
that was important because
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
any claim could be different and the
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
administrator should have some
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
discretion to allow for more time to
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
phase two of of the claims process
 
00:33:43.039 --> 00:33:44.230 align:start position:0%
phase two of of the claims process
involves

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
involves
 
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
so once everything is submitted
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
any investigations have been completed
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
the aeg designee reviews a claim and
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
indicates their position
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
that could be anywhere from the aeg
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
designee reviews a claim and indicates
 
00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.430 align:start position:0%
designee reviews a claim and indicates
that

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
the claim should be approved in full
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
the ag designee may say
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
okay we think there's sufficient
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
information here maybe not sufficient
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
information here so we think only part
 
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
of the claim should be approved
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
or that the claim should be denied
 
00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:23.109 align:start position:0%
or that the claim should be denied
entirely

00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
the process is designed so that that
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
determination or that that position of
 
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%
the ag designee can be modified if
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
additional information comes in
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
but but the goal is for
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
the aeg designee to be able to take that
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
first um
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
take that first step
 
00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.149 align:start position:0%
take that first step
in

00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
in making a determination as to whether
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
a claim should be approved the idea
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
behind this is that
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
is that this process is set up in such a
 
00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
way as directed by the bill that it
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
starts out as a negotiation
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
a a negotiation that is that
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
comes through facilitation of the
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
collection of information but it starts
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
out as a negotiation between the aeg
 
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.510 align:start position:0%
out as a negotiation between the aeg
designee

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
designee
 
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
if the ag designee ultimately takes a
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
position that the claimant does not
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
agree with
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's when you get to
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
phase three where
 
00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.310 align:start position:0%
phase three where
the

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.390 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
the claimant will have three options
 
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
if the claimant agrees
 
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
has agreed with the ag designee's
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
position then that will be
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
that will end the process and the
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
claimant will will get paid out either
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
all of their claim or part of their
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
claim uh depending on what the aeg
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
designee has agreed to
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
if the claimant does not agree with the
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
ag designee's position and this is
 
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.150 align:start position:0%
ag designee's position and this is
important

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
at that point the claimant has the
 
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
option to exit the process entirely
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
and continue to litigate
 
00:35:55.829 --> 00:35:55.839 align:start position:0%
so that that's an issue that's been
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
discussed and i think bandied about a
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
in the discussion of this process
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
a claimant is not required to give up
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
their rights to litigate to enter this
 
00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:06.870 align:start position:0%
their rights to litigate to enter this
process

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
a claimant can go all the way through
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
the submission of the claim form the
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
review of the aeg designee the
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
discussion with the aeg designee as to
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
what the aeg designee thinks about their
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
claim they can go all the way through
 
00:36:19.599 --> 00:36:20.390 align:start position:0%
claim they can go all the way through
that

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
and only if they get to the point where
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
they realize that they're not going to
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
be able to come to agreement with the
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
aeg designee
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
do they have to face the decision of
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
whether to exit the process and go to
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
court or
 
00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:38.079 align:start position:0%
take this process into phase three
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
which is where the administrator
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
which would be the scheduling of a
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
resolution proceeding before the
 
00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.790 align:start position:0%
resolution proceeding before the
administrator

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
so basically at that point a claimant is
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
able to say
 
00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.589 align:start position:0%
able to say
okay

00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
i don't have an agreement here on a
 
00:36:51.359 --> 00:36:52.870 align:start position:0%
i don't have an agreement here on a
settlement

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
i can either take my chances and
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
and um argue my case in front of the
 
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
administrator within the caps provided
 
00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
by the bill
 
00:37:01.359 --> 00:37:02.870 align:start position:0%
by the bill
or

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
i can go back to court i can exit this
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
process and take my case to court the
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
advantage obviously of going before the
 
00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
administrator is that that will that
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
will be a much shorter process than
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
going to court but the claimant will
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
have that option
 
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
so a claimant can go pretty far through
 
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
this process without ever having waived
 
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
their right to litigate i think that's
 
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
important because i think i think it's
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
just important for the committee to
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
understand that a claimant does not
 
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
waive their rights to go to court to
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
so if a claimant does
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
elect to go forward
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh and and have a resolution proceeding
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
in front of the uh the the administrator
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
the claims processes we've laid out here
 
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh it leaves a fair amount to be
 
00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
ultimately be set up by the
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
administrator because we felt that
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
whoever the administrator is is going to
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
need to have some discretion in how they
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
want to set up a resolution proceeding
 
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
but the statute does provide that
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
the maximum length of a hearing would be
 
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
three hours
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
and the statute does provide that
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
claimant can have their their attorney
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
present and that the claimant can
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
request the opportunity to to speak
 
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
with the with the administrator
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
and then there's a decision within 30
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
days of the hearing
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
so we've admittedly left this somewhat
 
00:38:28.079 --> 00:38:28.950 align:start position:0%
so we've admittedly left this somewhat
open

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
because we we think it's a good idea for
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
the administrator to have some
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
discretion in how they would set up
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
after a decision by the administrator
 
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
or i should say a decision by the
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
administrator is binding it's not
 
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
appealable but there is an opportunity
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
for parties to request that the
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
administrator correct any errors so if
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
there are any mathematical errors made
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
or any other sort of clear errors
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity to request that
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
the administrator correct those errors
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
so that is that's a high level overview
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
of the claims process again it largely
 
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
tracks the statute but it it's meant to
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
fill in some details that the statute
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't provide um because as we just as
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
we were discussing as the legislative
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
legislative process went along
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
um it would have been impossible i think
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
to provide every detail in the bill we
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
knew that we were going to have to leave
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
so the second piece of this as i
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned before
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
are the valuation guidelines
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
and again this this piece of the package
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
really governs how to value claims so
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
the claims process was the procedure how
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
you submit a claim how it gets reviewed
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
how the parties negotiate and have an
 
00:39:57.359 --> 00:39:58.870 align:start position:0%
how the parties negotiate and have an
exchange

00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
exchange
 
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
how the administrator schedules a
 
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:02.079 align:start position:0%
resolution proceeding that was the
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
claims process
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
the guidelines govern how to how to
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
value a claim
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
so again
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
the goal of these guidelines is to
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
ensure that
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
that claims are valued fairly and that
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
similar similarly situated claimants
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
receive a similar amount of compensation
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
because of that these guidelines as
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
you'll see are pretty formulaic
 
00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:29.670 align:start position:0%
you'll see are pretty formulaic
um

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
you know it it bears noting that
 
00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.069 align:start position:0%
you know it it bears noting that
that

00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
there is some difficulty with the idea
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
of a formula
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
of using a formula to try to put a value
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
on harm someone might have suffered
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
because of sexual abuse or physical
 
00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.589 align:start position:0%
because of sexual abuse or physical
abuse

00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's a difficult concept for us
 
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
i think that's a difficult concept for
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
anyone to wrap their head around
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
i've said this before and i'll say it
 
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
again today i think the reality is there
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
there is no amount of money
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
that can compensate truly compensate
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
someone who has suffered
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
some of the horrific abuse we we've
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
heard about there's there's no
 
00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
amount of money that i think is the
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
right amount of money
 
00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.109 align:start position:0%
right amount of money
so

00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
with that said
 
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
there is an importance i think
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
in in being fair
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
and again when we have when we know we
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
could potentially have hundreds of
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
claimants coming through this process
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
even if they don't all come through it
 
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.190 align:start position:0%
even if they don't all come through it
initially

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
initially
 
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
eventually hundreds of claimants coming
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
through this process the best way to
 
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
ensure fairness is is using a formula at
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
least as the as the base of how we value
 
00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:46.829 align:start position:0%
least as the as the base of how we value
claims

00:41:46.829 --> 00:41:46.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
so with that in mind the guidelines are
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
are kind of organized according to the
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
steps that are taken in the claim
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
worksheet which we'll talk about when we
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
get to the claim packet
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
so there's a few steps
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
that you go through
 
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
the first thing you do in valuing a
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
claim according to this process is you
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
determine a base award
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see listed there the base awards
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
for sexual abuse
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
a question i think some of you have and
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's a natural question is
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
where did these numbers come from
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
and there's a couple points on that
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
first as we talked about during the
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
we in our office have done extensive
 
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
research to try to determine
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
what the average
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
settlement amounts have been around the
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
country for claims related to sexual
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.190 align:start position:0%
 
for

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
we continue to update our research but
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
but broadly speaking we ultimately
 
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:01.839 align:start position:0%
pinpointed an average of between six
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand and eight hundred
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per claimant
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh our original average was closer to
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand dollars but as we
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
had discussions with claimants council
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
and looked at cases that they suggested
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
we look at
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
we ultimately included some of the cases
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
they suggested we didn't include others
 
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
depending on our evaluation of how
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
similar those cases were but
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately our average landed in the six
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand to eight hundred
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar range
 
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
so one of the ways we
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
selected these numbers was to take
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
all of the information we know at this
 
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
time about the population
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
of claimants that is out there
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
and do some very rough modeling
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
based on their allegations to determine
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
what these numbers should be
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
to land this process in the right
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
average range so that's one of the
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
things we did admittedly there's no
 
00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
certain way to do this we only have
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
limited information
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
and there's no way to model this exactly
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
there's a there's an estimation exercise
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
that runs through all of this but that's
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things we did to arrive at
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
these numbers
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
the second thing we did um is we
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
considered the numbers that were used in
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
negotiations we had had with claimants
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
counsel before the legislative process
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
ever began
 
00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
so as i noted during the legislative
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
process we had many
 
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
we had many exchanges with claimants
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
counsel regarding a potential way to
 
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
develop a settlement mechanism for these
 
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
cases and that included
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
this type of matrix i'll call it a
 
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
for the categories of sexual abuse the
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
numbers are within the range of those
 
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%
numbers that were being discussed
 
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm limited in what i can tell you on
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
that because we
 
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
we had agreed to confidentiality in
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
those settlement discussions but i do
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
think it's important for this committee
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
to know
 
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.190 align:start position:0%
to know
that

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
the per incident numbers that were
 
00:45:09.119 --> 00:45:11.109 align:start position:0%
the per incident numbers that were
discussed

00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
00:45:11.119 --> 00:45:12.069 align:start position:0%
discussed
were

00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
were with or i should say these numbers
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
here are within the range of the per
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
incident numbers that we had discussed
 
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
with claimants council in our
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
discussions before we ever got to the
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
so those are really the two kind of the
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
two major
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
things we considered in arriving at
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
these numbers
 
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
for physical abuse
 
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
the the average
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
award or settlement that we were able to
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
pinpoint through our research was
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
roughly sixty thousand dollars
 
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
that's what helped us
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
arrive at a cap of 150 000 during the
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
so again we went through the same
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
exercise when
 
00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
when developing these per incident
 
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
numbers we tried to use the information
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
that we do know about the population and
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
do some very rough modeling
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
um to arrive at numbers that would land
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
so i just i wanted to give you a little
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
bit of an explanation there on how we
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
arrived at the numbers we arrived at
 
00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
that that explanation sort of flows
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
through this entire process so when we
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
go through
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
the the aggravating factors and the
 
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
multipliers associated that
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
that all ties back to what i just talked
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
about trying to kind of
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
um base it on the rough modeling of
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
using the information we know
 
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
about this population in order to to
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
land at the averages that that we feel
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
are are
 
00:46:47.109 --> 00:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
are appropriate given our research
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
so back to the process the first step is
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
to determine a base
 
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.910 align:start position:0%
to determine a base
award

00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
award
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
the second step is to determine what
 
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
we're calling a frequency multiplier
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
so that that is and i will explain that
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
but the frequency multiplier is intended
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
to account for
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
some claimants will have experienced
 
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
more than one incident of abuse
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
the second step in valuing a claim is to
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
apply any aggravating factors
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
so as we as we know uh based on our
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the allegations
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
and as we know
 
00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:24.559 align:start position:0%
in talking with victim advocates and
 
00:47:24.559 --> 00:47:26.870 align:start position:0%
in talking with victim advocates and
others

00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
not all
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
incidents of sexual or physical abuse
 
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
are created equal
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
there can be aggravating factors that
 
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
that create more trauma for instance was
 
00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
a deadly weapon used was
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
was uh was there more than one person
 
00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:45.670 align:start position:0%
was uh was there more than one person
involved

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
there are other factors like that
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
aggravating factors that
 
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
that really
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
would lead to the conclusion that that a
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
claim should for a particular incident
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
of abuse should be valued higher so
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
applying aggravating factors is the
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
third step
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
and then the fourth step
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
is applying any any mitigating factors
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
which can reduce the amount of the claim
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
so you go through the first three steps
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
to get a number
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
three based on the allegations and then
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
you apply mitigating factors
 
00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:15.910 align:start position:0%
you apply mitigating factors
which

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
which can be um which can reduce the
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
amount of the claim mitigating factors
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
may be problems of proof
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
or or other issues that the
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
administrator feels
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
necessitate reducing the amount of a
 
00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:40.549 align:start position:0%
necessitate reducing the amount of a
claim

00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
so again page 23 were the or sort of the
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
values of the base award
 
00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
the next few pages are just definitions
 
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
of the various categories of abuse so
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to go through those in
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
detail those are
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
in many
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
in many part provided already in the
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
in the statute that was passed
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
there's some additional detail in there
 
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions on those but i'm
 
00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
not going to go through those in detail
 
00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:09.430 align:start position:0%
not going to go through those in detail
here

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
step two applying a frequency multiplier
 
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
as a way of recognizing
 
00:49:32.559 --> 00:49:35.430 align:start position:0%
as a way of recognizing
that

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:38.630 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
someone who experiences abuse can
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
experience different combinations of
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
abuse and it can happen in different
 
00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.750 align:start position:0%
abuse and it can happen in different
ways

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
ways
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
and so that we sort of need to think
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
as a mix between
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
classifying something purely as one type
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
of abuse and also accounting for the
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
fact that other types of abuse are
 
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
the way we do that to the frequency
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
by taking the number
 
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
of times
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
that someone might have experienced
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
the worst category of abuse they
 
00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:23.430 align:start position:0%
the worst category of abuse they
experienced

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
so if that is for instance five if they
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
experienced five incidents of the worst
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
category of abuse that they experienced
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
for the next two categories of abuse
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
that they may have experienced then by
 
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
by severity
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
you take the number of those combined
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
let's just say that's six
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
and you divide that by two
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
you'd end up with five plus three for a
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
frequency multiplier of eight
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
and then you look at the frequency
 
00:50:57.839 --> 00:51:01.190 align:start position:0%
and then you look at the frequency
multiplier

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
which is in table three
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of page 29
 
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
and table four
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
that frequency multiplier
 
00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
is used
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
is applied to
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that's associated
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
with the worst category of abuse that
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
someone suffered
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
so if they suffered the worst category
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
of abuse that's listed here say two
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
and you have a frequency multiplier of
 
00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.470 align:start position:0%
and you have a frequency multiplier of
eight

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about sexual abuse
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
you look at the table
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
and you'll see on the table that for a
 
00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
frequency multiplier between six and
 
00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:40.790 align:start position:0%
frequency multiplier between six and
nine

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
nine
 
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
so that would put you at 1.4 million
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
dollars just kind of giving a
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
so then you have that 1.4 million dollar
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
number and you go to
 
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
for the aggravating factors you
 
00:52:06.069 --> 00:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
basically you would look through this
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
various elements that may
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
cause an abuse to be be more traumatic
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
and i don't need to read through each of
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
them but i think you see the see the
 
00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:22.390 align:start position:0%
them but i think you see the see the
examples

00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
examples
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
any one of these could add an amount to
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
to the base claim that you've gotten
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
through the frequency multiplier
 
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
so you would just go through this
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
exercise and and add the appropriate
 
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
amounts for any
 
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
if you go over 1.5 million dollars
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
per the statute that that number is
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
capped at 1.5 million so so you might go
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
through this exercise and end up at a
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
number that's above 1.5 million but but
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
the last step in the process that's how
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
you sort of
 
00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
go through the process of valuing the
 
00:53:07.349 --> 00:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
the last step in the process which is
 
00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
laid out
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to skip through the pages
 
00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:19.990 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to skip through the pages
here

00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:26.870 align:start position:0%
 
actually

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
is laid out on page 33 it's step four
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
so taking into account any mitigating or
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
exceptional factors
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
so this
 
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
this is where the this is where
 
00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:42.710 align:start position:0%
this is where the this is where
um

00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:45.030 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
the application of any questions of
 
00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:48.549 align:start position:0%
the application of any questions of
proof

00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
proof
 
00:53:48.559 --> 00:53:49.829 align:start position:0%
proof
or

00:53:49.829 --> 00:53:49.839 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
issues of credibility
 
00:53:52.319 --> 00:53:53.190 align:start position:0%
issues of credibility
or

00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
come in
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
so you could have a situation where you
 
00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
have you have a base value let's just
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
say it's 1.4 million but
 
00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of proof lacking there are
 
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
credibility issues maybe inconsistent
 
00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:12.470 align:start position:0%
credibility issues maybe inconsistent
statements

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:13.990 align:start position:0%
 
other

00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
other issues with the claim that might
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
lead the ag designee or the
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
administrator to say
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
okay if we just use the formula to value
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
what's been submitted on the claim form
 
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
your number would be this be 1.4 million
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
but because
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
of these other issues or inability to
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
get records or the fact that the records
 
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
we need to apply mitigating factors and
 
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
so we think the value should be you know
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
what what the payout should be is
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.270 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
that application of mitigating factors
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
is designed to be
 
00:54:58.789 --> 00:54:58.799 align:start position:0%
somewhat discretionary first in the aeg
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
designees review and then for the
 
00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
administrator if it goes to the
 
00:55:02.319 --> 00:55:04.069 align:start position:0%
administrator if it goes to the
administrator

00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
because of a recognition of a
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
recognition that we really need to look
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
at each of these claims on a
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis and for
 
00:55:14.069 --> 00:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
for cases like this and claims like this
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
where we're talking about events that
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
happened a long time ago there could be
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
a wide variation in the records that are
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
now available
 
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
in the witnesses that
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
were present at the time and said
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
something and that are available now
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
in the memories of a victim
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
in what the victim may have said to
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
someone else at the time there's just a
 
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
wide variety in in the facts that could
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
be present so
 
00:55:42.789 --> 00:55:42.799 align:start position:0%
so there's some discretion there in the
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
application of mitigating factors but
 
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
that is really where
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
that's where you consider
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
um the issues of proof and other types
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:56.069 --> 00:55:56.079 align:start position:0%
again i think this
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
we recognize that this that is a
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
difficult exercise you know
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
everything about what we're trying to do
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
here is difficult
 
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
we recognize that there is no um
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
there's no one standard by which to
 
00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.069 align:start position:0%
there's no one standard by which to
measure

00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
measure
 
00:56:14.549 --> 00:56:14.559 align:start position:0%
what a victim should be able to show
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
to substantiate their claims there just
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
isn't so that this is
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
i also think i think
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
this recognizes
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
a key concept which i've talked about
 
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
before but which i think is worth
 
00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:28.829 align:start position:0%
before but which i think is worth
remembering

00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:28.839 align:start position:0%
remembering
 
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
that there is a major difference between
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
a victim who simply
 
00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:36.549 align:start position:0%
a victim who simply
doesn't

00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:56:36.559 --> 00:56:40.069 align:start position:0%
doesn't
remember

00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
with specificity what happened to them
 
00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
but knows for sure that they were harmed
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
20 years later
 
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
30 years later
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
more years later it's difficult to
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
expect any victim to be able to say yes
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
i was
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
i suffered six incidents of this type of
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
abuse two incidents of that type of
 
00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:00.559 align:start position:0%
abuse and three incidents of that type
 
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
of abuse
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
we expect that
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
um we expect that that that most victims
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
are not gonna be able to recall what
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
happened to them with that specificity
 
00:57:10.559 --> 00:57:11.670 align:start position:0%
happened to them with that specificity
but

00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
we have seen through especially our
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
criminal investigation that
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
they will they will have a memory now of
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
a certain number of incidents
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
so what i'm saying is that
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
that just because what a victim is
 
00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
saying now with regard to the number of
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
incidents that happen to them it may it
 
00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
may also ultimately not be accurate as
 
00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
to what really happened 30 or 40 years
 
00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:36.630 align:start position:0%
to what really happened 30 or 40 years
ago

00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
but that is a lot different than than
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
saying a victim is is lying or not
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
telling the truth a victim could be
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
telling us what they absolutely believed
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
happened to them
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
as they sit here today
 
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
and it may actually not be what happened
 
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
i just go through that because that's
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
part of what this process is designed to
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
address when we talk about mitigating
 
00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:00.069 align:start position:0%
address when we talk about mitigating
factors

00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
factors
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's meant to account for the
 
00:58:05.829 --> 00:58:05.839 align:start position:0%
fact that um
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
that a victim may remember things a
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
certain way and believe certain things
 
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
happen to them
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
and that we should we should not
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
we should not question them in such that
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
we would accuse them of lying to us
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
but we have an obligation to
 
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
to look at all the information to
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
determine whether there may be
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
information that would tell us
 
00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.349 align:start position:0%
information that would tell us
that

00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps what they remember
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
is not exactly
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
what happened and that's part of what
 
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
the mitigating factors are meant to get
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
at so
 
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
i may not explain that as clearly as i
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
could but but what i'm just trying to
 
00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
get at is this concept that
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
we may feel a victim is telling us the
 
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
truth and that they were abused
 
00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:50.789 align:start position:0%
truth and that they were abused
but

00:58:50.789 --> 00:58:50.799 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
when when events are decades old there
 
00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
are many many factors that could lead
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
that account to not be
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
not be exact enough to know exactly how
 
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%
many incidents occurred and then things
 
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.470 align:start position:0%
like that
so

00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
that just all sort of speaks to to the
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
difficulty of trying to value claims
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
through a process like this and we have
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
wrestled with that we have we put a lot
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
of hours into that we've had a lot of
 
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
conversations with our victim advocates
 
00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
on that front
 
00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:24.559 align:start position:0%
and we've we've sort of arrived at these
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
valuation guidelines
 
00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:29.829 align:start position:0%
valuation guidelines
um

00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
using a lot of or based on a lot of
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
thought around those concepts
 
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's in addition to what i talked
 
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
about earlier with regard to how we
 
00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
tried to pinpoint the average average
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
claim numbers so a lot has gone into
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
this it is not it is not an exact
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
science by any means and there is no
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
no way to i think to construct a process
 
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
like this and be able to say
 
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
with 100 certainty that
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
that everything about it
 
01:00:06.789 --> 01:00:06.799 align:start position:0%
will get us exactly where we need to be
 
01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
we're trying to balance again the
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
obligation of
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
providing fair compensation and treating
 
01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
people equally and fairly
 
01:00:16.559 --> 01:00:18.230 align:start position:0%
people equally and fairly
while

01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
while
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
also meeting our obligation to
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
to respect
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
the dignity of every victim or claimant
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
that comes to us and listen to their
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
and that's basically how they work
 
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
we'll be happy to answer any more
 
01:00:42.309 --> 01:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
questions about the other detail in
 
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
there but i just tried wanted to try to
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
give an overview
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
overview of how the got the valuation
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
the last piece of this package is the
 
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
longest one but again as i'll explain
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know there
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of detail in here that
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
that a victim may not actually have to
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
interact with
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
so this is the claim packet
 
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
the claim packet begins on page 40 of
 
01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:09.839 align:start position:0%
the packet you have before you so the
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
page number up in the left corner page
 
01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:17.270 align:start position:0%
page number up in the left corner page
40.

01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
the first part of the claim packet is is
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
just the notice
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
we think it's a this this is what a
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
victim again will receive so or a
 
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
claimant will receive so when someone
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
comes to this process
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
they will not be asked to sift through
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
the claims process and the guidelines
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
that we just went through those are
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
governing documents for the
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
administrator and for any council
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
whether it's the ag designee or or
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
claimants council that are involved
 
01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
to review and understand those are the
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
governing documents
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
this claim packet is what a claimant
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
would receive
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
so the first page of a claim packet
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
as you'll see is just a notice and
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
trying to acknowledge that even just
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
going through this packet if you're a
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
victim of abuse can be difficult
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
and to provide
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
to provide right up front resources that
 
01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
someone may want to access if they're
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
even thinking about going through this
 
01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.750 align:start position:0%
even thinking about going through this
process

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
we think that's important because we
 
01:02:15.359 --> 01:02:16.789 align:start position:0%
we think that's important because we
think

01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
there could be claimants or victims who
 
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
come through this process that that have
 
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
not been following everything that's
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
that had something happened to them many
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
and the first time they really see any
 
01:02:31.109 --> 01:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment of it is in in the notice
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
that this process is happening so when
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
they get this claim form
 
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
we think it's important that right up
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
front there be just an acknowledgement
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
that there could be difficulties and
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
that there are resources available if
 
01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
they just want to talk to someone so
 
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
that's what we've tried to do with this
 
01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:46.630 align:start position:0%
that's what we've tried to do with this
notice

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
notice
 
01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
we've listed new hampshire 2-1-1
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
we will list additional resources once
 
01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
we have the opportunity to to
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
have conversations with relevant
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
organizations and get their agreement to
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
be listed here as as just a resource to
 
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
contact if someone even just gets this
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
packet and that causes them to want to
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
have a conversation before they start to
 
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
the second part of the packet
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
this is just meant to
 
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
to give basic instructions on how to
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
fill out the packet and
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
it also provides right up front as
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
you'll see at the bottom of page 41 how
 
01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
to request
 
01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.789 align:start position:0%
to request
assistance

01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
and again this is an important concept
 
01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.710 align:start position:0%
and again this is an important concept
because

01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
you know we we know that we have to
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
recognize that there may be some
 
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
claimants who would come through this
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
process that don't have a lawyer and
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
as much as we want to try to make this
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
process as simple as possible
 
01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:50.630 align:start position:0%
process as simple as possible
and

01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
you know as much as this process will be
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
much simpler than litigating
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
there's really no way to construct a
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
contain some level of detail
 
01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
isn't somewhat complicated and requires
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
some level of work to go through
 
01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.029 align:start position:0%
some level of work to go through
so

01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:11.039 --> 01:04:12.390 align:start position:0%
so
we

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
we want to acknowledge in here that we
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
we need to provide assistance for
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
claimants who may not have an attorney
 
01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
and make clear that that assistance is
 
01:04:19.599 --> 01:04:20.789 align:start position:0%
and make clear that that assistance is
available

01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
that theme runs throughout the packet as
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see at the top of every page
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
we try to just reiterate if you need
 
01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.950 align:start position:0%
we try to just reiterate if you need
assistance

01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
this is who you would contact
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
and obviously we will fill in the
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
content the exact contact information
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
once we
 
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
we know what that is
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
so the next part of the packet is just
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
the instructions
 
01:04:41.839 --> 01:04:43.029 align:start position:0%
the instructions
um

01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
just gives basic instructions on on what
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
to fill out
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
we also
 
01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
um again
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
look to make clear as you'll see
 
01:04:54.069 --> 01:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
in the second piece of the instructions
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
on on page 42 make very clear that
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
we want a claimant to do their best to
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
provide all of the required information
 
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
but that you can submit an incomplete
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
form and it will be accepted and you
 
01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
will be contacted with someone who would
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
assist you on how to get through the
 
01:05:09.599 --> 01:05:10.710 align:start position:0%
assist you on how to get through the
process

01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
so again our goal is to reiterate that
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
at every stage that this is not intended
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
a process in which
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
your claim gets kicked back because you
 
01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
miss one field or many fields
 
01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
this is intended to be a process in
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
which you take your first shot at
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
getting as much information as there as
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
you can and that that will begin the
 
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
process a process in which you'll be
 
01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
contacted with assistance to collect
 
01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
that concept of
 
01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
of not
 
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
not requiring someone to necessarily
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
fill out everything or even most most of
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:54.319 --> 01:05:55.349 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
what we arrived at after a lot of
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
thought and a lot of kind of agonizing
 
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
over the worry that this process is too
 
01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.430 align:start position:0%
over the worry that this process is too
complicated

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
that's the concept that we arrived at as
 
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
the best way to balance the need to
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
collect the information we would need
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
and the administrator would need to
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
evaluate a claim
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
with the need to make this accessible to
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
victims of abuse
 
01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:20.799 align:start position:0%
is that we we have to ask for the
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
information we need to ultimately try to
 
01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
collect it but
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
we don't want to put we don't want to
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
make the victim themselves do all of
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
that work with no help we want to
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
provide sufficient assistance to get any
 
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
unrepresented claim in through the
 
01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:37.829 align:start position:0%
unrepresented claim in through the
process

01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
the only other way to address that would
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
have been to just cut down i think on
 
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
what we're asking for
 
01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:44.390 align:start position:0%
what we're asking for
and

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
while that's an option that would make
 
01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
it more difficult to ensure that we are
 
01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
we're collecting all the information we
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
need and then we're really we're we're
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
treating every victim fairly by trying
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
similar claims
 
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
so the next piece of the
 
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
the claim packet and i'm spending a
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
little more time on this this part just
 
01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
because this is what the this is what a
 
01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
victim or claimant would really interact
 
01:07:12.319 --> 01:07:13.990 align:start position:0%
victim or claimant would really interact
with

01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
the next piece is just the instructions
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
on page 44 for collecting and providing
 
01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
additional documents
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
again we tried to put a lot of thought
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
into what documentation we wanted to ask
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
for from a claimant
 
01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:27.670 align:start position:0%
for from a claimant
and

01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
we're really just asking for
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
for the basics here i think in addition
 
01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
to the form just something that
 
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:37.589 align:start position:0%
to the form just something that
that

01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
you know verifies their identification
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
we do provide here though that if
 
01:07:43.349 --> 01:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
someone doesn't have one of these that
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
they can contact the administrator
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
to try to work to find another another
 
01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:49.510 align:start position:0%
to try to work to find another another
acceptable

01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
form of identification and we're very
 
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
aware that that you know there could be
 
01:07:56.950 --> 01:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
folks who have just don't have forms of
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
identification identification available
 
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
to them
 
01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
i think our attempt with this is to
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
reflect that we want to
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
we would want the administrator to work
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
with those individuals and not just
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
cut someone off because they don't have
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
a driver's license or a passport or a
 
01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:18.149 --> 01:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
the next thing is the sign notice of
 
01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
filing of claim and partial stay
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
that is just what someone would have to
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
file because the the legislation
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
provides that if you enter this process
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
you're not giving up your rights to
 
01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.550 align:start position:0%
you're not giving up your rights to
litigate

01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
litigate
 
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
but you are agreeing to pause your
 
01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
litigation while you go through this
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
process um we think that just makes
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
sense from a logistical standpoint in an
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
administrative standpoint so that we're
 
01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:42.789 align:start position:0%
administrative standpoint so that we're
not

01:08:42.789 --> 01:08:42.799 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
we don't have people coming through this
 
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
at the same time that we're
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
doing motion practice or conducting
 
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
discovery in the litigation process
 
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
those two things aren't necessarily
 
01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:58.309 align:start position:0%
those two things aren't necessarily
consistent

01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
so there are some additional documents
 
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:00.789 align:start position:0%
so there are some additional documents
that

01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
that some claimants may need to submit
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
but there's also a lot of
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of optional documents listed on
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
page 45. so there there are a lot of
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
documents that a claimant may be able to
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
submit that would be very helpful
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
in helping us review their claim but we
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
did not
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
we did not want to require claimants to
 
01:09:20.709 --> 01:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
submit this type of info because many
 
01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
claimants may not have have this type of
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
info so medical records mental health
 
01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.070 align:start position:0%
info so medical records mental health
records

01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
records
 
01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
diaries notebooks photographs
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
those might all be things that a
 
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
claimant has that they want to submit
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
but we also want to recognize that many
 
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
claimants may not have that so
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
our goal is was to make those optional
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
so that we don't make people feel like
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
if they don't have those documents they
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
can't go through this process so they're
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
to successfully make a claim
 
01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.630 align:start position:0%
to successfully make a claim
but

01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
this type of information is always
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
helpful so we did want to list it as
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
something they could provide
 
01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:56.950 align:start position:0%
something they could provide
provide

01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
starting on page 46 we just have the
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
we start in with the basic form
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
of information that a claimant would
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
fill out
 
01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:11.669 align:start position:0%
fill out
um

01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
actually that's starting on page 47
 
01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:15.669 align:start position:0%
actually that's starting on page 47
sorry

01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
again we we spent a lot of time trying
 
01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.229 align:start position:0%
again we we spent a lot of time trying
to

01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh wrestling with how to keep this as
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
simple as possible while collecting the
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
information we thought was basic
 
01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
information that would be needed in a
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
process like this
 
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
so i won't read through every section of
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
the claim form but i
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
i would just note that
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know we we try to keep the language
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
very straightforward as much as we can
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
we try to really structure these
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
questions so that where they can be
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
they're yes or no questions with options
 
01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
to provide additional information
 
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
if if you can but not required to
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
provide a lot of detail if you don't
 
01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
have it
 
01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:00.550 align:start position:0%
have it
again

01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
if some of these or even most of these
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
fields are left empty that's okay
 
01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.030 align:start position:0%
fields are left empty that's okay
because

01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
the form can still be submitted
 
01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
and someone from the administrator's
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
office would would contact a claimant to
 
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
to help them
 
01:11:17.669 --> 01:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
help them provide at least the basic
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
minimum information that would be needed
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
to process a claim
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
again i just think it's important to
 
01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
remember as i've said before that we
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
expect that almost everyone who would
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
come through this process would have an
 
01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.470 align:start position:0%
come through this process would have an
attorney

01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:31.350 align:start position:0%
attorney
so

01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
so i think an attorney would be more
 
01:11:35.669 --> 01:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
than capable of assisting a claimant
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
with filling out
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
you know with that i again i'm not going
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
to go through each question that's asked
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions um
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
on any specific piece of information we
 
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
ask for but
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
on page
 
01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:07.430 align:start position:0%
on page
50

01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
50
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
one of the pieces that will come in this
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
claim packet is a worksheet that i'm
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
sure you've all seen and
 
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
and i will acknowledge right up front
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
that that worksheet could could look
 
01:12:23.189 --> 01:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
very complicated not just to a potential
 
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
claimant but to anyone who looks at it
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
that worksheet is optional it's an
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
optional way for claimant to go through
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
and try to calculate their claim value
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
if they would like
 
01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.149 align:start position:0%
if they would like
but

01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
the basic claim form we tried to limit
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
to just the the basic information that
 
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
someone might be able to tell us about
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
any abuse they suffered
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
so you'll see
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
on page 50 here in the description of
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
we try to limit this to sort of yes or
 
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
no questions and and number in in a and
 
01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
a field where someone can list the
 
01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
number of times they might have been
 
01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.350 align:start position:0%
number of times they might have been
abused

01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
abused
 
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
to try to make it as
 
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
simple as possible for someone to to
 
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
articulate that
 
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
we know in talking to our victim witness
 
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
advocates that that a victim of abuse is
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
not always able to
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
to articulate what happened
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
you don't you don't always get
 
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
what you might expect to get in a
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
situation where you just ask someone
 
01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
what did you do last weekend it could be
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
it could just be a lot of stream of
 
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
consciousness thoughts
 
01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
which is understandable when someone has
 
01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
experienced trauma and especially
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
understandable when someone has
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
experienced trauma that
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
is decades old and they may remember
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
differently now
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
so we've tried to boil this down
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
into very basic information
 
01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
ask for
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
ask a claimant to provide as much
 
01:13:59.910 --> 01:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
information in other fields as they can
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
so we we asked for pages to be attached
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
and we if you go to page 51
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
you know you can see we we we would ask
 
01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:09.830 align:start position:0%
you know you can see we we we would ask
for

01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
just as much information as someone can
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
remember or can articulate about what
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
happened to them but this is not
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
this isn't required it doesn't all have
 
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
to be listed out it's
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
it's optional
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
and it's an attempt to recognize that
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
that every victim will be different
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
in what they're able to articulate about
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
about what happened to them
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
so that theme sort of runs throughout
 
01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
the forums so i'm not again i'm not
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
going to go through a question by
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
question but i did want to note that
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
piece because
 
01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
it's those basic questions and the basic
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
number of times piece that we ask for to
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
be filled out in the claim form
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
and the claims worksheet which we'll
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
talk about is an optional tool we think
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
that's an important tool because it um
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
it helps
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
a victim or their counsel just really go
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
through the calculation to get a sense
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
of what they would get under this
 
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
process but it is not something that a
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
victim has to fill out in order to go
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
something the administrator will
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
certainly use to or the ag designee will
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
use to to arrive at a position or arrive
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
at a value for the claim
 
01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.229 align:start position:0%
at a value for the claim
but

01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's not something a victim has to work
 
01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:24.709 align:start position:0%
it's not something a victim has to work
through

01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
so i think the next important point on
 
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
and this
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
this re-emphasizes what i was just
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
talking about this is where
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
you know after a claimant has gone
 
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
through the form
 
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
they they come up with their amount
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
this is where you can see that you know
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
they have the option of of having gone
 
01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
through the worksheet and and made a
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
calculation based on that
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
or just an option of of making an
 
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.110 align:start position:0%
or just an option of of making an
estimate

01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the day
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
what's most important for for
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
for the process is to collect
 
01:16:11.669 --> 01:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
information about
 
01:16:11.679 --> 01:16:12.550 align:start position:0%
information about
what

01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
a victim may have suffered
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
and it will ultimately be for
 
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
while we want a victim
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
and a claimant to we want them to have
 
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
the ability
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
to go through the calculation themselves
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
in putting the number in their claim
 
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:30.870 align:start position:0%
in putting the number in their claim
um

01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
that's not necessary for the process
 
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
because if the ag designee and the
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
administrator has the information they
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
can go through that calculation and
 
01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:40.709 align:start position:0%
can go through that calculation and
and

01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
essentially tell a victim what their
 
01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:43.590 align:start position:0%
essentially tell a victim what their
claim

01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
claim
 
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
what they could be paid out on their
 
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
claim based on the process so this
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
page reflects that a claimant a victim
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
has the option of going through that
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
calculation or they can just put an
 
01:16:58.870 --> 01:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
estimated amount down at the bottom
 
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
and that amount will be accepted it will
 
01:17:02.630 --> 01:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
be reviewed and reviewed against the
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
calculations but from the claimant and
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
the victim standpoint that's
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's all the minimum or ask them to do
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
is put some amount down and whether they
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
use the
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
whether they go through the worksheet
 
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
and calculate the amount
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
whether they go through the guidelines
 
01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
themselves and try to estimate the
 
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
amount or whether they just estimate the
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
amount based on
 
01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
they know the cap is 1.5 million and
 
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:28.790 align:start position:0%
they know the cap is 1.5 million and
they

01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
they think that that they should
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
should get something they have an idea
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
of what what they should be entitled to
 
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
they can put that amount in there
 
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
because we will have collected necessary
 
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
information or we will have the
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
administrator's staff work with the
 
01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
victim to collect the necessary
 
01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.750 align:start position:0%
victim to collect the necessary
information

01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to work through
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh work through that and get to the
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
right number
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
and it will not all be on the claimant
 
01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
so that that is the the form at a high
 
01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:01.910 align:start position:0%
so that that is the the form at a high
level

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
again starting on and i'm i'm not going
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
to go through this in detail because it
 
01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's pretty detailed but starting on
 
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
page 62
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
you then have just the claim worksheet
 
01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
i think it
 
01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
appears complicated at first blush and
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
it you know it is somewhat complicated
 
01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:20.790 align:start position:0%
it you know it is somewhat complicated
but

01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
after you've read through this and in
 
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
thinking about it i think it actually
 
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
does provide a pretty good tool by which
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
to go through and calculate a claim
 
01:18:28.159 --> 01:18:29.030 align:start position:0%
to go through and calculate a claim
amount

01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
i think that will especially be the case
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
once this is put into uh electronic
 
01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
format in a web-based format
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
so we try to make it
 
01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
you know kind of a
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
simple sort of in the same layout as a
 
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
turbo tax type system right where you're
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
just you're plugging in
 
01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
information and numbers and based on the
 
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
formulas a claim a claim amount is
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
determined but
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
when it's down here on paper
 
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
i know it looks like a lot
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
you'll also notice that there are pages
 
01:18:58.960 --> 01:18:59.910 align:start position:0%
you'll also notice that there are pages
where

01:18:59.910 --> 01:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
you know it will say if you completed
 
01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
the prior page you do not need to
 
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
and that's that's on a lot of pages
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
especially starting at let's say page 65
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
page 68.
 
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
there will be other parts of here where
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
there are their fields you really don't
 
01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
need to complete you can leave blank
 
01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:24.950 align:start position:0%
need to complete you can leave blank
um

01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
again when this is put into uh to an
 
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
electronic format in a website
 
01:19:32.229 --> 01:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
i think it will be even more digestible
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
because you will just be directed past
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
or directed around the fields that you
 
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
don't need to complete you won't be
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
staring at a bunch of empty fields that
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
may not be relevant to you
 
01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:44.390 align:start position:0%
may not be relevant to you
that

01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:45.270 align:start position:0%
that
that

01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
make it seem so complicated that you
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
then just don't even don't even go
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
so that is the worksheet again
 
01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
you know we recognize there there's
 
01:19:58.709 --> 01:19:58.719 align:start position:0%
there's some information there it can
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
look like a lot but we have worked very
 
01:20:01.199 --> 01:20:02.229 align:start position:0%
look like a lot but we have worked very
hard

01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
hard
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
to try to make the language as
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
digestible as possible
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
and to try to make this as
 
01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
straightforward as we think it can be
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
while balancing the need to
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
to collect
 
01:20:18.629 --> 01:20:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
that is um
 
01:20:22.629 --> 01:20:22.639 align:start position:0%
you know that is really this that is the
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
package at a high level i know i spent
 
01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
some time on it and i could have
 
01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
i could probably
 
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
if i went through everything line by
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
line like we sometimes do with with
 
01:20:33.189 --> 01:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation we could spend a
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
lot more time but
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
i thought with that what i would do is
 
01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:38.149 align:start position:0%
i thought with that what i would do is
just

01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:20:38.159 --> 01:20:39.110 align:start position:0%
just
pause

01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
pause
 
01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.550 align:start position:0%
pause
and

01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure
 
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
sure there will be questions but that
 
01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
that is the overview i have for you
 
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
again we've put a lot of time into this
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
but we do understand that
 
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
the committee may have feedback and
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're looking forward to hearing that to
 
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
answering questions
 
01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
and to working to ultimately get this
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
process approved either today or down
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
the line so that we can stand this up
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
for victims and provide this option
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
again i think we've always thought of
 
01:21:08.629 --> 01:21:08.639 align:start position:0%
this as
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
an alternative option to litigation
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
but presenting it as an option
 
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
if if someone
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
does not believe this process is
 
01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:20.390 align:start position:0%
does not believe this process is
sufficient

01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
if a claimant doesn't believe this
 
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
process provides enough compensation
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
they always have the option of
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
continuing to litigate their case in
 
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
court and we will respect that
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
and we will
 
01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
we will
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
conduct ourselves in the litigation
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
process with
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
with respect and dignity with having
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
respect and dignity for the claimant and
 
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
and in a civil manner and
 
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
and we will do that and we we are
 
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
prepared to do that we're prepared to to
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
litigate the cases that we need to
 
01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:49.030 align:start position:0%
litigate the cases that we need to
litigate

01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
litigate
 
01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
so that that is my presentation for you
 
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
i hope that was helpful but we are happy
 
01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
to answer any and all questions you have
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
and of course to stay here as long as we
 
01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
need to stay which is always our
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
obligation in any meeting of of the
 
01:22:04.709 --> 01:22:04.719 align:start position:0%
legislature so thank you thank you very
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
much um
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
that was uh i thought a good
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
presentation excellent presentation to
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
i'd like to
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
kind of go around the room and
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
anybody that has
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
comments questions or whatever
 
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to sort of do it in an
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
orderly fashion if we could
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
so is there someone that would like to
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
senator daniels
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:43.350 --> 01:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
on page four when you state uh who may
 
01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
file a claim
 
01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
it's stated as any living former ydc
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
resident does that mean that a current
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:10.159 --> 01:23:11.830 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
i know so i know that that looks
 
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
somewhat confusing but the way we've
 
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
defined former ydc resident is someone
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
who resided at ydc at any time
 
01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:21.350 align:start position:0%
who resided at ydc at any time
so

01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
if someone is
 
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
residing there now they would still fall
 
01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
under the under the definition but i
 
01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
believe in the definition you used the
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
word resided
 
01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
as past tense
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
not residing yep i would read it as
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
allowing someone to
 
01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
to file a claim even if they're
 
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
currently at ydc we
 
01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
have not
 
01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:46.390 align:start position:0%
have not
um

01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think we are aware of anyone who
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
is alleging current abuse at ydc that
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
would want to come through this process
 
01:23:54.719 --> 01:23:55.590 align:start position:0%
would want to come through this process
uh

01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
that does not mean there aren't some out
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
i mean there could be some allegations
 
01:24:00.629 --> 01:24:00.639 align:start position:0%
of current abuse but that's not
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
at the time we um
 
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
constructed the legislation and at the
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
time we began this process
 
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
we weren't thinking like that was not on
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
our minds but this is intended to cover
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
anyone at ydc so
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
the way i read the the definitions has
 
01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:18.470 align:start position:0%
the way i read the the definitions has
resided

01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
resided
 
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
i mean they res
 
01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
i think they would qualify
 
01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:24.629 align:start position:0%
i think they would qualify
okay

01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:26.639 align:start position:0%
and uh madam chair do you just want me
 
01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
to go through yes just please continue
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
as i look at this
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
by the definition and such there is no
 
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations
 
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
on how far back you can go is that
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct okay and then i
 
01:24:45.669 --> 01:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
guess my final question
 
01:24:45.679 --> 01:24:46.950 align:start position:0%
guess my final question
uh

01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:48.070 align:start position:0%
uh
is

01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
recognition given
 
01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
to the abuse as and as to whether these
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
state was knowledgeable and negligent
 
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
in that or just an individual
 
01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:06.470 align:start position:0%
in that or just an individual
um

01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
case without the state knowledge
 
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
so i think where that recognition would
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
come in is in the mitigating factors and
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
because the mitigating factors deal with
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
what defenses the state might have
 
01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
for a particular
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
claim any legal defenses the state might
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
have so
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
so that that is where that recognition
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
would be given that that you could have
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
a claim that you go through the formula
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
and it's valued at at a certain number
 
01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.270 align:start position:0%
and it's valued at at a certain number
and

01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
the issue is not necessarily that um
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
we don't bel
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
there are issues with proof as to
 
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
whether the events happened
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
but there may be
 
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
particular facts applicable to that
 
01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:51.750 align:start position:0%
particular facts applicable to that
claim

01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
claim
 
01:25:53.669 --> 01:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
that show that the state would have
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
particularly strong legal defenses that
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
could be part of the mitigating factors
 
01:25:59.669 --> 01:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
that cause you to reduce the claim
 
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
amount so i think the answer is yes that
 
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
that could be recognized
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
the important distinction though is that
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
the mitigating factors make clear that
 
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
defenses that just might be generally
 
01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:12.070 align:start position:0%
defenses that just might be generally
applicable

01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
applicable
 
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
to claims that come through this process
 
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
so for instance
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
a statute of limitations defense
 
01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
that just could be generally applicable
 
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
to any claim
 
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
coming through this process that is
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
older than three years ago
 
01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
those types of defenses would not be
 
01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't would not be considered the
 
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
mitigating factors but more fact
 
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
specific defenses which you seem to be
 
01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
describing as to whether
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
whether the state really was negligent
 
01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
or whether really would have known about
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
it those could be applied depending on
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
the case i think in the mitigating
 
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
senator bradley do you want to go next
 
01:26:50.639 --> 01:26:52.550 align:start position:0%
senator bradley do you want to go next
or

01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
okay turn your mic on please
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:57.189 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
um a couple of concerns um
 
01:27:02.950 --> 01:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
i think cueing off of what senator
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
daniels said i think there has to be
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
absolute clarification on current
 
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
residents so if in
 
01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:11.669 align:start position:0%
residents so if in
um

01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
you know the possibility of
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
allegations of current abuse
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
could you move your mic forward
 
01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry yeah that's okay
 
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
um i'll start again i think following up
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
on what
 
01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh senator daniels said i think there
 
01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
has to be clarification on
 
01:27:32.709 --> 01:27:32.719 align:start position:0%
the current resident being able to come
 
01:27:32.719 --> 01:27:33.910 align:start position:0%
the current resident being able to come
forward

01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:35.990 align:start position:0%
forward
um

01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
and just to ensure that there are no
 
01:27:40.629 --> 01:27:40.639 align:start position:0%
allegations of
 
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
current abuse that are not covered i
 
01:27:44.629 --> 01:27:44.639 align:start position:0%
think that's really important
 
01:27:44.639 --> 01:27:47.110 align:start position:0%
think that's really important
um

01:27:47.110 --> 01:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
so this second one is a question i think
 
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
we were looking at page 50
 
01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:55.669 align:start position:0%
we were looking at page 50
and

01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:55.679 --> 01:27:58.709 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
i thought i heard you say that
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
the description of the abuse you
 
01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.070 align:start position:0%
the description of the abuse you
suffered

01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
suffered
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
is optional to fill out the form but it
 
01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
says required
 
01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:09.350 align:start position:0%
says required
what

01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
am i missing or what did i misunderstand
 
01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
so what what i meant by that senator is
 
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:20.950 align:start position:0%
 
again

01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
you know if someone left this blank we
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't reject the claim but we would
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
we would follow up to get this
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
information but i think the basics that
 
01:28:31.350 --> 01:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
are required
 
01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:32.390 align:start position:0%
are required
are

01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
the yes or no questions and what's
 
01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
what's in the table here in the number
 
01:28:40.229 --> 01:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
what's not required i think is
 
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
all of the detail so that that's
 
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
to the extent it wasn't clear i
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
apologize but that's what i was talking
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
about by what's not really required we
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
need we would need kind of some of we
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
would need the yes or no questions
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
answered and the basic information about
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
how many times so i would think that
 
01:28:59.350 --> 01:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
that hopefully would be clarified
 
01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:00.950 align:start position:0%
that hopefully would be clarified
um

01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.510 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
a couple of more things if i might madam
 
01:29:09.430 --> 01:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
chair absolutely just continue until you
 
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
i i really appreciate you know all the
 
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
work that's gone into this i was a
 
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of 1677
 
01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:21.430 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of 1677
with

01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
representative umberger
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:28.470 align:start position:0%
you have
um

01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
really worked hard to try to
 
01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
bring a process forward to resolve some
 
01:29:35.110 --> 01:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
of these claims
 
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
and balance the needs of the state
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
versus the needs of victims i mean that
 
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
that's your job and i you know i commend
 
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
you for it
 
01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.790 align:start position:0%
you for it
um

01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
i appreciate
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
what you said about
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
the fact that you have not had many
 
01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
claimants counsel
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
come and interact with you
 
01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:57.430 align:start position:0%
come and interact with you
um

01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
i think you said they have not engaged
 
01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:01.750 align:start position:0%
i think you said they have not engaged
so

01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:03.030 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
i i would hope that
 
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
if we don't move forward today which i
 
01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
think we should wait
 
01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:12.790 align:start position:0%
think we should wait
and

01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:14.719 align:start position:0%
have all of the concerns outlined and
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
then have you back in and have those
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
concerns addressed i would hope that the
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
claimants councils in fact do engage
 
01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
with you because i think
 
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
if this is going to work
 
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
there needs to be
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
a process that
 
01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
at least some of the claimants councils
 
01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:33.750 align:start position:0%
at least some of the claimants councils
feel

01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
feel
 
01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
is workable
 
01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
and while they may not have engaged with
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
you they have engaged with us
 
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
and so a couple of things that
 
01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:44.790 align:start position:0%
and so a couple of things that
um

01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
i think need some further discussion
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
with clayman's council and
 
01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
you know one of them
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
is the
 
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.510 align:start position:0%
is the
multiplier

01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
multiplier
 
01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:56.709 align:start position:0%
multiplier
that

01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:30:56.719 --> 01:30:57.990 align:start position:0%
that
it

01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:58.870 align:start position:0%
it
is

01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
potentially difficult to get to the
 
01:31:02.709 --> 01:31:02.719 align:start position:0%
maximum amount because of the
 
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
discounting factor
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
um i think that
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
what has been
 
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
said to us is that
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:14.870 align:start position:0%
you know
one

01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:17.189 align:start position:0%
one
um

01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's sexual abuse or physical
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
abuse is devastating but multiple become
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
exponentially more devastating and so
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
that sort of flies in the face of a
 
01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
discounting so i would hope that gets
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
addressed another issue that has been
 
01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:35.430 align:start position:0%
addressed another issue that has been
brought

01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
brought
 
01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:36.310 align:start position:0%
brought
um

01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
to us
 
01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:38.550 align:start position:0%
to us
is

01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
the overall complexity i think you've
 
01:31:42.149 --> 01:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
tried to
 
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
you know outline how something that is
 
01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:46.310 align:start position:0%
you know outline how something that is
complex

01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
complex
 
01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
is made easy and hopefully
 
01:31:51.189 --> 01:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
with more discussions
 
01:31:51.199 --> 01:31:52.229 align:start position:0%
with more discussions
that

01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:52.239 --> 01:31:53.910 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
can to a certain extent be resolved
 
01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:57.669 align:start position:0%
can to a certain extent be resolved
um

01:31:57.669 --> 01:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:59.189 --> 01:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
i hope that there can be more
 
01:31:59.199 --> 01:32:00.950 align:start position:0%
i hope that there can be more
notification

01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
notification
 
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
in places
 
01:32:04.709 --> 01:32:04.719 align:start position:0%
you know like prisons and things like
 
01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%
that so that
 
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
people are advised of their rights if
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
abuse happened so i think that's
 
01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
something that should be taken into
 
01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
account and another concern that has
 
01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
been raised are
 
01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:18.470 align:start position:0%
been raised are
um

01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
well i think
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
the way it was described by changes
 
01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
after the fact of this document
 
01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:26.950 align:start position:0%
after the fact of this document
um

01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
as being very technical in nature and
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
and not substantive in nature
 
01:32:32.639 --> 01:32:33.830 align:start position:0%
and not substantive in nature
um

01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:34.950 align:start position:0%
um
i

01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
i i think that there has been a concern
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
raised that they could become
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
substantive in nature
 
01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:41.750 align:start position:0%
substantive in nature
and

01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:42.950 align:start position:0%
and
that

01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
that is something that
 
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
you know should be resolved so i think
 
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair those are you know some of
 
01:32:50.709 --> 01:32:50.719 align:start position:0%
the issues that people have brought to
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
us or to me at least
 
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
and i think you know if the
 
01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
process allows
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
council for the claimants to come and
 
01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
further discuss this with you i think
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
from the beginning of the process
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
you know you have been open to that
 
01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:11.910 align:start position:0%
you know you have been open to that
um

01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
you know whether it was through the
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
hearing process on 1677
 
01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:16.950 align:start position:0%
hearing process on 1677
or

01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
um again today
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
so hopefully
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
you know those folks that are
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
you know listening to us remotely will
 
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know recognize that you're willing
 
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
to do that i i hope that that happens
 
01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:31.270 align:start position:0%
to do that i i hope that that happens
and

01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
that at least some of the
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
um claimants counsels will find this a
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
workable process so thank you madam
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
chair you're quite welcome
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro uh thank you thank
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
mr attorney general first of all thank
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
you for appearing before us uh
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
i think your articulation was pretty
 
01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:52.310 align:start position:0%
i think your articulation was pretty
complete

01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
complete
 
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
um excuse me i've got two uh real
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
concerns and i think let's follow up
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
with one of the things that senator
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
bradley said the compass of nature of
 
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
this document
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's very very difficult uh
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
to go to go through this and and you
 
01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
went through it with us
 
01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:10.390 align:start position:0%
went through it with us
and

01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
the number of things that are required
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
are not required
 
01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
they're just magnanimous in in my
 
01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:19.910 align:start position:0%
they're just magnanimous in in my
opinion

01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
and no one's ever tried this before is
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
that correct has there ever been
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
a settlement
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
of this nature
 
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
given this kind of of a
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
of a methodology to solve it
 
01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
to our knowledge there's never been a
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
process like this set up through
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
legislation i think there have been
 
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
similar processes processes agreed to in
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
the context of of litigation but not set
 
01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
up through legislation like this
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
it and how many people have identified
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
themselves to this point
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
uh to the best of your knowledge
 
01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
who were abused in some way shape or
 
01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
form at the at the ydc and the other
 
01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:03.270 align:start position:0%
form at the at the ydc and the other
entities

01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:04.310 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's between five and six hundred
 
01:35:09.990 --> 01:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
they're they're i see news reports now
 
01:35:12.629 --> 01:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
of of claimants council saying they have
 
01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
maybe up to 800 clients
 
01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:17.510 align:start position:0%
maybe up to 800 clients
but

01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
there's a fairly significant number of
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
those clients
 
01:35:23.109 --> 01:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
whose claims stem from
 
01:35:24.629 --> 01:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
suffering abuse in the foster care
 
01:35:24.639 --> 01:35:25.590 align:start position:0%
suffering abuse in the foster care
system

01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
what we're directly aware of and i'm
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
kind of i'm estimating here but i think
 
01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
it's between five and six hundred it's
 
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
and then there are additional
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
claimants out there who
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
have been brought into the discussion
 
01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:46.159 align:start position:0%
but really are making claims based on
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
what abuse they may have suffered in the
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
foster care system
 
01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
to get to follow up on what senator
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
bradley said your interaction with the
 
01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh the lawyers that are representing
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
these these clients and i i believe you
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
said during the iteration that almost
 
01:36:04.629 --> 01:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
all of these people have have
 
01:36:04.639 --> 01:36:05.830 align:start position:0%
all of these people have have
secured

01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
secured
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
legal representation now if you if
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
you're ever trying to handle this
 
01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
i just don't think you could do you
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
could do it
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
that's just my my opinion you can't you
 
01:36:22.709 --> 01:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
and there are people who will fall into
 
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
that category because i because i think
 
01:36:26.950 --> 01:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
of the time that has
 
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
that has gone by so uh so i i think the
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
interaction with with the
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
with with their representation is uh
 
01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's of maximum importance uh we
 
01:36:41.189 --> 01:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
want to solve a problem
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
here and we we want to uh
 
01:36:46.870 --> 01:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
we want to give justice you know justice
 
01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:47.669 align:start position:0%
we want to give justice you know justice
uh

01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
justice delayed is is justice denied
 
01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:52.629 align:start position:0%
justice delayed is is justice denied
uh

01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
some of these people have waited a long
 
01:36:56.709 --> 01:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
long period of time
 
01:36:59.430 --> 01:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
so i think those are those are my points
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair and i i think that
 
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
coming back with uh
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
an update is probably the from my
 
01:37:13.109 --> 01:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
standpoint is the way to go thank you
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:18.229 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you general
 
01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
formula for your
 
01:37:27.669 --> 01:37:27.679 align:start position:0%
thorough explanation i do have a few
 
01:37:27.679 --> 01:37:28.950 align:start position:0%
thorough explanation i do have a few
questions

01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:30.149 align:start position:0%
questions
so

01:37:30.149 --> 01:37:30.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
if there are about five or six hundred
 
01:37:32.639 --> 01:37:34.390 align:start position:0%
if there are about five or six hundred
victims

01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
victims
 
01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
and you think the average award might
 
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
be as high as 700 000
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
that would allow us to to
 
01:37:44.239 --> 01:37:45.149 align:start position:0%
that would allow us to to
settle

01:37:45.149 --> 01:37:45.159 align:start position:0%
settle
 
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
142 cases
 
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
does that mean you're expecting to
 
01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:51.109 align:start position:0%
does that mean you're expecting to
litigate

01:37:51.109 --> 01:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
litigate
 
01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
four or
 
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
four hundred or so
 
01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:57.030 align:start position:0%
four hundred or so
cases

01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
out of the department yep thank you for
 
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
the question i so i think the first
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
point on that is that the average
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
the average we're trying to pinpoint
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
kind of the 700 000 that is the average
 
01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
that the formula would
 
01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:14.830 align:start position:0%
that the formula would
would

01:38:14.830 --> 01:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:17.430 --> 01:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
um result in
 
01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
that comes before applying mitigating
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
factors so i mean it could be that the
 
01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
overall average ends up less depending
 
01:38:25.590 --> 01:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
on what we see
 
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
when people start to come through this
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
process as to whether
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
you would apply the mitigating factors
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
in such a way that and that would make
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
that average come down we just don't
 
01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
and that's that's one discussion we had
 
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
as we went through the legislative
 
01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
process you know until we
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
until folks were to start coming through
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
the process we're not
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
we won't know exactly what the average
 
01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
will be so that would be the first point
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
the second point is that
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
i think i would just answer your
 
01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
question are we are we expecting to
 
01:38:55.119 --> 01:38:56.310 align:start position:0%
question are we are we expecting to
litigate

01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
litigate
 
01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:57.270 align:start position:0%
litigate
um

01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:59.669 --> 01:38:59.679 align:start position:0%
400 cases or more we also don't know
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
that we don't we just don't know how
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
many people are going to come through
 
01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
are going to come through the process
 
01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
but i will say we're prepared to
 
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
litigate and defend every case that we
 
01:39:13.109 --> 01:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
need to litigate and defend
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
i've always viewed this process as
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
an alternative option which the state
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
should provide
 
01:39:19.679 --> 01:39:21.030 align:start position:0%
should provide
but

01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:21.830 align:start position:0%
but
not

01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
a process that we're putting forward
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
because we are afraid to litigate and
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
defend these cases if we need to
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
so we're prepared to litigate any cases
 
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
we need to can't wait to see your budget
 
01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:34.470 align:start position:0%
we need to can't wait to see your budget
request

01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
maybe i can um if i can follow oh yes
 
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
please just continue with all of your
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
questions until you're done described
 
01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:42.149 align:start position:0%
questions until you're done described
your

01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
your process to us as you had this
 
01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:47.590 align:start position:0%
your process to us as you had this
appropriate

01:39:47.590 --> 01:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
number in mind of six or seven hundred
 
01:39:50.639 --> 01:39:52.149 align:start position:0%
number in mind of six or seven hundred
thousand

01:39:52.149 --> 01:39:52.159 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
01:39:52.159 --> 01:39:53.189 align:start position:0%
thousand
um

01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
and so as per claimant and so
 
01:39:56.239 --> 01:39:58.310 align:start position:0%
and so as per claimant and so
essentially

01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
you you backed into those
 
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
frequency and multiplier
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh factors
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
to get to that
 
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
average award
 
01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
i i have a concern that that's not
 
01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:14.310 align:start position:0%
i i have a concern that that's not
victim

01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
victim
 
01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:15.430 align:start position:0%
victim
centered

01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
centered
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
but it's really more about
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:40:23.189 --> 01:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
what what the department
 
01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
needed to do
 
01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
to get to that
 
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
number so i hope you'll
 
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:35.109 --> 01:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
how those factors
 
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
are really are they victim-centered
 
01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i would just respond to that by
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
saying that that was one
 
01:40:45.189 --> 01:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
factor we looked at in trying to get to
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
those numbers again it's it was uh
 
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
it's not an exact science
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
so it was we we
 
01:40:55.109 --> 01:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
we used that
 
01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
because we're being guided by the we use
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
the averages because we are trying to be
 
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
guided by those to stay within the
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
numbers set by the legislation but we
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
also tried to think about what what
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
aggravating factors were more serious
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
than others so i wouldn't want to give
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
the impression that the only thing we
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
did was this formulaic
 
01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
calculation it's a rough
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
sort of a
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
we we used some modeling we we tried to
 
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
use be guided by the averages and we
 
01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:25.030 align:start position:0%
use be guided by the averages and we
also

01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
tried to um
 
01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.030 align:start position:0%
tried to um
evaluate

01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
evaluate
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
looking at other cases around the
 
01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
country like what different aggravating
 
01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:33.669 align:start position:0%
country like what different aggravating
factors

01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
factors
 
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
should be valued at so i would just
 
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
i would just note
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
that i understand that um
 
01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
that anytime you use a formula again as
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
i said before it it doesn't feel as
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
victim-centered and trauma-informed as
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
01:41:53.669 --> 01:41:53.679 align:start position:0%
and and that's just because we're again
 
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
we're balancing
 
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
we're balancing the need to make this
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
victim-centered and trauma informed
 
01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
while balancing the need to have
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
to have some type of standard that makes
 
01:42:04.390 --> 01:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
sure we pay the claims
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
pay the claims out fairly and treat
 
01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
everybody fairly and equally that comes
 
01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:09.270 align:start position:0%
everybody fairly and equally that comes
through

01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:42:11.669 --> 01:42:11.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:16.639 align:start position:0%
and in our um sexual assault statute
 
01:42:16.639 --> 01:42:17.510 align:start position:0%
and in our um sexual assault statute
um

01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
sexual assault
 
01:42:19.199 --> 01:42:20.790 align:start position:0%
sexual assault
doesn't

01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
make a distinction between genital or
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
anal rape and oral rape
 
01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:27.109 align:start position:0%
anal rape and oral rape
so

01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering what
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
the justification is for paying
 
01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:34.629 align:start position:0%
the justification is for paying
less

01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
for an oral rape than an anal or genital
 
01:42:38.719 --> 01:42:40.550 align:start position:0%
for an oral rape than an anal or genital
rape

01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
rape
 
01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
that again is based on a couple of
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
different factors one is
 
01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:45.990 align:start position:0%
different factors one is
is

01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
what we've been able to glean from
 
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
from what settlement payments or what
 
01:42:52.149 --> 01:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
settlement numbers have been around the
 
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
country for various types of abuse
 
01:42:57.750 --> 01:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
also based on again some of the
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
discussions we had with clayman's
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
council prior to the legislative process
 
01:43:04.149 --> 01:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
and what numbers we were talking about
 
01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
for for different categories of abuse
 
01:43:08.229 --> 01:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
but but yes i do recognize that you
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
don't see that same distinction
 
01:43:12.629 --> 01:43:12.639 align:start position:0%
in the criminal code
 
01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:43:14.950 --> 01:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
i think the best answer i can give to
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
that senator is again it
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
we use a number of factors to try to
 
01:43:23.590 --> 01:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
or to try to place values on different
 
01:43:27.669 --> 01:43:27.679 align:start position:0%
types of abuse that account for the
 
01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
different levels of trauma and it's not
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
there is no exact science to it and
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
and there's no um
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
i think there's no way to do that
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
perfectly and again there's no amount of
 
01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:40.709 align:start position:0%
perfectly and again there's no amount of
money

01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
that really adequately compensates
 
01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
someone for that type of abuse
 
01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
that type of abuse that they might have
 
01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
suffered and that any everyone is
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
impacted differently
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
too so i i certainly hear
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
i hear your concern but that's that's
 
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
how we did it
 
01:43:58.229 --> 01:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
is to look at other cases around the
 
01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
country um
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
was based on some of the discussions we
 
01:44:05.669 --> 01:44:05.679 align:start position:0%
had had and that were frankly had even
 
01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
before i arrived at the department of
 
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
justice with claimants counsel before
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
the legislative process because it's all
 
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
rape right and it's rape of children
 
01:44:18.149 --> 01:44:18.159 align:start position:0%
um i have two more specific questions
 
01:44:19.590 --> 01:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
one is
 
01:44:22.629 --> 01:44:22.639 align:start position:0%
that claimant can provide that can
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
has the option to provide medical and
 
01:44:25.199 --> 01:44:26.470 align:start position:0%
has the option to provide medical and
behavioral

01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
behavioral
 
01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
health records
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
01:44:33.030 --> 01:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
process going to be for how long
 
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
somebody maintains those records and
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
what is going to be the process for
 
01:44:43.030 --> 01:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
confirming that they've been destroyed
 
01:44:45.910 --> 01:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
at some point and i'm especially
 
01:44:48.149 --> 01:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
concerned about that since there's going
 
01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
to be a website
 
01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:51.430 align:start position:0%
to be a website
access

01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:44:54.790 --> 01:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
for this information as well what is the
 
01:45:00.629 --> 01:45:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:03.750 --> 01:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
so i i can't speak to from a technical
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
standpoint like the data security and
 
01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
privacy what i can tell you is that
 
01:45:11.590 --> 01:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
you know the administrator is housed
 
01:45:14.229 --> 01:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
within the court system and
 
01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
and the court system will be working
 
01:45:19.109 --> 01:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
with the department of justice
 
01:45:22.629 --> 01:45:22.639 align:start position:0%
the state deals with a lot of sensitive
 
01:45:25.109 --> 01:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
um private information
 
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
and i would anticipate that we would we
 
01:45:29.669 --> 01:45:29.679 align:start position:0%
would utilize all the same protections
 
01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
we utilize
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
for the other sensitive and private
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
records and information that we that we
 
01:45:37.590 --> 01:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
keep we would utilize all those
 
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
protections for these records
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
as to a retention period i'm forgetting
 
01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
i i don't think there was a retention
 
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
period in this statute right no so that
 
01:45:52.870 --> 01:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
we're not covered by hipaa
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
well but we're i think we're covered by
 
01:45:58.080 --> 01:45:59.189 align:start position:0%
well but we're i think we're covered by
a

01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
i'll just say this i think the
 
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
department of justice knows how to keep
 
01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
documents confidential and protect them
 
01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm confident that we will do that
 
01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
i'd love to know more my last question
 
01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
if i could
 
01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
um i see that the claimant has to have
 
01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:14.310 align:start position:0%
um i see that the claimant has to have
their

01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
application notarized
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
would it within the
 
01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
prison the state prisons and the county
 
01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:22.950 align:start position:0%
prison the state prisons and the county
jails

01:46:22.950 --> 01:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
jails
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
do do they all have notaries on staff
 
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
and what is the access like for inmates
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
including those who are on the units
 
01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
you know special units for
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
bad behavior how how quickly
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
can an inmate realistically
 
01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:44.790 align:start position:0%
can an inmate realistically
get

01:46:44.790 --> 01:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:46:47.189 --> 01:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
to a notary
 
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
i i don't have an answer for you on that
 
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head i i think they
 
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
have access because i mean in inmates
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
are entitled to file claims and file
 
01:46:59.590 --> 01:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and but i i don't know the
 
01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:01.510 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and but i i don't know the
exact

01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
exact
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
process by which they access notaries
 
01:47:06.550 --> 01:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
and how quickly it can happen but i do
 
01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
know that residents in our
 
01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:09.830 align:start position:0%
know that residents in our
um

01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
in our prisons and in our county jails
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
they do have
 
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
they do have access to those types of
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
resources because they
 
01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
they file lawsuits they file claims in
 
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
various processes and so i i'm confident
 
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
we could work to make sure that access
 
01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
is provided
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair
 
01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh senator gray uh thank you
 
01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:32.390 align:start position:0%
thank you uh senator gray uh thank you
um

01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
page nine
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
uh section four
 
01:47:41.590 --> 01:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh 14 where you give the three options
 
01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh when i first read this
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
two days ago
 
01:47:47.189 --> 01:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
you know the third option says to
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
withdraw the claim from further
 
01:47:48.719 --> 01:47:50.550 align:start position:0%
withdraw the claim from further
processing

01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
processing
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't go on to say and continue
 
01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:55.109 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't go on to say and continue
litigation

01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
nor does the
 
01:47:57.119 --> 01:47:59.430 align:start position:0%
nor does the
um

01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:03.590 --> 01:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
b c d or e talk about that
 
01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
i understand that probably an attorney
 
01:48:08.229 --> 01:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any problem with that but
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
someone who isn't an attorney says okay
 
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
i'm withdrawing
 
01:48:16.229 --> 01:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh you know having something in there
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
that says then continue litigation or
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
follow the format that you had in b and
 
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
c where you talk about selection option
 
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
one and option two
 
01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
you know option three
 
01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
you know what is your rights at that
 
01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:30.870 align:start position:0%
you know what is your rights at that
point

01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
seems to me that it would be clarifying
 
01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:35.350 align:start position:0%
seems to me that it would be clarifying
uh

01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:37.270 --> 01:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
in that section
 
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
and i've got one more and if you have a
 
01:48:41.350 --> 01:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
comment on that i'll wait
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:47.590 --> 01:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
i think that that's provided in
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
in c in 14c where it talks about the
 
01:48:50.719 --> 01:48:56.229 align:start position:0%
in c in 14c where it talks about the
notice

01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
oh so i see your point
 
01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
well in 14 c you talk about the second
 
01:49:01.119 --> 01:49:02.229 align:start position:0%
well in 14 c you talk about the second
option

01:49:02.229 --> 01:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
option
 
01:49:05.430 --> 01:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
you go second option okay yep so
 
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
either add third option in there
 
01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:09.510 align:start position:0%
either add third option in there
somewhere

01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know again
 
01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
i'm not worried about the attorneys that
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
are reading this
 
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
and even though
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
the good senator who's taking leave of
 
01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
this right now
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
says you know be fooled to do this per
 
01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:24.390 align:start position:0%
says you know be fooled to do this per
se

01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
se
 
01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to try it
 
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
and the more we can help them out the
 
01:49:30.870 --> 01:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
better off i think we are yep yeah i
 
01:49:32.470 --> 01:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
understand that point center yeah it is
 
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
provided for in the statute but i
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
yeah we could work to make it clearer in
 
01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
this document
 
01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
the other question i had was page 31
 
01:49:44.229 --> 01:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
where you go into
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
the aggregate
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
aggravating factors
 
01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
whether or not those are you pick the
 
01:49:52.149 --> 01:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
highest one or
 
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
they're cumulative or whatever and
 
01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
i know that the multipliers was to pick
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
the highest one
 
01:50:01.589 --> 01:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
but the aggregating factors i don't
 
01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:03.679 align:start position:0%
think in your your talk you told me
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
whether that is cumulative or pick the
 
01:50:09.189 --> 01:50:09.199 align:start position:0%
highest these are cumulative so you
 
01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
would for
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
for each aggravating factor you just add
 
01:50:13.199 --> 01:50:14.070 align:start position:0%
for each aggravating factor you just add
up

01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
the the value that would be associated
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
with each one and then it's a total
 
01:50:20.070 --> 01:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
amount added for aggravated aggravating
 
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
factors so they're cumulative thank you
 
01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:38.950 align:start position:0%
factors so they're cumulative thank you
yep

01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:41.750 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
i too got involved in in the
 
01:50:47.589 --> 01:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
forest of trees uh trying to calculate
 
01:50:48.870 --> 01:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
some of this stuff
 
01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
and that's why i asked the question
 
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
what's the low and the high and your
 
01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
response is right on you're in the
 
01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:55.350 align:start position:0%
response is right on you're in the
forest

01:50:55.350 --> 01:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
forest
 
01:50:57.589 --> 01:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
don't look at the trees so
 
01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
i was looking at the trees much like has
 
01:51:02.950 --> 01:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
been mentioned this is so complicated
 
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh that i got lost in the formulas so my
 
01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
suggestion to that end
 
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
is to divide this document which i
 
01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
assume you might going to be doing at
 
01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
some point into different sections
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
separate documents one document is the
 
01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:22.719 align:start position:0%
process one document is the required
 
01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
one document is optional worksheets
 
01:51:27.510 --> 01:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't look like you have to do
 
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
the whole darn thing because right now
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
you're eating an elephant
 
01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
so my suggestion is to for simple people
 
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
like me
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
is take the worksheets that they could
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
do and make them a separate document
 
01:51:42.629 --> 01:51:42.639 align:start position:0%
it's also you're going to have a hell of
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
a time if you keep it one big document
 
01:51:46.629 --> 01:51:46.639 align:start position:0%
with revision management
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to have uh version
 
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
management's going to be a nightmare so
 
01:51:51.189 --> 01:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
if you have three different documents
 
01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
you got a little better chance of
 
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
keeping track of it
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
i did have a process question a
 
01:51:58.229 --> 01:51:58.239 align:start position:0%
procedure question you mentioned the
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
administrative hearing
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
can can a claimant
 
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
go through the administrative hearing
 
01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
and still go to court or once they get
 
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
to the administrative hearing that's it
 
01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
yeah if if a claimant elects to go to
 
01:52:12.149 --> 01:52:12.159 align:start position:0%
the administrative
 
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
the proceeding before the administrator
 
01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
then they would be waiving their rights
 
01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
to go to court at that point good thank
 
01:52:17.119 --> 01:52:17.910 align:start position:0%
to go to court at that point good thank
you

01:52:17.910 --> 01:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:19.910 align:start position:0%
you
um

01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
i spent 25 years in direct mail direct
 
01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
mail business and one of the things we
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
had always was how
 
01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:28.639 align:start position:0%
how little can people write
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
if you look on i'm just i just took page
 
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
55 i wrote it down as an example
 
01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:33.750 align:start position:0%
55 i wrote it down as an example
uh

01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
those lines that are on page 55
 
01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
humans can't write in those lines
 
01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
they're too close together so if you
 
01:52:42.629 --> 01:52:42.639 align:start position:0%
want if you have fewer lines but bigger
 
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
spacing because they're never going to
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
be able to make those lines
 
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
line spacing the other thing is
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
a few years ago i went to the department
 
01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
of justice and had a we had a
 
01:52:59.589 --> 01:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
presentation of online
 
01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh filings and i don't remember what it
 
01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:02.639 align:start position:0%
was for
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh but the biggest problem that they had
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
was with attorneys
 
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
using the online system
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm just throwing that out there if
 
01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719 align:start position:0%
you might we might want to talk to
 
01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
somebody from justice about you know
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
what happened back in the days when we
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
started going online because they had
 
01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
more problems with attorneys using the
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
online system than than citizens so i'm
 
01:53:24.790 --> 01:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying that
 
01:53:26.790 --> 01:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
if history repeats itself you're going
 
01:53:28.629 --> 01:53:28.639 align:start position:0%
to have more attorney problems than
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:33.589 --> 01:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
madam chair i think that concludes my
 
01:53:36.070 --> 01:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
comments thank you
 
01:53:38.229 --> 01:53:38.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative emmerich i am
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative lynn
 
01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam sure
 
01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
i have a number of questions may i just
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
yeah just just continue until you're
 
01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:54.470 align:start position:0%
yeah just just continue until you're
done

01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:53:57.189 --> 01:53:57.199 align:start position:0%
thank you uh first i want to say i i
 
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
really commend both of you i mean i
 
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
think i really think that this i agree
 
01:54:02.550 --> 01:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
with with the comments that have been
 
01:54:05.189 --> 01:54:05.199 align:start position:0%
made by by many of my colleagues that
 
01:54:07.669 --> 01:54:07.679 align:start position:0%
this is complicated but i think as you
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
point out this is really
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a complicated thing and
 
01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that you could
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
i i think some of the suggestions are uh
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
are really good ones and i hope you'll
 
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
take those into account but i'm not sure
 
01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:21.669 align:start position:0%
take those into account but i'm not sure
that

01:54:21.669 --> 01:54:21.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
in the end you're going to be able to
 
01:54:24.229 --> 01:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
make this
 
01:54:27.109 --> 01:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
considerably less complicated than it is
 
01:54:29.109 --> 01:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
because that's just sort of the nature
 
01:54:31.109 --> 01:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
of it so but i do i commend both of you
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
for your work on this it's uh
 
01:54:35.589 --> 01:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
i think it's i think it's a fine job
 
01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
um i have a couple of questions the
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
first question is you mentioned
 
01:54:42.629 --> 01:54:42.639 align:start position:0%
very early in your remarks that um you
 
01:54:44.790 --> 01:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
anticipated that some of the criminal
 
01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
trials may be beginning in early
 
01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:49.430 align:start position:0%
trials may be beginning in early
2023

01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
2023
 
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
and so i i guess my my question is just
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
01:54:57.030 --> 01:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
danger that
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
um in connection with those criminal
 
01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:01.109 align:start position:0%
um in connection with those criminal
trials

01:55:01.109 --> 01:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
trials
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
if there are claimants
 
01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
who are also
 
01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know the subject of
 
01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
of the criminal of of the uh allegations
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
abuse of abuse against them are the
 
01:55:15.189 --> 01:55:15.199 align:start position:0%
basis for the criminal charges that
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
there would be
 
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
that someone in the criminal division of
 
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
your office is going to be moving to
 
01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:20.629 align:start position:0%
your office is going to be moving to
stay

01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
stay
 
01:55:22.950 --> 01:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
some proceedings like this
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
until after those criminal cases are
 
01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:28.229 align:start position:0%
until after those criminal cases are
over

01:55:28.229 --> 01:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:31.109 --> 01:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
i don't well so i'll start by by saying
 
01:55:34.149 --> 01:55:34.159 align:start position:0%
that you know throughout this entire
 
01:55:34.159 --> 01:55:35.030 align:start position:0%
that you know throughout this entire
uh

01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
process and by process i don't just mean
 
01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
this claims process i mean the criminal
 
01:55:41.350 --> 01:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
investigation of the allegations at ydc
 
01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:42.470 align:start position:0%
investigation of the allegations at ydc
and

01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:43.669 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:45.669 --> 01:55:45.679 align:start position:0%
dealing with the
 
01:55:47.669 --> 01:55:47.679 align:start position:0%
the the civil litigation that's arisen
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
out of those allegations
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
there's always been a tension there or
 
01:55:54.149 --> 01:55:54.159 align:start position:0%
or a potential that
 
01:55:56.229 --> 01:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
the civil what's happening on the civil
 
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
side could impact the criminal side or
 
01:56:00.149 --> 01:56:00.159 align:start position:0%
vice versa so we've we've always been
 
01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with that tension
 
01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
i don't have a concern that
 
01:56:06.310 --> 01:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice bureau will move to
 
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
stay this proceeding
 
01:56:10.390 --> 01:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
because we've we've talked about that
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
internally as to whether we were
 
01:56:13.990 --> 01:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
generally going to do that in the civil
 
01:56:15.910 --> 01:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
proceedings and the decision up to this
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
point has been made not to do that
 
01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%
and that decision would ultimately rest
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
with me so if that does happen you know
 
01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
we'll we can anticipate it and deal with
 
01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:25.270 align:start position:0%
we'll we can anticipate it and deal with
it

01:56:25.270 --> 01:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:56:27.510 --> 01:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
but at this point i don't have a concern
 
01:56:29.669 --> 01:56:29.679 align:start position:0%
that that's going to happen okay
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
the next thing i want to ask you about
 
01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
is i and i know
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
you and i talked a little bit about this
 
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday but um
 
01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
the uh you had suggested that there
 
01:56:41.669 --> 01:56:41.679 align:start position:0%
might be a possibility that the
 
01:56:41.679 --> 01:56:43.430 align:start position:0%
might be a possibility that the
administrator

01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:44.950 align:start position:0%
administrator
would

01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh contract
 
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
with with someone to
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
be sort of an advocate or an assistant
 
01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
for people who are are filing claims and
 
01:56:58.390 --> 01:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
and i guess my only
 
01:57:00.550 --> 01:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
question there is
 
01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:02.790 align:start position:0%
question there is
if

01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
i think from what you said if if that
 
01:57:06.629 --> 01:57:06.639 align:start position:0%
were to be done
 
01:57:09.030 --> 01:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
the cost of doing that
 
01:57:11.109 --> 01:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
would be born
 
01:57:12.870 --> 01:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
01:57:14.709 --> 01:57:14.719 align:start position:0%
um and i i guess what i'm really
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
wondering is is there
 
01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
is there the potential for some conflict
 
01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:19.750 align:start position:0%
is there the potential for some conflict
uh

01:57:19.750 --> 01:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
between that
 
01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:23.030 align:start position:0%
between that
and

01:57:23.030 --> 01:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:25.109 --> 01:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
it simply and you know instead of
 
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
instead of instead of having using that
 
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
process just saying to people who seem
 
01:57:31.750 --> 01:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
to be having trouble well
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
you know here are here are attorneys
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
you're a group of attorneys that are
 
01:57:37.589 --> 01:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
willing to do this or are available to
 
01:57:39.350 --> 01:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh to assist you
 
01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:40.709 align:start position:0%
uh to assist you
um

01:57:40.709 --> 01:57:40.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:41.830 --> 01:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
you know why don't you go get an
 
01:57:43.270 --> 01:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
attorney and i guess what i'm thinking
 
01:57:44.950 --> 01:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
there is if they do that then the cost
 
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
of that attorney would be on would be on
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
their shoulders and so
 
01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:50.470 align:start position:0%
their shoulders and so
um

01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:51.910 --> 01:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
you know is there some unfairness
 
01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
between those two
 
01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:55.350 align:start position:0%
between those two
processes

01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
processes
 
01:57:56.709 --> 01:57:56.719 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the questions i
 
01:58:00.629 --> 01:58:00.639 align:start position:0%
understand that concern um i
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
i i don't
 
01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's a big concern
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
there and and this is why
 
01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
when when we're thinking about
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
an advocate that might assist a claimant
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
what we mean by that is is someone who
 
01:58:18.149 --> 01:58:18.159 align:start position:0%
works for the administrator who or who
 
01:58:20.070 --> 01:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
the administrator contracts with that
 
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
could provide basic assistance in the
 
01:58:24.790 --> 01:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
process that has
 
01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
advocate training so that they know how
 
01:58:27.119 --> 01:58:28.070 align:start position:0%
advocate training so that they know how
to

01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719 align:start position:0%
to interact with and assist victims of
 
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
crime but particularly victims of sexual
 
01:58:35.589 --> 01:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
or physical abuse
 
01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
the reason we think we'd want the
 
01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
administrator to have that resource at
 
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
least at hand if necessary is that while
 
01:58:43.189 --> 01:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
we anticipate the administrator will
 
01:58:43.199 --> 01:58:44.950 align:start position:0%
we anticipate the administrator will
have

01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:58:47.830 --> 01:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
administrative resources to assist with
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
the completion of applications
 
01:58:53.589 --> 01:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
victims of crime typically may that or
 
01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
someone with that type of training just
 
01:58:57.270 --> 01:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
kind of more administrative training may
 
01:58:59.350 --> 01:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
not have the training that an advocate
 
01:59:00.870 --> 01:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
would have in the criminal justice
 
01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:02.470 align:start position:0%
would have in the criminal justice
context

01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
context
 
01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
an advocate who knows how to interact
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
with and assist victims of crime and
 
01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's we don't anticipate that that
 
01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
advocate would sort of be advocating for
 
01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:12.950 align:start position:0%
advocate would sort of be advocating for
the

01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:59:14.229 --> 01:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:59:15.990 --> 01:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
the claimant through the process but
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
just helping talk with the claimant
 
01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
maybe helping talk with the claimant
 
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
about whether they would like to
 
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
retain a lawyer claim it may come to
 
01:59:25.830 --> 01:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
this process not wanting to retain an
 
01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:26.870 align:start position:0%
this process not wanting to retain an
attorney

01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:27.750 align:start position:0%
attorney
but

01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:59:30.870 --> 01:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
part of what a victim advocate does in
 
01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
in general for a victim of crime
 
01:59:34.470 --> 01:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
would be to help them think about
 
01:59:36.550 --> 01:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
anything they're doing related to what
 
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
happened to them including bringing a
 
01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
civil case and an advocate might help
 
01:59:41.189 --> 01:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
talk them through whether they want to
 
01:59:42.390 --> 01:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
hire attorney to bring them through the
 
01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:43.990 align:start position:0%
hire attorney to bring them through the
process

01:59:43.990 --> 01:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:59:45.669 --> 01:59:45.679 align:start position:0%
but that advocate could also just help
 
01:59:45.679 --> 01:59:47.910 align:start position:0%
but that advocate could also just help
them

01:59:47.910 --> 01:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
help them navigate the forms themselves
 
01:59:52.629 --> 01:59:52.639 align:start position:0%
but then once the claim is submitted
 
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's not that the advocate is
 
01:59:57.270 --> 01:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
is going through the process with them
 
01:59:59.830 --> 01:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
and and advocating for them
 
02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
in the process so
 
02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:03.109 align:start position:0%
in the process so
i

02:00:03.109 --> 02:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:00:04.870 --> 02:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
i see the concern that the the state
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
would be paying for that but i think our
 
02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
thought is that this
 
02:00:10.229 --> 02:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
we think it's the right thing for the
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
state to be providing just the basic
 
02:00:14.629 --> 02:00:14.639 align:start position:0%
resources to make this process accept
 
02:00:14.639 --> 02:00:15.910 align:start position:0%
resources to make this process accept
accessible

02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
accessible
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
and for some claimants who aren't
 
02:00:20.229 --> 02:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
represented and who have not been able
 
02:00:23.350 --> 02:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
to access the help of an advocate
 
02:00:25.109 --> 02:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
we think that we should have someone
 
02:00:27.109 --> 02:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
with advocate training
 
02:00:28.629 --> 02:00:28.639 align:start position:0%
you know on on standby that the
 
02:00:30.550 --> 02:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
administrator could contract with
 
02:00:32.070 --> 02:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
so but i don't i don't think there'd be
 
02:00:33.669 --> 02:00:33.679 align:start position:0%
a conflict there because that would be
 
02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
to help them get the forms filled out
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
and get started in the process it's not
 
02:00:40.229 --> 02:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
the state isn't paying for someone who
 
02:00:40.239 --> 02:00:41.030 align:start position:0%
the state isn't paying for someone who
is

02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:00:42.709 --> 02:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
who is uh
 
02:00:44.709 --> 02:00:44.719 align:start position:0%
promoting the claimant's position or
 
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
trying to promo or arguing to the
 
02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
administrator in any way that the
 
02:00:50.310 --> 02:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
claimant should be paid they're just
 
02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
helping the claim and fill out the forms
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
okay no thank you i appreciate that uh
 
02:00:57.030 --> 02:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
the next question i have is on page uh
 
02:00:57.040 --> 02:00:58.950 align:start position:0%
the next question i have is on page uh
23

02:00:58.950 --> 02:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
23
 
02:01:02.229 --> 02:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
of in the categories of base awards for
 
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
sexual uh sexual uh for claims of sexual
 
02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:05.990 align:start position:0%
sexual uh sexual uh for claims of sexual
abuse

02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:07.030 align:start position:0%
abuse
um

02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
the though
 
02:01:10.950 --> 02:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
am i correct in understanding
 
02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
that under
 
02:01:16.149 --> 02:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
sub uh subletter e
 
02:01:18.470 --> 02:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
um that
 
02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:21.669 align:start position:0%
um that
the

02:01:21.669 --> 02:01:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
violations of privacy
 
02:01:29.669 --> 02:01:29.679 align:start position:0%
are would not would only be a basis
 
02:01:29.679 --> 02:01:33.030 align:start position:0%
are would not would only be a basis
for

02:01:33.030 --> 02:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:34.709 --> 02:01:34.719 align:start position:0%
for bringing
 
02:01:38.629 --> 02:01:38.639 align:start position:0%
subdivision e into play if
 
02:01:41.830 --> 02:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
it was the violation of privacy
 
02:01:44.310 --> 02:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
created a reasonable apprehension of
 
02:01:45.910 --> 02:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
imminent sexual
 
02:01:48.149 --> 02:01:48.159 align:start position:0%
assault is that correct yes so in other
 
02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:49.679 align:start position:0%
words if somebody
 
02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
if somebody
 
02:01:52.149 --> 02:01:52.159 align:start position:0%
let me
 
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
try to give an example if some if if
 
02:01:56.070 --> 02:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
let's say a guard
 
02:01:59.910 --> 02:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
somehow put an unauthorized camera
 
02:02:03.669 --> 02:02:03.679 align:start position:0%
um in you know in a in the room of an
 
02:02:03.679 --> 02:02:04.550 align:start position:0%
um in you know in a in the room of an
inmate

02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
inmate
 
02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
and was watching
 
02:02:08.709 --> 02:02:08.719 align:start position:0%
the inmate you know
 
02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
all the time including presumably some
 
02:02:12.229 --> 02:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
intimate things that the inmate might be
 
02:02:12.239 --> 02:02:13.109 align:start position:0%
intimate things that the inmate might be
doing

02:02:13.109 --> 02:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:02:13.119 --> 02:02:14.390 align:start position:0%
doing
um

02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
that would not in itself be a base that
 
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
might be a violation of privacy it might
 
02:02:21.270 --> 02:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
be a basis for criminal or some other
 
02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:22.390 align:start position:0%
be a basis for criminal or some other
civil

02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
civil
 
02:02:23.589 --> 02:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
action but
 
02:02:25.830 --> 02:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
without more to suggest that that was
 
02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:26.709 align:start position:0%
without more to suggest that that was
being

02:02:26.709 --> 02:02:26.719 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
that that that gave the person the basis
 
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
to believe that they were i mean
 
02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
for example if the person never knew
 
02:02:35.830 --> 02:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
about that while it was going on then
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
presumably that could not have
 
02:02:40.229 --> 02:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
been the base you know been a basis for
 
02:02:41.990 --> 02:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
the person to reasonably believe that
 
02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
they were about to be sexually assaulted
 
02:02:46.149 --> 02:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
so that even though it might be a
 
02:02:48.390 --> 02:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
violation of privacy would not be a
 
02:02:49.830 --> 02:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
would not be something subject to
 
02:02:54.390 --> 02:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:06.149 --> 02:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i i
 
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
i was gonna say i i think that's correct
 
02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
i always just um
 
02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
reserve based on the fact that there
 
02:03:14.709 --> 02:03:14.719 align:start position:0%
could be a set of facts right where
 
02:03:16.790 --> 02:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
there's a gray area there like a weather
 
02:03:19.109 --> 02:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
person reasonable whether they ever knew
 
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
and when they found out and all that but
 
02:03:23.990 --> 02:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
but yes as a basic matter that that's
 
02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.189 align:start position:0%
but yes as a basic matter that that's
correct

02:03:25.189 --> 02:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:03:26.950 --> 02:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
okay because i know i just want to be
 
02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:32.310 --> 02:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
by the inclusion of violations of
 
02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
privacy we are not sort of
 
02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
through this process is not expanding
 
02:03:39.189 --> 02:03:39.199 align:start position:0%
the reach of the statute to cover right
 
02:03:41.669 --> 02:03:41.679 align:start position:0%
violations of privacy yes yeah and we we
 
02:03:43.589 --> 02:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
thought long and hard about that and
 
02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
before we put that in okay all right
 
02:03:49.189 --> 02:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
next question is on page the same page
 
02:03:49.199 --> 02:03:50.709 align:start position:0%
next question is on page the same page
23

02:03:50.709 --> 02:03:50.719 align:start position:0%
23
 
02:03:53.830 --> 02:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not when i when i see the
 
02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:54.790 align:start position:0%
i'm not when i when i see the
i've

02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
i've
 
02:03:59.189 --> 02:03:59.199 align:start position:0%
the the category c and category d
 
02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
um if you go if you look
 
02:04:06.790 --> 02:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
about in the uh on the subsequent pages
 
02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:04:11.109 --> 02:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
intimate sexual touching and
 
02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh other touching it it sort of seems
 
02:04:15.669 --> 02:04:15.679 align:start position:0%
like they're the same the definitions
 
02:04:18.149 --> 02:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
are kind of the same it still goes back
 
02:04:18.159 --> 02:04:19.430 align:start position:0%
are kind of the same it still goes back
to

02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:20.390 align:start position:0%
to
um

02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
touching for the touching of certain you
 
02:04:24.629 --> 02:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
know intimate areas for the purpose of
 
02:04:27.510 --> 02:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
sexual gratification so i'm not i'm not
 
02:04:29.189 --> 02:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
quite clear if there's
 
02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
what is the distinction between
 
02:05:10.709 --> 02:05:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
in other words maybe you know if this if
 
02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
this helps a little bit i know that in c
 
02:05:16.069 --> 02:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
you give the example of masturbation you
 
02:05:18.629 --> 02:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
put in parenthesis as an example of what
 
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
would would violate c
 
02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:22.470 align:start position:0%
would would violate c
masturbation

02:05:22.470 --> 02:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
masturbation
 
02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:27.910 --> 02:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
but that would i mean i think that would
 
02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:30.069 align:start position:0%
but that would i mean i think that would
be

02:05:30.069 --> 02:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:05:32.550 --> 02:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
under the definitions that you then give
 
02:05:35.109 --> 02:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
later that that could fit within either
 
02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
c or d
 
02:05:39.189 --> 02:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
um and i i guess i'm not that's what
 
02:05:41.189 --> 02:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
kind of confused me is it
 
02:05:41.199 --> 02:05:41.990 align:start position:0%
kind of confused me is it
um

02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
i mean is it it may be perhaps it was
 
02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
the view that and and i i wouldn't
 
02:05:48.069 --> 02:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
disagree with this perhaps it would be
 
02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
the view that
 
02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
masturbation might be a
 
02:05:54.390 --> 02:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
more serious kind of
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
offensive touching than other kinds of
 
02:06:00.149 --> 02:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
offensive touches i i i i don't know if
 
02:06:02.550 --> 02:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
that's what you had in mind or yeah i
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
think that that is the general generally
 
02:06:06.709 --> 02:06:06.719 align:start position:0%
what we had in mind but i think the best
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
answer probably to give at this moment
 
02:06:09.510 --> 02:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
is that if we're going to be making
 
02:06:11.350 --> 02:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
other tweaks maybe we'll just work to
 
02:06:13.030 --> 02:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
clarify that
 
02:06:15.750 --> 02:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
okay no no that's fine that's fine
 
02:06:17.350 --> 02:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
and then the last thing and this is the
 
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
one that really is as i talked to you
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
about this is the one that is
 
02:06:23.030 --> 02:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
really um
 
02:06:25.830 --> 02:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
i'm very very concerned about um
 
02:06:28.709 --> 02:06:28.719 align:start position:0%
and that is the language on
 
02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
page 33 at the bottom on issues of
 
02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:33.189 align:start position:0%
page 33 at the bottom on issues of
credibility

02:06:33.189 --> 02:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
credibility
 
02:06:36.470 --> 02:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh that says a claimant statements make
 
02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry that says a claimant
 
02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.270 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry that says a claimant
statements

02:06:39.270 --> 02:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
statements
 
02:06:41.350 --> 02:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
statements made under oath shall be
 
02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
presumed credible
 
02:06:45.430 --> 02:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
unless called into question as uh
 
02:06:47.030 --> 02:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
described below
 
02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
and that i guess i mean i had you know
 
02:06:52.390 --> 02:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
one thing that that i
 
02:06:53.589 --> 02:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
i didn't mention in our discussion
 
02:06:55.109 --> 02:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
yesterday but it occurred to me since
 
02:06:56.310 --> 02:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
then is
 
02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
i think that this language or language
 
02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
very close to this was originally in
 
02:07:04.870 --> 02:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
an a version of the statute
 
02:07:07.510 --> 02:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
and it was removed um i mean i know i
 
02:07:08.709 --> 02:07:08.719 align:start position:0%
objected and i think there were some
 
02:07:10.069 --> 02:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
other there may have been at least one
 
02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
other person who had concerns about it
 
02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
but it was taken out of the statute
 
02:07:16.870 --> 02:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
um and i guess
 
02:07:18.310 --> 02:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
as i said to you yesterday the thing
 
02:07:20.229 --> 02:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
that really concerns me about this is
 
02:07:20.239 --> 02:07:21.589 align:start position:0%
that really concerns me about this is
this

02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
this effectively it seems to me
 
02:07:27.350 --> 02:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
places the burden of proof on the state
 
02:07:29.189 --> 02:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
it says that if
 
02:07:31.990 --> 02:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
if a claimant comes in
 
02:07:35.589 --> 02:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
and makes a claim and there's
 
02:07:35.599 --> 02:07:36.790 align:start position:0%
and makes a claim and there's
no

02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
um that you know that there's no
 
02:07:42.310 --> 02:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
evidence against the claim it has to be
 
02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
accepted so the default position is
 
02:07:46.950 --> 02:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
the claim
 
02:07:48.790 --> 02:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
you know if the the claim has to be
 
02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
accepted and that seems to me to be
 
02:07:53.030 --> 02:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
really contrary
 
02:07:55.109 --> 02:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
to the law in any other area that that
 
02:07:56.790 --> 02:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of
 
02:07:58.310 --> 02:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
and it just
 
02:08:00.069 --> 02:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
that that really concerns me i don't
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
quite see why you need that
 
02:08:03.990 --> 02:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:08:04.950 --> 02:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's very concerning to me
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question i know
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
we we
 
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
discussed this yesterday um
 
02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
a couple
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
points i would make in response to that
 
02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know the first is that
 
02:08:23.350 --> 02:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to remember you
 
02:08:25.350 --> 02:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
know this isn't an adjudicatory process
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
as much as it it's more almost like an
 
02:08:29.910 --> 02:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolution
 
02:08:32.550 --> 02:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
process so it you know we there's an
 
02:08:35.669 --> 02:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
initial stage in which a claim is made
 
02:08:36.950 --> 02:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
and the ag
 
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
designee can
 
02:08:40.629 --> 02:08:40.639 align:start position:0%
can review it and
 
02:08:42.069 --> 02:08:42.079 align:start position:0%
form a position
 
02:08:43.669 --> 02:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
based on the
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
the factors laid out
 
02:08:48.550 --> 02:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
and then if that there's no agreement
 
02:08:50.550 --> 02:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
it would go to to the administrator
 
02:08:53.109 --> 02:08:53.119 align:start position:0%
which which sort of functions as as an
 
02:08:53.119 --> 02:08:55.270 align:start position:0%
which which sort of functions as as an
arbitration

02:08:55.270 --> 02:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
arbitration
 
02:08:57.030 --> 02:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
um so that's the first i think that's
 
02:08:58.870 --> 02:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
the first point so it
 
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the burden of proof
 
02:09:03.430 --> 02:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
you know in arbitration there there is
 
02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
no burden of proof many times i mean
 
02:09:07.750 --> 02:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
both both parties sort of start out on
 
02:09:09.350 --> 02:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
on equal footing
 
02:09:10.629 --> 02:09:10.639 align:start position:0%
but the second point i would make which
 
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
i think is more important
 
02:09:14.149 --> 02:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
the way the language reads
 
02:09:19.350 --> 02:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
and the the subsequent language
 
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
effectively really just says that i
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
think it's effectively trying to state
 
02:09:25.430 --> 02:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
what was stated in the statute that
 
02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
we're trying to treat each victim with
 
02:09:30.069 --> 02:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
respect and dignity and that
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
their statements will be presumed to
 
02:09:33.109 --> 02:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
have credibility
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
unless there's something to indicate
 
02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:37.430 align:start position:0%
unless there's something to indicate
that

02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:09:38.790 --> 02:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
that they aren't credible or that
 
02:09:40.550 --> 02:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
there's a question around
 
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
around the truth of what they're saying
 
02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
and that can include
 
02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
lack of proof or problems of proof
 
02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
so i i think the scope of factors that
 
02:09:53.589 --> 02:09:53.599 align:start position:0%
could cause
 
02:09:55.750 --> 02:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
um the credibility of a statement to be
 
02:09:57.189 --> 02:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
questioned and maybe the value of a
 
02:09:59.030 --> 02:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
claim can go down
 
02:10:03.109 --> 02:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
to go down is wide enough that
 
02:10:03.119 --> 02:10:05.910 align:start position:0%
to go down is wide enough that
that

02:10:05.910 --> 02:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
that i don't think you end up with a
 
02:10:12.229 --> 02:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:14.709 --> 02:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
dispute a claim or reduce the value of a
 
02:10:14.719 --> 02:10:16.069 align:start position:0%
dispute a claim or reduce the value of a
claim

02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
claim
 
02:10:17.270 --> 02:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
either the ag designee or the
 
02:10:19.990 --> 02:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
administrator has to prove a claimant is
 
02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
not is not credible there just has to be
 
02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:23.350 align:start position:0%
not is not credible there just has to be
something

02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
that would cause that credibility to be
 
02:10:26.950 --> 02:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
caused into question and that something
 
02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
can include include a lack of proof so
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
i i guess that's i know we talked about
 
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
this yesterday we had a back and forth
 
02:10:35.750 --> 02:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
on it that
 
02:10:37.669 --> 02:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
that's the response i would give but i
 
02:10:39.669 --> 02:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
think that
 
02:10:41.589 --> 02:10:41.599 align:start position:0%
you know i understand the concern that
 
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
it feels like maybe we're shifting the
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
burden of proof but
 
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
but because this is
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
really meant to be
 
02:10:52.390 --> 02:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
an alternative dispute resolution
 
02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
process in which you start out with
 
02:10:56.709 --> 02:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
a claim and a negotiation and then
 
02:10:56.719 --> 02:10:58.870 align:start position:0%
a claim and a negotiation and then
potentially

02:10:58.870 --> 02:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
proceeding in front of the administrator
 
02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:01.109 align:start position:0%
proceeding in front of the administrator
that

02:11:01.109 --> 02:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:11:04.470 --> 02:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
is functionally a lot like arbitration
 
02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:06.069 align:start position:0%
is functionally a lot like arbitration
it

02:11:06.069 --> 02:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:11:07.830 --> 02:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
i think that mitigates i think that
 
02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
would mitigate that concern okay i guess
 
02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:11.189 align:start position:0%
would mitigate that concern okay i guess
i'm

02:11:11.189 --> 02:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
02:11:14.470 --> 02:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not quite i i i'm not quite
 
02:11:16.149 --> 02:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
clear why you needed it i know if you
 
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
took that if you took that sentence out
 
02:11:20.550 --> 02:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
and left all the rest in there don't
 
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
don't you get don't you get to the same
 
02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:23.510 align:start position:0%
don't you get don't you get to the same
place

02:11:23.510 --> 02:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
without the because i guess what i'm
 
02:11:27.270 --> 02:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
really kind of concerned about here is
 
02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:29.030 align:start position:0%
really kind of concerned about here is
this

02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
we have a statute that this is based on
 
02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
the statute doesn't have that kind of
 
02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:35.350 align:start position:0%
the statute doesn't have that kind of
language

02:11:35.350 --> 02:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
this it seems to me is kind of a
 
02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:39.030 align:start position:0%
this it seems to me is kind of a
substantive

02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
substantive
 
02:11:40.629 --> 02:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
modification of the statute and the
 
02:11:42.870 --> 02:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
thing that bothers me really is is that
 
02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
you know the implications of this
 
02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
for the future i mean is this have we
 
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
started down a road
 
02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
that says
 
02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
people who make claims don't have their
 
02:11:55.589 --> 02:11:55.599 align:start position:0%
don't have the burden of proving the
 
02:11:57.589 --> 02:11:57.599 align:start position:0%
claims and even though i agree with you
 
02:11:58.870 --> 02:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
this is we want this to be a very
 
02:11:58.880 --> 02:11:59.910 align:start position:0%
this is we want this to be a very
friendly

02:11:59.910 --> 02:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
friendly
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
you know uh uh
 
02:12:03.910 --> 02:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
claimant uh
 
02:12:07.510 --> 02:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
oriented process
 
02:12:09.830 --> 02:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's saying one thing to
 
02:12:12.629 --> 02:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
say that they you know that the burden
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
now sort of shifts
 
02:12:15.589 --> 02:12:15.599 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
that all you have to do is make the
 
02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:18.229 align:start position:0%
that all you have to do is make the
claim

02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
claim
 
02:12:20.629 --> 02:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
and if there's nothing else that the
 
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
default position is you win
 
02:12:25.750 --> 02:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
boy that's that goes
 
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
pretty far represent if i could uh ask
 
02:12:30.550 --> 02:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
the lba
 
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
to go back through all the changes that
 
02:12:35.189 --> 02:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
we made to this
 
02:12:38.470 --> 02:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
and let us know if in fact this
 
02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:40.629 align:start position:0%
and let us know if in fact this
particular

02:12:40.629 --> 02:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
particular
 
02:12:44.470 --> 02:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:46.310 --> 02:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
we can do that yeah i don't know just in
 
02:12:48.229 --> 02:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
just a moment i don't i don't know if
 
02:12:50.310 --> 02:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying that i don't want to say
 
02:12:51.750 --> 02:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
that you know it
 
02:12:53.589 --> 02:12:53.599 align:start position:0%
that this was not wanted but i mean it
 
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
was i understand
 
02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
about the burden of and i do i remember
 
02:13:01.350 --> 02:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
that concept was in one of the drafts of
 
02:13:03.510 --> 02:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
the legislation we'll just we'll ask the
 
02:13:05.350 --> 02:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
lba to find it
 
02:13:08.470 --> 02:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
um okay so i mean we can argue this all
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
afternoon and uh yeah no no that's but
 
02:13:12.310 --> 02:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
that that's really that was really i
 
02:13:13.830 --> 02:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
understand your position and i you know
 
02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599 align:start position:0%
i hope you understand mine i'm just very
 
02:13:17.510 --> 02:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
troubled by that um
 
02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:18.470 align:start position:0%
troubled by that um
uh

02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
i think other than that um that those
 
02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
were my question and as i say on on
 
02:13:27.189 --> 02:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh on balance i think the way you know
 
02:13:29.189 --> 02:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
overall i think this was really a really
 
02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
excellent job and with this one caveat
 
02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
of that one area i'm i think it's
 
02:13:38.149 --> 02:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
i'm very satisfied with thank you
 
02:13:38.159 --> 02:13:47.350 align:start position:0%
i'm very satisfied with thank you
representative

02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you want me to say that i
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
went through the whole thing and i did
 
02:13:52.950 --> 02:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
find a proofing error i did actually
 
02:13:55.910 --> 02:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
file a claim and found it uh reasonably
 
02:13:55.920 --> 02:13:56.950 align:start position:0%
file a claim and found it uh reasonably
uh

02:13:56.950 --> 02:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:58.390 --> 02:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
easy to do in terms of putting in
 
02:13:59.910 --> 02:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
numbers and doing the calculations and
 
02:14:01.669 --> 02:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
following through the whole process
 
02:14:01.679 --> 02:14:02.390 align:start position:0%
following through the whole process
um

02:14:02.390 --> 02:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:04.149 --> 02:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
as far as the beginning i mean the
 
02:14:05.910 --> 02:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
questions here i think we're valid but i
 
02:14:08.149 --> 02:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
think most of what they did was was was
 
02:14:09.990 --> 02:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
quite good and quite honestly i think
 
02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's really they're the experts i don't
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
consider myself an expert in terms of
 
02:14:16.390 --> 02:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
what numbers you put in regarding
 
02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
particular types of incidents and that
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:24.390 --> 02:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
representative wallner
 
02:14:25.589 --> 02:14:25.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:28.870 --> 02:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you attorney general for
 
02:14:31.030 --> 02:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
what i'm sure was an incredible amount
 
02:14:33.430 --> 02:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
of work putting this all together
 
02:14:35.669 --> 02:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
um and i agree with a lot of the things
 
02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
that have already been said um
 
02:14:38.079 --> 02:14:39.270 align:start position:0%
that have already been said um
certainly

02:14:39.270 --> 02:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
02:14:42.790 --> 02:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
um i was disappointed to hear that uh
 
02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
the claimant's counsel had not engaged
 
02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
in this um and had not worked with you
 
02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:49.830 align:start position:0%
in this um and had not worked with you
around

02:14:49.830 --> 02:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
around
 
02:14:52.149 --> 02:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
developing this and i wondered at what
 
02:14:54.470 --> 02:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
point were they provided
 
02:14:56.790 --> 02:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
was it only after
 
02:14:58.470 --> 02:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
it was published
 
02:15:00.390 --> 02:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
that we waited for them to engage or
 
02:15:01.830 --> 02:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
were they
 
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:07.109 align:start position:0%
 
they

02:15:07.109 --> 02:15:07.119 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:15:09.189 --> 02:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
all claimants counsel were provided the
 
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
initial drafts that we came up with in
 
02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
june i forget the exact date but we
 
02:15:15.910 --> 02:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
tried to
 
02:15:18.069 --> 02:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
we worked very hard to get some initial
 
02:15:20.149 --> 02:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
drafts together quickly because we felt
 
02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
that there was enough here that the best
 
02:15:24.629 --> 02:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
way to work with this was to get
 
02:15:26.470 --> 02:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
something down as an initial draft and
 
02:15:27.910 --> 02:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
send it out
 
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
to see what folks thought and then so
 
02:15:32.229 --> 02:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
they were provided the initial drafts in
 
02:15:35.350 --> 02:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
in june we continued to follow up and we
 
02:15:36.709 --> 02:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
did provide
 
02:15:39.750 --> 02:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
up an up at least one updated draft
 
02:15:42.229 --> 02:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
before we submitted it to the fiscal
 
02:15:44.709 --> 02:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
committee so an updated draft to again
 
02:15:47.589 --> 02:15:47.599 align:start position:0%
solicit feedback uh the one thing i do
 
02:15:49.589 --> 02:15:49.599 align:start position:0%
want to clarify just on
 
02:15:51.990 --> 02:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
we've gotten you know very lit really no
 
02:15:54.310 --> 02:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
engagement from claimants counsel but
 
02:15:55.830 --> 02:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
i should also say that with the
 
02:15:59.030 --> 02:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
exception of of nixon peabody and
 
02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:00.069 align:start position:0%
exception of of nixon peabody and
with

02:16:00.069 --> 02:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:16:01.990 --> 02:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
some back and forth we had with the
 
02:16:04.550 --> 02:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
association of trial lawyers we also
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
didn't receive a lot of opposition so um
 
02:16:10.950 --> 02:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
i just i just want to note that so that
 
02:16:12.790 --> 02:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
when i say lack of engagement i kind of
 
02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
mean lack of engagement in that just not
 
02:16:19.030 --> 02:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
for most of them it's not as if they
 
02:16:20.790 --> 02:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
said we don't like this at all so we're
 
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
not working with you we just didn't get
 
02:16:23.750 --> 02:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of feedback
 
02:16:25.830 --> 02:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
i say that only to note that for the
 
02:16:28.390 --> 02:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
some of the claimants counsel out there
 
02:16:30.310 --> 02:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
it's just as likely that indicates they
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
think it's okay as as it indicates they
 
02:16:36.469 --> 02:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
think it's not okay we just don't know
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you for that um
 
02:16:42.150 --> 02:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm i'm also concerned about the
 
02:16:44.230 --> 02:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
conflict how complicated this is it's
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
sort of it feels to me like um
 
02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:48.070 align:start position:0%
sort of it feels to me like um
someone

02:16:48.070 --> 02:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
someone
 
02:16:50.150 --> 02:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
taking a look at this process and
 
02:16:51.669 --> 02:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
thinking this might be something they
 
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
want to do
 
02:16:54.629 --> 02:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
um will
 
02:16:56.469 --> 02:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
by necessity really have to have a
 
02:16:59.830 --> 02:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
lawyer to do it so the chance that
 
02:17:01.910 --> 02:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
people would be able to really go
 
02:17:04.629 --> 02:17:04.639 align:start position:0%
through this process without a lawyer is
 
02:17:04.639 --> 02:17:06.549 align:start position:0%
through this process without a lawyer is
probably

02:17:06.549 --> 02:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:17:09.190 --> 02:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
probably not a good idea
 
02:17:10.870 --> 02:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
but also probably not something that's
 
02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
really within the scope of possibility
 
02:17:14.709 --> 02:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
for most people
 
02:17:17.509 --> 02:17:17.519 align:start position:0%
i did have just really a couple of
 
02:17:17.519 --> 02:17:18.709 align:start position:0%
i did have just really a couple of
really

02:17:18.709 --> 02:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:17:20.469 --> 02:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
technical questions
 
02:17:23.030 --> 02:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
on page 49
 
02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of questions this is
 
02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:28.629 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of questions this is
um

02:17:28.629 --> 02:17:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:30.870 --> 02:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
this is the claim form
 
02:17:33.270 --> 02:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
the last two questions i wondered how
 
02:17:36.469 --> 02:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
the answers to these last two questions
 
02:17:38.790 --> 02:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
play into
 
02:17:40.309 --> 02:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
all of this how
 
02:17:42.709 --> 02:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
how is this factored in the answers to
 
02:17:45.669 --> 02:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:48.309 --> 02:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
are we talking about f and g yes on page
 
02:17:50.709 --> 02:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
49 yes yep
 
02:17:50.719 --> 02:17:52.309 align:start position:0%
49 yes yep
so

02:17:52.309 --> 02:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:17:55.669 --> 02:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
for f you know the first
 
02:17:57.429 --> 02:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
the first thing we're we're looking to
 
02:17:58.870 --> 02:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
know is just and
 
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
and in many cases we might know this
 
02:18:02.870 --> 02:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
once we have the person's name or some
 
02:18:05.270 --> 02:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the info but
 
02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
we want to know whether there is a
 
02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:09.669 align:start position:0%
we want to know whether there is a
current

02:18:09.669 --> 02:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
lawsuit against the state
 
02:18:13.990 --> 02:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh because that will factor into whether
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
if depending on where we go with the
 
02:18:18.309 --> 02:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
process that there needs to be a
 
02:18:21.509 --> 02:18:21.519 align:start position:0%
either a temporary stay or ultimately a
 
02:18:23.990 --> 02:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
release of the or a dismissal of the
 
02:18:25.429 --> 02:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
current claims if there's a settlement
 
02:18:27.509 --> 02:18:27.519 align:start position:0%
through this process but
 
02:18:29.589 --> 02:18:29.599 align:start position:0%
i think what we're getting at with f is
 
02:18:31.509 --> 02:18:31.519 align:start position:0%
that if someone's already been
 
02:18:31.519 --> 02:18:32.870 align:start position:0%
that if someone's already been
compensated

02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
compensated
 
02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:34.389 align:start position:0%
compensated
for

02:18:34.389 --> 02:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:18:36.389 --> 02:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
through some other proceeding for the
 
02:18:38.790 --> 02:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
abuse they've suffered
 
02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:40.230 align:start position:0%
abuse they've suffered
then

02:18:40.230 --> 02:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
then they would not be eligible to come
 
02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
through come through this process and
 
02:18:46.469 --> 02:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
then um
 
02:18:46.479 --> 02:18:48.230 align:start position:0%
then um
similar

02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
similar
 
02:18:49.750 --> 02:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
i think similar
 
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
concept in in g have you already
 
02:18:54.629 --> 02:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
received any settlements from the state
 
02:18:57.190 --> 02:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
i mean f and g i think are related but
 
02:18:58.870 --> 02:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
have you already received any
 
02:19:01.669 --> 02:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
settlements the other key point with f
 
02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
is if someone filed a lawsuit and
 
02:19:06.790 --> 02:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
ultimately it was for that abuse and
 
02:19:08.070 --> 02:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately it was dismissed so that
 
02:19:09.349 --> 02:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
there was some sort of finding that
 
02:19:11.429 --> 02:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
there wasn't enough there that they they
 
02:19:13.190 --> 02:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
would not be able to come through
 
02:19:14.709 --> 02:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
come through this process and we we want
 
02:19:18.629 --> 02:19:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:20.469 --> 02:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
so on these two questions if the answers
 
02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
were yes they might be disqualified from
 
02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
going through the process
 
02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
is that right they may be
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
but it's also possible that
 
02:19:31.990 --> 02:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't need more detail i mean if
 
02:19:34.389 --> 02:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes we'd have to get more
 
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
detail behind that answer to know
 
02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
whether they'd be disqualified
 
02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:39.030 align:start position:0%
whether they'd be disqualified
great

02:19:39.030 --> 02:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
great
 
02:19:42.150 --> 02:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and i do hope that
 
02:19:45.190 --> 02:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
the council for the claimants will
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
that you will be able to reach out to
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
them and there will be some engagement
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
with them
 
02:19:56.870 --> 02:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:58.070 --> 02:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
02:19:58.080 --> 02:20:01.349 align:start position:0%
as you know
i

02:20:01.349 --> 02:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:05.190 --> 02:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
have this propensity to ask questions
 
02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
i will uh go through my list here
 
02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:12.630 align:start position:0%
i will uh go through my list here
um

02:20:12.630 --> 02:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:14.830 --> 02:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
my first question is
 
02:20:18.150 --> 02:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
um will the ag designee
 
02:20:20.389 --> 02:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
be required to stay in that position
 
02:20:23.429 --> 02:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
until all the cases are completed
 
02:20:25.990 --> 02:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
so that we have consistency
 
02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
as you said we needed
 
02:20:31.270 --> 02:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
the formula so we could have consistency
 
02:20:33.750 --> 02:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
so how are we going to guarantee
 
02:20:33.760 --> 02:20:35.429 align:start position:0%
so how are we going to guarantee
consistency

02:20:35.429 --> 02:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
consistency
 
02:20:39.190 --> 02:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
out of the ag designee
 
02:20:41.670 --> 02:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
i think the i i
 
02:20:43.750 --> 02:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
i understand the question
 
02:20:45.510 --> 02:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
and appreciate the concern i think the
 
02:20:47.110 --> 02:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
best answer i can give to that is we
 
02:20:49.270 --> 02:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
would make best efforts to ensure
 
02:20:49.280 --> 02:20:51.190 align:start position:0%
would make best efforts to ensure
consistency

02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
consistency
 
02:20:53.349 --> 02:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
in the person who's occupying that
 
02:20:53.359 --> 02:20:55.110 align:start position:0%
in the person who's occupying that
position

02:20:55.110 --> 02:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:20:56.630 --> 02:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
you know for starters we can never
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
guarantee that someone may not
 
02:21:00.469 --> 02:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
leave the office
 
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
and we also
 
02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:03.190 align:start position:0%
and we also
can't

02:21:03.190 --> 02:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
can't
 
02:21:05.510 --> 02:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
can't guarantee that that person may not
 
02:21:07.590 --> 02:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
have something come up or
 
02:21:09.429 --> 02:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
some other matter they just need to be
 
02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
involved in on a given day but we would
 
02:21:13.349 --> 02:21:13.359 align:start position:0%
make i think we would make best efforts
 
02:21:13.359 --> 02:21:14.309 align:start position:0%
make i think we would make best efforts
we

02:21:14.309 --> 02:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:21:14.319 --> 02:21:15.429 align:start position:0%
we
we

02:21:15.429 --> 02:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:21:17.910 --> 02:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
we understand the need and the advantage
 
02:21:20.309 --> 02:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
of of having consistency in that
 
02:21:24.309 --> 02:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
position i i'm mostly talking about
 
02:21:24.319 --> 02:21:26.550 align:start position:0%
position i i'm mostly talking about
um

02:21:26.550 --> 02:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:21:29.830 --> 02:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
putting them in a new position you know
 
02:21:29.840 --> 02:21:30.790 align:start position:0%
putting them in a new position you know
going

02:21:30.790 --> 02:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
going
 
02:21:32.790 --> 02:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
you know right now they're the ag
 
02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:34.230 align:start position:0%
you know right now they're the ag
designee

02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
designee
 
02:21:36.630 --> 02:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
and you really want them to be something
 
02:21:36.640 --> 02:21:37.910 align:start position:0%
and you really want them to be something
else

02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
else
 
02:21:40.790 --> 02:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
you know i would look
 
02:21:43.429 --> 02:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
i would frown upon that
 
02:21:44.550 --> 02:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
i would
 
02:21:47.110 --> 02:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
think or ask that you give them the
 
02:21:49.830 --> 02:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
raise or whatever it is
 
02:21:52.950 --> 02:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
and you know because i i just think that
 
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
consistency in this is going to be
 
02:21:58.950 --> 02:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
as important as how you
 
02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
do whatever you do yep and that would be
 
02:22:03.510 --> 02:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
i mean as with any position in the
 
02:22:06.150 --> 02:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
office that that's always my approach if
 
02:22:08.389 --> 02:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
someone's going to take a position we we
 
02:22:10.630 --> 02:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
ask for a commitment to follow that
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
position through and that would
 
02:22:14.309 --> 02:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
certainly be the approach here we'd have
 
02:22:16.469 --> 02:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
that discussion with whoever whoever
 
02:22:19.110 --> 02:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
might end up taking that position
 
02:22:19.120 --> 02:22:20.070 align:start position:0%
might end up taking that position
okay

02:22:20.070 --> 02:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:22:21.510 --> 02:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:24.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:28.630 --> 02:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
i guess that i'm i'm not understanding
 
02:22:28.640 --> 02:22:29.429 align:start position:0%
i guess that i'm i'm not understanding
why

02:22:29.429 --> 02:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:22:31.990 --> 02:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
the ag designee
 
02:22:35.270 --> 02:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
has any role in how
 
02:22:37.830 --> 02:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
we pay the claimant
 
02:22:41.510 --> 02:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
i mean we provided several options
 
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
isn't it just the
 
02:22:50.230 --> 02:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:52.630 --> 02:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
just just to clarify what
 
02:22:54.469 --> 02:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
what specific role are you referring to
 
02:22:57.190 --> 02:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
that the aeg designee would have well
 
02:23:01.190 --> 02:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
you said that the ag designee
 
02:23:04.950 --> 02:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
will advise the client on
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
how to receive the money i believe is
 
02:23:09.750 --> 02:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
it was
 
02:23:14.389 --> 02:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
and it it's in the written text and i
 
02:23:17.110 --> 02:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
don't remember where it is but
 
02:23:19.750 --> 02:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
i will find that okay and and get back
 
02:23:21.750 --> 02:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
to you because it was
 
02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
my understanding that the ag designee
 
02:23:29.190 --> 02:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
determined what the amount was
 
02:23:32.230 --> 02:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
it went to the administrator
 
02:23:35.030 --> 02:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:38.389 --> 02:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
agreed or disagreed or did whatever
 
02:23:40.230 --> 02:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:23:43.190 --> 02:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
they were paid as in whatever manner
 
02:23:44.790 --> 02:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
they chose
 
02:23:48.790 --> 02:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
but anyhow i'll uh i'll go back and
 
02:23:50.469 --> 02:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
and find that
 
02:23:52.630 --> 02:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
okay wherever yeah it's it's here
 
02:23:54.790 --> 02:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
someplace okay
 
02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:55.750 align:start position:0%
someplace okay
okay

02:23:55.750 --> 02:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:57.270 align:start position:0%
okay
um

02:23:57.270 --> 02:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:01.190 --> 02:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
i think you answered that on
 
02:24:04.930 --> 02:24:04.940 align:start position:0%
page 23 which is the uh
 
02:24:04.940 --> 02:24:06.389 align:start position:0%
page 23 which is the uh
[Music]

02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:24:08.790 --> 02:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
designated amounts or whatever it was
 
02:24:11.349 --> 02:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
that those are additives so i i don't
 
02:24:15.190 --> 02:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that
 
02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:21.590 --> 02:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
the legislation etc
 
02:24:24.710 --> 02:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
has focused on
 
02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:27.110 align:start position:0%
has focused on
employees

02:24:27.110 --> 02:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:24:30.340 --> 02:24:30.350 align:start position:0%
but i saw nothing in here
 
02:24:30.350 --> 02:24:32.150 align:start position:0%
but i saw nothing in here
[Music]

02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:24:35.190 --> 02:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
that either as a mitigating circumstance
 
02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:38.389 align:start position:0%
or whatever
if

02:24:38.389 --> 02:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
children to children
 
02:24:43.349 --> 02:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
abuse occurred
 
02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:49.110 --> 02:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just
 
02:24:51.190 --> 02:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
only if that
 
02:24:53.590 --> 02:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
happened at say
 
02:24:56.230 --> 02:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
at the urging or because of a staff
 
02:24:58.790 --> 02:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
member right of an employee if if an
 
02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:00.309 align:start position:0%
member right of an employee if if an
employee

02:25:00.309 --> 02:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
employee
 
02:25:02.790 --> 02:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
did something to encourage that or cause
 
02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
that to happen if
 
02:25:07.510 --> 02:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
if a resident just abused another
 
02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
resident that
 
02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
and there was no involvement in that by
 
02:25:13.750 --> 02:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
staff then that would not be covered
 
02:25:16.309 --> 02:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
okay i just yeah i know we didn't put it
 
02:25:18.870 --> 02:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
in the legislation i just didn't know
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
if it would be considered one of the
 
02:25:24.150 --> 02:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
and i guess the answer is no if it's
 
02:25:29.190 --> 02:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
just child to child right okay
 
02:25:30.950 --> 02:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:35.510 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:40.469 --> 02:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
do we have any idea
 
02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
the approximate length of time in
 
02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:46.469 align:start position:0%
the approximate length of time in
detention

02:25:46.469 --> 02:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:46.479 --> 02:25:47.429 align:start position:0%
 
of

02:25:47.429 --> 02:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:25:47.439 --> 02:25:48.630 align:start position:0%
of
people

02:25:48.630 --> 02:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:25:50.150 --> 02:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
you know in other words
 
02:25:54.550 --> 02:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
if i was in detention for six months
 
02:25:57.590 --> 02:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know in order to get to the number
 
02:25:57.600 --> 02:25:58.870 align:start position:0%
you know in order to get to the number
15

02:25:58.870 --> 02:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
15
 
02:26:01.190 --> 02:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
i would have to have been abused quite
 
02:26:04.710 --> 02:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
frequently like every other day almost
 
02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:05.750 align:start position:0%
frequently like every other day almost
um

02:26:05.750 --> 02:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:10.710 --> 02:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
but if i was in detention for two years
 
02:26:11.990 --> 02:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know that
 
02:26:15.510 --> 02:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:18.389 --> 02:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
you know could possibly occur and i
 
02:26:19.590 --> 02:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
i saw
 
02:26:21.590 --> 02:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
nothing in here
 
02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:22.550 align:start position:0%
nothing in here
that

02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:26:24.469 --> 02:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
related to
 
02:26:27.190 --> 02:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
length of time of either
 
02:26:29.270 --> 02:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
well they call it detention or
 
02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:32.550 align:start position:0%
well they call it detention or
incarceration

02:26:32.550 --> 02:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
so we
 
02:26:36.469 --> 02:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
02:26:36.479 --> 02:26:37.429 align:start position:0%
we don't
have

02:26:37.429 --> 02:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:26:38.710 --> 02:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
say an
 
02:26:40.150 --> 02:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
we don't have a lot of detailed
 
02:26:42.710 --> 02:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
information on that or we don't we've
 
02:26:45.510 --> 02:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
not calculated an average say time of
 
02:26:45.520 --> 02:26:46.790 align:start position:0%
not calculated an average say time of
detention

02:26:46.790 --> 02:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
detention
 
02:26:48.630 --> 02:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
we will
 
02:26:51.590 --> 02:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
we we could probably put together some
 
02:26:51.600 --> 02:26:52.790 align:start position:0%
we we could probably put together some
sense

02:26:52.790 --> 02:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
sense
 
02:26:55.349 --> 02:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
of how long each person has
 
02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
has been in ydc if we depend on how much
 
02:27:00.150 --> 02:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
information we have about them
 
02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:01.270 align:start position:0%
information we have about them
um

02:27:01.270 --> 02:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:02.550 --> 02:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
but we don't
 
02:27:04.790 --> 02:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
we have not
 
02:27:07.750 --> 02:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
put that as a factor in here in any way
 
02:27:09.429 --> 02:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
it seems like what you're getting at is
 
02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
have we factored
 
02:27:13.270 --> 02:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
factored in anything around you know if
 
02:27:14.790 --> 02:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
you had say two incidents but they were
 
02:27:16.309 --> 02:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
a year apart i suppose if you have two
 
02:27:18.469 --> 02:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
instances if they were a day apart
 
02:27:20.389 --> 02:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
um that that isn't a factor as in the
 
02:27:22.550 --> 02:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
guidelines as we've developed them but
 
02:27:25.429 --> 02:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head i do not
 
02:27:27.670 --> 02:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
i do not know say what the average
 
02:27:29.990 --> 02:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
amount of time is that someone's been
 
02:27:31.910 --> 02:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
someone has been in ydc across the
 
02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
spectrum of all of the claimants yeah i
 
02:27:38.309 --> 02:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
i got that okay well it was
 
02:27:41.110 --> 02:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
it was just a concern that you know i
 
02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:42.830 align:start position:0%
it was just a concern that you know i
have

02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:27:45.830 --> 02:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
um i think someone else mentioned
 
02:27:47.389 --> 02:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
something about the
 
02:27:49.830 --> 02:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
non-substantive changes
 
02:27:52.150 --> 02:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
and i would um
 
02:27:54.550 --> 02:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
like to recommend that
 
02:27:59.590 --> 02:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:02.630 --> 02:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
at least as an information item
 
02:28:04.290 --> 02:28:04.300 align:start position:0%
okay so that um
 
02:28:04.300 --> 02:28:06.309 align:start position:0%
okay so that um
[Music]

02:28:06.309 --> 02:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
what may be
 
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
non-substantial to you
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
may be of concern to us so i would just
 
02:28:18.070 --> 02:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:24.550 --> 02:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
you talked
 
02:28:28.150 --> 02:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
or well people
 
02:28:29.630 --> 02:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
that are currently
 
02:28:32.790 --> 02:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
incarcerated i believe uh senator
 
02:28:35.590 --> 02:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
rosenwald asked about um
 
02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:36.950 align:start position:0%
rosenwald asked about um
notaries

02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
notaries
 
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
and uh and you answered that
 
02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:41.590 align:start position:0%
and uh and you answered that
so

02:28:41.590 --> 02:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:44.469 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:28:44.469 --> 02:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:47.110 --> 02:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
that was that was part of my concern but
 
02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:47.990 align:start position:0%
that was that was part of my concern but
uh

02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:48.870 align:start position:0%
uh
my

02:28:48.870 --> 02:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:28:54.469 --> 02:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:58.150 --> 02:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
how do they find a lawyer
 
02:29:01.270 --> 02:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
you know do they walk up and say
 
02:29:03.110 --> 02:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know commissioner hanks i really
 
02:29:04.870 --> 02:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
need a lawyer
 
02:29:07.030 --> 02:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
or you know
 
02:29:10.630 --> 02:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
because i was abused in ydc
 
02:29:12.870 --> 02:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
or how do they how do they get to the
 
02:29:12.880 --> 02:29:14.790 align:start position:0%
or how do they how do they get to the
point

02:29:14.790 --> 02:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:16.790 align:start position:0%
point
of

02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:29:20.070 --> 02:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
filing a claim and that's a i mean i
 
02:29:22.389 --> 02:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
have no idea if there's even anyone
 
02:29:24.469 --> 02:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
currently incarcerated but
 
02:29:25.830 --> 02:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
there may be
 
02:29:27.190 --> 02:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
but i i
 
02:29:29.990 --> 02:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
didn't really see a good procedure in
 
02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:31.110 align:start position:0%
didn't really see a good procedure in
here

02:29:31.110 --> 02:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:29:31.120 --> 02:29:32.070 align:start position:0%
here
for

02:29:32.070 --> 02:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:29:34.070 --> 02:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
the exception
 
02:29:34.080 --> 02:29:34.950 align:start position:0%
the exception
of

02:29:34.950 --> 02:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:29:37.510 --> 02:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
incarcerated people
 
02:29:39.510 --> 02:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
so i
 
02:29:41.590 --> 02:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know
 
02:29:43.590 --> 02:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
i i can tell you there are significant
 
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
number of these individuals who are
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
currently incarcerated and
 
02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
they for the most part have
 
02:29:53.510 --> 02:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
have the same attorney um
 
02:29:55.270 --> 02:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
i think in those cases you know the
 
02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:57.990 align:start position:0%
i think in those cases you know the
attorneys

02:29:57.990 --> 02:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:59.510 --> 02:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
they they were connected with their
 
02:30:01.270 --> 02:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
attorneys through other
 
02:30:03.429 --> 02:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
other residents so so kind of through
 
02:30:04.710 --> 02:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
word of mouth
 
02:30:06.469 --> 02:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
but to your question of for someone who
 
02:30:08.309 --> 02:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
is not already
 
02:30:08.319 --> 02:30:09.190 align:start position:0%
is not already
um

02:30:09.190 --> 02:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:12.230 --> 02:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
does not already have an attorney
 
02:30:12.240 --> 02:30:13.349 align:start position:0%
does not already have an attorney
i

02:30:13.349 --> 02:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:30:15.349 --> 02:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know what that exact process
 
02:30:17.429 --> 02:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
would be as to how someone might come to
 
02:30:19.110 --> 02:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
get a lawyer and that's something we
 
02:30:20.870 --> 02:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
could talk to
 
02:30:22.070 --> 02:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
talk to the department of corrections
 
02:30:26.389 --> 02:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:28.870 --> 02:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
residents often get lawyers so this this
 
02:30:31.349 --> 02:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
happens i mean and they
 
02:30:33.590 --> 02:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
i i just i just think we need to say
 
02:30:35.590 --> 02:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
something in here
 
02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:36.389 align:start position:0%
something in here
that

02:30:36.389 --> 02:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:30:38.469 --> 02:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
takes care of that it's not it doesn't
 
02:30:40.710 --> 02:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
have to be lengthy or anything but
 
02:30:42.790 --> 02:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
that we are recognizing that we have
 
02:30:44.950 --> 02:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
incarcerated people
 
02:30:47.830 --> 02:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
and the last thing last question i have
 
02:30:47.840 --> 02:30:48.790 align:start position:0%
and the last thing last question i have
is

02:30:48.790 --> 02:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
how many public defenders are we going
 
02:30:55.030 --> 02:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
well we have
 
02:31:03.990 --> 02:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
we've indicted 11 individuals
 
02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:05.190 align:start position:0%
we've indicted 11 individuals
so

02:31:05.190 --> 02:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:31:06.389 --> 02:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
i think they're
 
02:31:06.399 --> 02:31:08.630 align:start position:0%
i think they're
all

02:31:08.630 --> 02:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:31:10.389 --> 02:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
i'm not talking about the indictments
 
02:31:12.150 --> 02:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about
 
02:31:16.630 --> 02:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:16.640 --> 02:31:17.670 align:start position:0%
 
why

02:31:17.670 --> 02:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:31:19.830 --> 02:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
i i'm not sure why we we would need to
 
02:31:22.070 --> 02:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
use public defenders
 
02:31:25.429 --> 02:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:27.110 --> 02:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
the guy says there the gal says i don't
 
02:31:28.870 --> 02:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
have any money
 
02:31:32.230 --> 02:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
but i want a lawyer oh i see so okay so
 
02:31:33.670 --> 02:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
and and doesn't know whether they're
 
02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
going to get a settlement or not so
 
02:31:38.469 --> 02:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
yep and it would appear to me that if
 
02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
you go through the public defender
 
02:31:43.830 --> 02:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
role in this
 
02:31:46.710 --> 02:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have to pay attorney fees
 
02:31:48.790 --> 02:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
so i i think in that instance what
 
02:31:50.630 --> 02:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
someone would be looking to use is is
 
02:31:53.510 --> 02:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire legal assistance or 603
 
02:31:56.550 --> 02:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
legal aid or one of those organizations
 
02:31:58.630 --> 02:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
who may be able to provide
 
02:32:02.309 --> 02:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh free free legal assistance so but
 
02:32:02.319 --> 02:32:03.910 align:start position:0%
uh free free legal assistance so but
that

02:32:03.910 --> 02:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:32:05.349 --> 02:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
i don't have i don't have an estimate on
 
02:32:07.349 --> 02:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
that i will say for these types of cases
 
02:32:09.510 --> 02:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
it would be very typical for
 
02:32:11.590 --> 02:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
an attorney to take it on a contingency
 
02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
fee basis
 
02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
and so that does
 
02:32:17.110 --> 02:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
help a claimant who doesn't have means
 
02:32:19.270 --> 02:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
access an attorney i think most of the
 
02:32:21.349 --> 02:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
claimants we've seen
 
02:32:23.270 --> 02:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
are our claimants who would not be able
 
02:32:24.950 --> 02:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
to pay for an attorney on an hourly
 
02:32:26.790 --> 02:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
basis they can
 
02:32:28.630 --> 02:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
they can retain an attorney because it's
 
02:32:30.790 --> 02:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
on a contingency fee basis but
 
02:32:33.270 --> 02:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
well should we say public defenders
 
02:32:37.990 --> 02:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
know that that if if you
 
02:32:45.190 --> 02:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
want a lawyer you have to get one from
 
02:32:48.469 --> 02:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
on a contingency basis or something
 
02:32:50.070 --> 02:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
well so the public defenders would only
 
02:32:52.550 --> 02:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
be used for criminal cases so only
 
02:32:56.070 --> 02:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
criminal not for civil nope no civil
 
02:32:59.030 --> 02:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
no but what we do what we have provided
 
02:33:00.550 --> 02:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
in here is that the administrator should
 
02:33:03.030 --> 02:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
maintain a list of
 
02:33:05.110 --> 02:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
of attorneys who might be willing to
 
02:33:07.510 --> 02:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
consult with a claimant on a free basis
 
02:33:08.950 --> 02:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
so i don't i don't have to worry about
 
02:33:11.590 --> 02:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
the public defenders no well not in this
 
02:33:13.830 --> 02:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
context right i'm just talking about
 
02:33:18.230 --> 02:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
this because i i get concerned that
 
02:33:21.030 --> 02:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
that might occur there you know
 
02:33:22.950 --> 02:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
and you know where we stand on public
 
02:33:27.030 --> 02:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
defenders so oh yes i'll just uh okay
 
02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
so that is all
 
02:33:31.590 --> 02:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
that i have
 
02:33:36.070 --> 02:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:36.080 --> 02:33:38.710 align:start position:0%
 
else

02:33:38.710 --> 02:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:41.110 --> 02:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
represent or senator rosenwald can we
 
02:33:44.550 --> 02:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
follow up with other questions directly
 
02:33:47.349 --> 02:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
to the attorney general absolutely thank
 
02:33:47.359 --> 02:33:47.900 align:start position:0%
to the attorney general absolutely thank
you

02:33:47.900 --> 02:33:47.910 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:33:47.910 --> 02:33:49.670 align:start position:0%
you
[Music]

02:33:49.670 --> 02:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:33:49.680 --> 02:33:50.950 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:33:50.950 --> 02:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:53.830 --> 02:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
when i would uh if
 
02:33:55.030 --> 02:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
i think we
 
02:33:57.190 --> 02:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
are probably not ready
 
02:34:00.389 --> 02:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:03.190 --> 02:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
on this that i think
 
02:34:05.030 --> 02:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
you probably recognize that there are a
 
02:34:07.349 --> 02:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
few things that uh
 
02:34:09.830 --> 02:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
you need to
 
02:34:11.670 --> 02:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
change and fix and
 
02:34:16.309 --> 02:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:16.319 --> 02:34:17.270 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:34:17.270 --> 02:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:34:19.110 --> 02:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
representative emerick's idea of
 
02:34:21.510 --> 02:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
actually making it into three separate
 
02:34:21.520 --> 02:34:23.429 align:start position:0%
actually making it into three separate
documents

02:34:23.429 --> 02:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
documents
 
02:34:25.110 --> 02:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:34:26.389 --> 02:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:34:28.309 --> 02:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason
 
02:34:31.510 --> 02:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
and i also liked expanding the lines but
 
02:34:34.150 --> 02:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
that's something that that you can you
 
02:34:35.429 --> 02:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
can do
 
02:34:37.910 --> 02:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
so if i read
 
02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:39.670 align:start position:0%
so if i read
the

02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:34:39.680 --> 02:34:42.830 align:start position:0%
the
legislation

02:34:42.830 --> 02:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:46.230 --> 02:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
correctly um
 
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:34:50.550 --> 02:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
30 days
 
02:34:53.830 --> 02:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
from submission
 
02:34:53.840 --> 02:34:55.670 align:start position:0%
from submission
to

02:34:55.670 --> 02:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:34:55.680 --> 02:34:58.309 align:start position:0%
to
either

02:34:58.309 --> 02:34:58.319 align:start position:0%
either
 
02:35:02.550 --> 02:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:06.630 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
we received this on the
 
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
1st of august okay
 
02:35:17.510 --> 02:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
so our 30 days are up
 
02:35:22.790 --> 02:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:25.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:35:25.030 --> 02:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:26.870 --> 02:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
i guess that
 
02:35:26.880 --> 02:35:27.750 align:start position:0%
i guess that
if

02:35:27.750 --> 02:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:35:31.370 --> 02:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
i could get some kind of emotion for
 
02:35:31.380 --> 02:35:32.870 align:start position:0%
i could get some kind of emotion for
[Music]

02:35:32.870 --> 02:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:35:36.309 --> 02:35:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:38.469 --> 02:35:38.479 align:start position:0%
to meet
 
02:35:40.550 --> 02:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
on the 30th
 
02:35:44.070 --> 02:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
to go over the changes that we have
 
02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:46.790 align:start position:0%
to go over the changes that we have
suggested

02:35:46.790 --> 02:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
02:35:49.349 --> 02:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
that would give you
 
02:35:51.590 --> 02:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
20 days
 
02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:53.030 align:start position:0%
20 days
to

02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:35:56.550 --> 02:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:56.560 --> 02:35:59.910 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:35:59.910 --> 02:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:02.309 --> 02:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
that would you know give
 
02:36:05.030 --> 02:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
other people an opportunity to ask some
 
02:36:07.349 --> 02:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
other questions so
 
02:36:07.359 --> 02:36:08.469 align:start position:0%
other questions so
um

02:36:08.469 --> 02:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
could i
 
02:36:12.469 --> 02:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
have a motion to that effect
 
02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair i hate i hate to
 
02:36:16.469 --> 02:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
be difficult but i'm not going to be in
 
02:36:18.790 --> 02:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
town oh that's a very good reason to
 
02:36:21.429 --> 02:36:21.439 align:start position:0%
have it on the 30th
 
02:36:23.110 --> 02:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately it's something i i
 
02:36:26.630 --> 02:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
don't think i could when when uh
 
02:36:28.550 --> 02:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
when are you gonna
 
02:36:30.389 --> 02:36:30.399 align:start position:0%
so i will be i will be out of town on
 
02:36:33.190 --> 02:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
the 29th 30th and the 31st oh okay well
 
02:36:35.429 --> 02:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
then what's the 28th
 
02:36:37.670 --> 02:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
i think the 28th is a sunday oh good
 
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
good day for a meeting okay how about
 
02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:41.510 align:start position:0%
good day for a meeting okay how about
the

02:36:41.510 --> 02:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:36:45.750 --> 02:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
26th yeah whatever that friday is
 
02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:56.469 align:start position:0%
26th yeah whatever that friday is
okay

02:36:56.469 --> 02:36:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:59.670 --> 02:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
well the problem is is the 30 days and
 
02:37:02.230 --> 02:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
if we don't do it within 30 days then we
 
02:37:06.150 --> 02:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
have to give him a written reason why
 
02:37:09.910 --> 02:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
we could always withdraw it and resubmit
 
02:37:12.230 --> 02:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
i think if we did that
 
02:37:14.230 --> 02:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
then that would this clock would start
 
02:37:17.270 --> 02:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
again whenever we submit
 
02:37:19.190 --> 02:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
i i think that's a that's that's an
 
02:37:21.349 --> 02:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
excellent statement because
 
02:37:21.359 --> 02:37:22.070 align:start position:0%
excellent statement because
the

02:37:22.070 --> 02:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:37:25.429 --> 02:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
the time limit between now and the 26th
 
02:37:27.990 --> 02:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
is de minimis so this gives you more
 
02:37:30.469 --> 02:37:30.479 align:start position:0%
time and it also gives the board more
 
02:37:33.030 --> 02:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
time to address queries to you okay to
 
02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
get answers so
 
02:37:37.190 --> 02:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
you will send me a letter
 
02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
can we do that chris at this point
 
02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:41.349 align:start position:0%
can we do that chris at this point
okay

02:37:41.349 --> 02:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:37:42.550 --> 02:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:37:44.070 --> 02:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
the committee's made no action on the
 
02:37:45.510 --> 02:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
item the attorney general could withdraw
 
02:37:47.429 --> 02:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
it at any point
 
02:37:47.439 --> 02:37:48.710 align:start position:0%
it at any point
okay

02:37:48.710 --> 02:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:50.710 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

02:37:50.710 --> 02:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:37:52.550 --> 02:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
so per i guess maybe a suggestion would
 
02:37:56.230 --> 02:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
be if you tabled it at your meeting here
 
02:37:58.469 --> 02:37:58.479 align:start position:0%
and we can get you a letter
 
02:38:00.870 --> 02:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
later today withdrawing it
 
02:38:02.309 --> 02:38:02.319 align:start position:0%
that way it gives us a chance to get you
 
02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
something in writing as opposed to just
 
02:38:05.670 --> 02:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
me sort of saying it here
 
02:38:06.950 --> 02:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
that might be
 
02:38:09.750 --> 02:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
and then we will resubmit a revised
 
02:38:09.760 --> 02:38:11.750 align:start position:0%
and then we will resubmit a revised
package

02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
package
 
02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:12.710 align:start position:0%
package
that

02:38:12.710 --> 02:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:38:14.469 --> 02:38:14.479 align:start position:0%
addresses the feedback we've heard here
 
02:38:14.479 --> 02:38:15.670 align:start position:0%
addresses the feedback we've heard here
today

02:38:15.670 --> 02:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:38:17.990 --> 02:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
that that would be my suggestion
 
02:38:22.630 --> 02:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:25.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:38:25.110 --> 02:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:30.710 --> 02:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:31.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:38:31.510 --> 02:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:38:33.990 --> 02:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
so i think guess what we have agreed to
 
02:38:37.030 --> 02:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
is to take uh to table the item
 
02:38:40.150 --> 02:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
you will come back with a
 
02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:41.670 align:start position:0%
you will come back with a
resubmittal

02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
resubmittal
 
02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:43.830 align:start position:0%
resubmittal
resubmittal

02:38:43.830 --> 02:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
resubmittal
 
02:38:46.630 --> 02:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
and then we have now
 
02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:47.990 align:start position:0%
and then we have now
until

02:38:47.990 --> 02:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
until
 
02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:49.429 align:start position:0%
until
the

02:38:49.429 --> 02:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:38:51.990 --> 02:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
9th of september
 
02:38:53.910 --> 02:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
if you do it today
 
02:38:55.590 --> 02:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
if you wait till monday then we have a
 
02:38:58.389 --> 02:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
few more days yeah well we won't be re
 
02:39:00.790 --> 02:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
yeah it'll be a bit before we actually
 
02:39:02.870 --> 02:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
resubmit so i think i think you've got
 
02:39:06.710 --> 02:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
even more than 30 days from today
 
02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:07.830 align:start position:0%
even more than 30 days from today
okay

02:39:07.830 --> 02:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:39:09.110 --> 02:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
02:39:10.630 --> 02:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
so we'll uh
 
02:39:13.110 --> 02:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
we'll figure that out
 
02:39:16.870 --> 02:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
mr shea when uh when we get the uh
 
02:39:18.150 --> 02:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
the thing in
 
02:39:19.910 --> 02:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
so your intention would be to schedule a
 
02:39:22.150 --> 02:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
special meeting when it's
 
02:39:23.990 --> 02:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate to review the item once
 
02:39:26.469 --> 02:39:26.479 align:start position:0%
right yeah because i'm i'm getting
 
02:39:28.950 --> 02:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
concerned that our
 
02:39:31.830 --> 02:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
deadlines are approaching
 
02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
and that um
 
02:39:38.070 --> 02:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:39.750 --> 02:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
when you say deadlines you mean the
 
02:39:41.590 --> 02:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
september 9th meeting
 
02:39:43.429 --> 02:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
no i mean the appointment of the
 
02:39:43.439 --> 02:39:44.950 align:start position:0%
no i mean the appointment of the
administrator

02:39:44.950 --> 02:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
02:39:44.960 --> 02:39:46.070 align:start position:0%
administrator
that's

02:39:46.070 --> 02:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:39:49.030 --> 02:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
you know because cases or claimants can
 
02:39:50.830 --> 02:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
start filing one
 
02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
january yeah and notice has to go out
 
02:39:54.870 --> 02:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
november first
 
02:39:56.469 --> 02:39:56.479 align:start position:0%
so we'll be under a pretty
 
02:39:59.910 --> 02:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:01.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:40:01.110 --> 02:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:40:04.150 --> 02:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
well that solved that problem
 
02:40:06.389 --> 02:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
so we'll uh
 
02:40:08.230 --> 02:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
we'll meet again and
 
02:40:10.070 --> 02:40:10.080 align:start position:0%

02:40:12.550 --> 02:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
november or we won't but we're still
 
02:40:15.670 --> 02:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:17.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:40:17.190 --> 02:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:40:19.510 --> 02:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
adjourned thank you
