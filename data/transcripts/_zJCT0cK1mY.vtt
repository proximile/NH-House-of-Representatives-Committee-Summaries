like to run through it we had planned to
 
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
do a little bit of a tag team on that if
 
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 align:start position:0%

so uh
 
00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 align:start position:0%
first page or second page page two
 
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
today's presentation way I would like to
 
00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659 align:start position:0%
proceed Mr chairman is to give an
 
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
overview of the judicial branch for the
 
00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of the members of the
 
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
division then talk about uh assessing
 
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
the branches needs and specifically
 
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about
 
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
um something called the weighted
 
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
caseload study that was performed in
 
00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 align:start position:0%
last year or 2022 then talk a little bit
 
00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 align:start position:0%
about how
 
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
we're trying to deliver Innovations in
 
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
the way we deliver our services to the
 
00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 align:start position:0%
state talk about our access to Justice
 
00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 align:start position:0%
crisis and what we're doing to remediate
 
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
that in our efforts to reach out to the
 
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
communities we serve
 
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
and we're open for questions at any time
 
00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 align:start position:0%
next page is our mission statement
 
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
I won't dwell on that but the committee
 
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
will have that
 
00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 align:start position:0%
um so let's go to slide four
 
00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 align:start position:0%
which is uh beginning of our overview of
 
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch the judicial branch
 
00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 align:start position:0%
is comprised of two trial courts the
 
00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
superior court and the Circuit Court
 
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
one Appellate Court which is the Supreme
 
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.689 align:start position:0%
one Appellate Court which is the Supreme
Court

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
Court
 
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 align:start position:0%
and uh we are all supported by the
 
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
administrative office of the Courts
 
00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to go through Court by
 
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
court and just give some background for
 
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I invite judge
 
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
king up here to talk about uh division
 
00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
good morning comes with division one my
 
00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 align:start position:0%
name is David King I'm the
 
00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 align:start position:0%
administrative judge as the chief just
 
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
said so the circuit court is uh
 
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
the quote where most people go when they
 
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 align:start position:0%
go to court in New Hampshire we have
 
00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
about 90 percent of the cases uh we have
 
00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
courthouses in 34 locations around the
 
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
state and we have uh the jurisdiction
 
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 align:start position:0%
that the legislature gives us and
 
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
nothing beyond that so you tell us what
 
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
we do and in many instances how long we
 
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
have to do it and how many days we have
 
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
to resolve the cases and we follow your
 
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
lead on that so you can see on uh the
 
00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 align:start position:0%
next slide slide seven my pages are off
 
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
our locations so there's a courthouse
 
00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 align:start position:0%
near you that was been that was the
 
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
mission of the old district court and
 
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
many of those locations are the same
 
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 align:start position:0%
we're in all 10 counties and many
 
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
counties were co-located with the
 
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
superior court but in a lot of the more
 
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
rural areas we have Standalone
 
00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
courthouses we are broken into divisions
 
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
which just to remind many of you were
 
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
here in 2011. representative Wiley was
 
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
chair of the finance committee at that
 
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
time when we created the circuit court
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
and what we did it back then is we took
 
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
the Probate Court which was Standalone
 
00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 align:start position:0%
Court the district court and the Family
 
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
Division and we combined them into one
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
it was a time of budget issues in the
 
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
state and trying to be good stewards of
 
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
the court of the state's money we felt
 
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
this was a way to create some innovative
 
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
ways to save money and we went at that
 
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
time from 115 clerks and deputies down
 
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
to 52 in a relatively short period of
 
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
time about three months actually and
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
we've been operating in that manner ever
 
00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 align:start position:0%
since but the legislature in creating
 
00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court kept the three
 
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
separate divisions so we have a probate
 
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
division a district Division and a
 
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
Family Division so
 
00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
from the outside it doesn't look much
 
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
different but from the inside we have a
 
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
lot less bodies than we used to have
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
particularly in management
 
00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:37.259 align:start position:0%
on the next slide slide eight you can
 
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
see where our cases come from we have
 
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
roughly 125 000 new cases a year in the
 
00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:46.139 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court to process and get through
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
the system in another 17 000 or so
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
reopened cases that come back whether
 
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
they are parenting cases or things of
 
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
that nature that have to be handled as
 
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
well each of those circles is a case
 
00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
type that the legislature has given us
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction to deal with on the
 
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
next slide are the judicial officers
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
that we have in the Circuit Court when
 
00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court was created in 2011
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
the statute specifically says that the
 
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
number of Judges shall be no less than
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
the number of authorized traditional and
 
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
Master positions at the time and so we
 
00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:23.819 align:start position:0%
always talk about the full-time judicial
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
officers and those numbers have gone up
 
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
in 2011
 
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
we had we were authorized for 45
 
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
full-time judicial officers at that time
 
00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
we had 13 marital Masters which are
 
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:37.860 align:start position:0%
which are in that number we now have no
 
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
more marital masses they're gone but
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
important for uh discussion this morning
 
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
I also want to remind you at that time
 
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
we had 29 part-time judges in the
 
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
circuit court and part-time simply means
 
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
that they're not a full-time judicial
 
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
officer with benefits they get paid by
 
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
the day or per diem but many of those
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
part-time judges those 29 part-time
 
00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:02.759 align:start position:0%
judges actually worked 224 days a year
 
00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
they just didn't get health insurance
 
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
paid vacation and the benefits that the
 
00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
full-time judges received so that was
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
the way that we were able to cover that
 
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
huge volume of cases today we're down to
 
00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
six part-time judges so while we have
 
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
more full-time judges than we had in
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
2011 we went we've gone from 74 judges
 
00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
who were people that we could call at
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
any given time to get on the bench and
 
00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:30.419 align:start position:0%
judge who it remembers those days now
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
we're down to 47. so when we talk about
 
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
the numbers and the and the need under
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
the weighted caseload study I just want
 
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
you to keep in mind that although we
 
00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:41.099 align:start position:0%
have all many more full-time judges we
 
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
don't have as many bodies as we had back
 
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
in 2011.
 
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
thank you judge king
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
chichester's NATO
 
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:50.820 align:start position:0%
give a background on the Superior Court
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you chief and uh good morning
 
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
everyone thank you so much for having us
 
00:08:57.769 --> 00:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
here today it's a pleasure to be back
 
00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
before you and talk about the court
 
00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:01.019 align:start position:0%
system I'm going to tell you a little
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
bit about the Superior Court
 
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and in the Superior Court
 
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
we handle mostly what we handle are all
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
a jury trial so that's where jury trials
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
take place and we have jurisdiction over
 
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
major felonies like homicide sexual
 
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
assaults burglaries theft drug related
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
charges and then we also have
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over civil cases that
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
involve medical malpractice car
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
accidents negligence cases and you can
 
00:09:29.449 --> 00:09:29.459 align:start position:0%
see the jurisdictional amounts in our
 
00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:32.519 align:start position:0%
slide on on slide 11 and we also handle
 
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor appeals from the Circuit
 
00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
Court Division and what I would always
 
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:39.300 align:start position:0%
say also say is although we have jury
 
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
trials that's the bulk of what we do
 
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
judges also conduct bench trials often
 
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
and those might involve complex civil
 
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
matters it involves planning board
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
appeals zoning board appeals contract
 
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
disputes non-competition Clauses and
 
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
those those cases require judges to
 
00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
issue orders that can be anywhere from
 
00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:02.519 align:start position:0%
four pages to 40 pages long and our jury
 
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
trials they can last from anywhere from
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
a two-day jury trial to a six week jury
 
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
trial if it's a homicide so that gives
 
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
you sort of a sense of of what we do in
 
00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:12.779 align:start position:0%
the superior court and you can see on
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
slide 12 we have 11 Superior Court
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
locations obviously you know there are
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
10 counties and Hillsborough counties
 
00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:20.519 align:start position:0%
broken up into two districts so we have
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
two locations in Hillsborough County and
 
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:26.220 align:start position:0%
that we have three clerks that cover two
 
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
courts they handle two courts so co-ops
 
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
and Grafton county is managed by one
 
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:32.820 align:start position:0%
clerk Sullivan and Cheshire county is
 
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
managed by another Clerk and uh belnap
 
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.250 align:start position:0%
managed by another Clerk and uh belnap
and

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
um Carroll County are handled by one
 
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
single clerk the rest have a clerk per
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
court so that gives you some sense of
 
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
what our court organization looks like
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
and then on slide 13 you can see our
 
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
annual filings they're a lot less than
 
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
circuit court but they're larger and can
 
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
sometimes be more complicated so about
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
seventeen thousand per year
 
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
and you will see on the next page that
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
we have 22 full-time Superior Court
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
judges one of them is the Chief Justice
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's me so I handle most
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
administrative matters but I also try to
 
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
sit a lot so I can be in the court
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
seeing what's going on understanding
 
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
what's going on when I was first
 
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
appointed back in 1996 the next judge
 
00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:21.899 align:start position:0%
appointed after me came seven years
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
later and since I've been Chief over the
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
past 11 years we've had almost 18 new
 
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
judges cycled through I think circuit
 
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
court has had the same sort of turnover
 
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:32.700 align:start position:0%
so we have a lot of new judges a lot of
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
new people to train and get up and
 
00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:36.899 align:start position:0%
running and one thing I will tell you is
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
that when I TR when I sit we have
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
another program that we started during
 
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
the pandemic called criminal mediation
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
and so I handle a lot of those where
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
parties have the opportunity to come to
 
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
a judge and talk for an hour or two
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
about their case and get it resolved
 
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:51.959 align:start position:0%
that way instead of waiting a longer
 
00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
period of time for a jury trial sitting
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
judges don't have a couple of hours to
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
take with uh with with the party so I'll
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
go to Hillsborough North or Hillsborough
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
South and do maybe six a day twice a
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
month and that helps to keep up with the
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
with the backlog so that's just a
 
00:12:08.569 --> 00:12:08.579 align:start position:0%
snapshot of what we do when we get back
 
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
to it I'll tell you a little bit more
 
00:12:11.449 --> 00:12:11.459 align:start position:0%
about treatment courts
 
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
thank you chichester's NATO so you've
 
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
heard about our two trial courts in
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court the Superior Court we have
 
00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
one appellate court it's called the
 
00:12:23.449 --> 00:12:23.459 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and on page 16 just an
 
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:25.740 align:start position:0%
overview we have five justices for
 
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
associate justices and one chief justice
 
00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
we sit in Concord we sit all year round
 
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
and the Chief Justice in addition to my
 
00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
judicial duties I have overall
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the judicial branch
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh the Supreme Court also has various
 
00:12:45.069 --> 00:12:45.079 align:start position:0%
administrative functions including
 
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:47.540 align:start position:0%
liaison with the bar association
 
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
development of core rules uh oversight
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
of various uh disciplinary committees
 
00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
and so on next slide you can see our
 
00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
filings from 2021 and I will tell you
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
that the data from 2022 are in we just
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
haven't made a slide our accused filings
 
00:13:07.009 --> 00:13:07.019 align:start position:0%
are going up there was a bit of a dip
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
from the pandemic but you can you can
 
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
see that we in 2021 625 cases were
 
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:17.660 align:start position:0%
disposed of one way or another
 
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
we all our arguments we had
 
00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
we had them yesterday they were all live
 
00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:25.019 align:start position:0%
and streamed they were before the
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic and they are continue to be and
 
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.449 align:start position:0%
pandemic and they are continue to be and
um

00:13:29.449 --> 00:13:29.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
everything all our opinions and orders
 
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:35.700 align:start position:0%
are also published on our website
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
finally that last element of the
 
00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
judicial branch I just want to give you
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
an overview of is the administrative
 
00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:44.060 align:start position:0%
office of the courts and our director
 
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
Diane Martin is here to give you a brief
 
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.990 align:start position:0%
Diane Martin is here to give you a brief
overview

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
overview
 
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.870 align:start position:0%
overview
19.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
19.
 
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:53.220 align:start position:0%
I come from the executive branch prior
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
to this role so I like to think of the
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
administrative office of the Court says
 
00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
Services mixed with the Department of
 
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
Information Technology throw in a little
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
bit of general counsel and some of the
 
00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
other functions it's it's somewhat of an
 
00:14:10.129 --> 00:14:10.139 align:start position:0%
unknown entity I think in the courts I
 
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
certainly wasn't aware of it but it
 
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
really provides all of the support that
 
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
all of the trial courts need to operate
 
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
so there are a number of departments
 
00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:20.339 align:start position:0%
much like executive branch departments
 
00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:23.339 align:start position:0%
although on a smaller scale that I just
 
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
want to run through
 
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
operations and audit so folks may not
 
00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
know that we have an internal audit
 
00:14:32.569 --> 00:14:32.579 align:start position:0%
division that actually conducts audits
 
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
of the trial courts and now is doing
 
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
um risk assessment of the whole branch
 
00:14:39.769 --> 00:14:39.779 align:start position:0%
and focusing on some of our AOC
 
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
departments as well we have an excellent
 
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
Auditor in the division who came from
 
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
the LBA prior to this so he's really
 
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:48.620 align:start position:0%
transforming that function
 
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
fiscal accounting and accounting support
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
are if you're thinking of executive
 
00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
branch agencies very much like the
 
00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:58.740 align:start position:0%
business office in a large in a large
 
00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.290 align:start position:0%
business office in a large in a large
agency

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:02.579 align:start position:0%
general counsel and government relations
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
we have a two lawyers in that office who
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
support the whole Branch as far as
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
providing advice and counsel
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
HR we have an HR department much like
 
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
Personnel within the department of
 
00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:16.139 align:start position:0%
administrative services that serves all
 
00:15:17.689 --> 00:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
of the employees
 
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
Communications very small office within
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
the branch to support our Communications
 
00:15:26.449 --> 00:15:26.459 align:start position:0%
with the public and members of the press
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
and then court security which is a very
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
large part of what we do in the
 
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
administrative office of the courts
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
on any given day about 150 Court
 
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
security officers that are either per
 
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
diem or full-time officers most of them
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
are per diem
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
and finally information technology and
 
00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:49.139 align:start position:0%
other unknown Department I think
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
um within the branch we have our own
 
00:15:53.329 --> 00:15:53.339 align:start position:0%
information technology department that
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
supports all of the technology that's
 
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
necessary to run the courts which has
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
become an increasingly larger function
 
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Diane judicial branch is
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
relatively complex with our location 40
 
00:16:12.769 --> 00:16:12.779 align:start position:0%
or so locations around the state 700
 
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
plus full-time employees so the AOC
 
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
gives us tremendous support
 
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:23.220 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to shift now and focus on
 
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
on some of the fundamentals about how we
 
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
staff and how we determine how to staff
 
00:16:32.329 --> 00:16:32.339 align:start position:0%
but first I want to talk about our
 
00:16:32.339 --> 00:16:33.290 align:start position:0%
but first I want to talk about our
budget

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.069 align:start position:0%
budget
um

00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:38.220 align:start position:0%
74 of our budget is Personnel we we are
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
people uh delivering an essential
 
00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:43.019 align:start position:0%
constitutionally mandated service to the
 
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
to the people of New Hampshire and as a
 
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
consequence as this division is well
 
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
aware when you're in the business of
 
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
personnel your costs are fixed health
 
00:16:55.449 --> 00:16:55.459 align:start position:0%
insurance retirement plan workers comp
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
in addition to those Personnel related
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh cost centers we also transfer or or
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
reimburse the counties uh for Deputy
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
sheriffs that provide security in our in
 
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
our Superior Courts and we also um uh
 
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
transfer or pay the department of
 
00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:17.900 align:start position:0%
administrative Services which provides
 
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
essentially our facilities
 
00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:24.179 align:start position:0%
there is a bureau of Court facilities
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
and we work with them and many of our
 
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
locals many of our locations are
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
actually leased so we have rental
 
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
payments to make
 
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
so that's the broadest overview of our
 
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
budget and the key point there is we are
 
00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:38.810 align:start position:0%
budget and the key point there is we are
personnel

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
and and the issue that I want to spend
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
some time with with the division is how
 
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
do we determine
 
00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:49.799 align:start position:0%
how many judges and Court staff are
 
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
needed to process cases in our trial
 
00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:57.320 align:start position:0%
courts our two trial courts
 
00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:02.660 align:start position:0%
and and to deliver in evidence-based
 
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
fact-based answer
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
did the judicial branch engaged in
 
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
something called a weighted caseload
 
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
study in 2022.
 
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.990 align:start position:0%
study in 2022.
so

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
um if you go to slide 22 there are there
 
00:18:21.529 --> 00:18:21.539 align:start position:0%
are a number of ways that that can be
 
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
used to determine how many judges are
 
00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
needed any any given Place uh you could
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
do it by population you could do it by
 
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
the number of cases that are filed the
 
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
problem with the last that latter
 
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:37.799 align:start position:0%
methodology is some cases are more
 
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
complicated than others some cases take
 
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
more staff time and more judge time to
 
00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
decide than others a complex felony
 
00:18:51.049 --> 00:18:51.059 align:start position:0%
trial a complex homicide takes much more
 
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
time than a relatively routine small
 
00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
claims case I mean that that is
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
seems self-evident and part of the
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
exercise the actually the essence of the
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
exercise of the way to caseload
 
00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
methodology is to tease that out to
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
figure out how much time we need for
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
staff and judicial officers in a in 14
 
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
given case types and that's the that's
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
what we went through last year
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
um the next slide describes the basic
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
methodology and I won't Linger on that
 
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
except to say that the key variable that
 
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
we tried to determine was the actual
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
number of minutes
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
required for either staff or judges to
 
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
deal with the 14 different case types we
 
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
uh on slide 24 we have a brief history
 
00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:48.419 align:start position:0%
of weighted caseload studies in New
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this methodology was endorsed
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
by this legislature in 2005. it's
 
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
actually embodied in statute
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
um the last weighted caseload
 
00:20:03.529 --> 00:20:03.539 align:start position:0%
methodology a weighted caseload study
 
00:20:06.409 --> 00:20:06.419 align:start position:0%
that was done the first
 
00:20:09.529 --> 00:20:09.539 align:start position:0%
uh one that was done was in 2005 that
 
00:20:12.049 --> 00:20:12.059 align:start position:0%
was also the last one that was done
 
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
our head count total full-time head
 
00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:19.160 align:start position:0%
count dealing with cases in 2005 was 482
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
and uh when we did our Study last year
 
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
to uh produce the most
 
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.289 align:start position:0%
to uh produce the most
trustworthy

00:20:33.289 --> 00:20:33.299 align:start position:0%
trustworthy
 
00:20:36.409 --> 00:20:36.419 align:start position:0%
results that is most most faithful to
 
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
the methodology which is you which is
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
used by court systems around the country
 
00:20:45.049 --> 00:20:45.059 align:start position:0%
we engaged something called the national
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
Center for state courts and I should say
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
just a footnote there that the
 
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
legislature did provide funding for this
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
study in 2019.
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
and we use that funding to engage the
 
00:20:59.210 --> 00:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
national Center for state courts that's
 
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
based in Williamsburg Virginia it's in
 
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
part A consultancy for state courts in
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
part a think tank for a small
 
00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction like us it's an absolutely
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
invaluable resource and they provided uh
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
they provided the the support and
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
guidance and and and ensured that we
 
00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
were faithful to this methodology
 
00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:21.539 align:start position:0%
they've performed a way to caseload
 
00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:24.419 align:start position:0%
studies for judges in 35 States and for
 
00:21:27.529 --> 00:21:27.539 align:start position:0%
staff in 24 States
 
00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:31.559 align:start position:0%
so on the next slide slide 26 as I said
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
the key variable that we we saw it in
 
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.799 align:start position:0%
this study was to determine by case type
 
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
how much time was needed by either Court
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
processing staff or judges and on the
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
right side of the slide you're going to
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
see one example for one case type which
 
00:21:51.409 --> 00:21:51.419 align:start position:0%
is small claims which is a case type
 
00:21:54.049 --> 00:21:54.059 align:start position:0%
that exists in our Circuit Court
 
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:21:59.390 --> 00:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
the basic elements are laid out in this
 
00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
chart we uh
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
we determined
 
00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
that during the data collection period
 
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
which was six weeks at the beginning of
 
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:14.090 align:start position:0%
which was six weeks at the beginning of
2022

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
000 or so minutes were recorded by
 
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
judges as dealing with small claims
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
cases there were 29 days in our data
 
00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
collection period and that
 
00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
if you multiply those two numbers that
 
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:39.140 align:start position:0%
that that is that means that we we spent
 
00:22:42.409 --> 00:22:42.419 align:start position:0%
770 minutes per working day on small
 
00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
claims cases
 
00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
uh for purposes of this study
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
we assumed
 
00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
217 judicial working days and I just
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
want to footnote that I'll come back to
 
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
it later okay
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
um so our Statewide annualized minutes
 
00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:02.220 align:start position:0%
for small claims cases is about a
 
00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
hundred and sixty seven thousand
 
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
um and then you divide that by the
 
00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
number of filings which during this
 
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
period was uh thirteen thousand about
 
00:23:15.169 --> 00:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
thirteen thousand five hundred
 
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
and you come to this number at the
 
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
bottom which is 12.38 minutes that is
 
00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
the average I stress that average amount
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
of time that a circuit court judge
 
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.870 align:start position:0%
of time that a circuit court judge
spends

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
spends
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.409 --> 00:23:36.419 align:start position:0%
so that you can see how that's a key
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
variable because we know how many cases
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
are filed every year and how many
 
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
minutes it takes for a judge to deal
 
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
with it so we know based on this data
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
how many judges we need just to deal
 
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
with small claims cases and it's about
 
00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:56.220 align:start position:0%
2.3 judges just on small claims in our
 
00:23:58.490 --> 00:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court and so we went through
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
this analysis across all these uh case
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
types 14 case types in both of our trial
 
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.549 align:start position:0%
types 14 case types in both of our trial
courts

00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:07.559 align:start position:0%
courts
 
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh the next slide
 
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.450 align:start position:0%
uh the next slide
is

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:12.649 align:start position:0%
is
um

00:24:12.649 --> 00:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
it just reiterates what I've already
 
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
covered the data collection period was
 
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
from January to March of last year
 
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
and we were fully operational as trial
 
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
courts then we had come out of the
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
pandemic although the funding was
 
00:24:30.649 --> 00:24:30.659 align:start position:0%
authorized in 2019 we wanted good data
 
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
um by the by the beginning of last year
 
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
we were fully operational and we felt
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable that we were going to get
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
good solid data out of it we also needed
 
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:44.220 align:start position:0%
the data back in time for us to begin to
 
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
build our budget because this x is the
 
00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:48.539 align:start position:0%
whole point of this exercise was to
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
inform our budget development process on
 
00:24:54.049 --> 00:24:54.059 align:start position:0%
the right hand
 
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
of this slide you will see
 
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
that is the actual instrument it's a
 
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
little hard to read but that's the
 
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
actual instrument that our our judges
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
and Court staff dealt with for the 29
 
00:25:09.649 --> 00:25:09.659 align:start position:0%
days of the data collection period and
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
they literally recorded their time by
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
so at a level Set uh where we were at
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
the time of our study we had I mentioned
 
00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:25.340 align:start position:0%
this earlier
 
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:28.740 align:start position:0%
514 full-time equivalents
 
00:25:33.169 --> 00:25:33.179 align:start position:0%
and this is judges and staff that deal
 
00:25:36.169 --> 00:25:36.179 align:start position:0%
with cases okay there are we have other
 
00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:38.220 align:start position:0%
staff that don't deal with cases we're
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
just focused on case processing staff in
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
our two trial courts and you can see
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
they're broken down by Circuit and
 
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
Superior Court
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
um I I call the division's attention to
 
00:25:54.289 --> 00:25:54.299 align:start position:0%
uh particularly the number of judicial
 
00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
officers in the circuit court judge king
 
00:25:59.690 --> 00:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
just told you we we have 41 now it was
 
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
actually 40 full-time judicial officers
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
in in
 
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:07.980 align:start position:0%
at the time of the study the reason that
 
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
says 44.32 is explained in the footnote
 
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
that as part of the study we included
 
00:26:17.149 --> 00:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
some of our full-time part-time judges
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
as well as child support hearing
 
00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
officers we have FTE equivalent of 1.77
 
00:26:27.529 --> 00:26:27.539 align:start position:0%
and we also had the one marital Master
 
00:26:30.649 --> 00:26:30.659 align:start position:0%
at that time so that I just want to call
 
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
it division's attention to that number
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
because I'll come back to it okay but
 
00:26:36.529 --> 00:26:36.539 align:start position:0%
this gives you a baseline of the staff
 
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
that we had at the time we did the study
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
next slide is slide 29 and I think all
 
00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
of us in leadership are so proud of this
 
00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:49.820 align:start position:0%
that we had over the course of 29 days
 
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
complete 100 participation by our judges
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
and staff so that means that our data
 
00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
have great integrity and uh it took our
 
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
staff are quite busy our judges are
 
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
quite busy and this was an additional
 
00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
part of the day that we asked them to do
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
but we do get 100 participation
 
00:27:15.049 --> 00:27:15.059 align:start position:0%
so on page 30 I want to begin
 
00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
summarizing the results of our report
 
00:27:21.049 --> 00:27:21.059 align:start position:0%
that was finalized in July and it goes
 
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
without saying if if the division wants
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
a copy of the report we will absolutely
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
provide it
 
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.610 align:start position:0%
provide it
um

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
the national Center found that we needed
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
a total of 500
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
rounding up 6
 
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
564 judicial officers and staff to deal
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
with cases so if our Baseline was
 
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
514 we need roughly 50 more judges and
 
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.470 align:start position:0%
514 we need roughly 50 more judges and
staff

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
that's broken down by Circa cord about
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
37 positions in Superior Court 12
 
00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
positions on the next slide you see that
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.289 --> 00:28:06.299 align:start position:0%
by our two trial courts the Circuit
 
00:28:06.299 --> 00:28:08.350 align:start position:0%
by our two trial courts the Circuit
Court

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
Court
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
concluded that we needed 65 judges
 
00:28:16.669 --> 00:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
for a difference of 21.3 and please
 
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
footnote that I'm going to come back to
 
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.510 align:start position:0%
footnote that I'm going to come back to
it

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
and in this in the Superior Court the
 
00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
study concluded that we needed three and
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
a half additional judges I won't spend
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
time on the staff but you can see for
 
00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
the most part we needed additional staff
 
00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:37.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
the next slide is critical
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
so that so the national Center concluded
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
we needed 50 additional judges and case
 
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
processing staff
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
but the study also concluded that our
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
clerks and Deputy clerks and managers
 
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
are doing the work of our case
 
00:29:06.649 --> 00:29:06.659 align:start position:0%
processing staff
 
00:29:10.669 --> 00:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
and that has it actually comes out to
 
00:29:10.679 --> 00:29:11.950 align:start position:0%
and that has it actually comes out to
about

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
57.3 full-time equivalent
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
Court processing staff work so our
 
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
Deputy clerks and clerks are in addition
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
to doing their jobs running courts they
 
00:29:27.289 --> 00:29:27.299 align:start position:0%
are doing
 
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
full-time equivalent
 
00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
uh Court processing staff
 
00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
so the basic number that we have is 50
 
00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.510 align:start position:0%
so the basic number that we have is 50
judges

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
judges
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
and staff
 
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
plus 57 staff is what the bottom line is
 
00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.370 --> 00:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
the next slide I might invite judge king
 
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
up here for to walk through the next
 
00:30:03.409 --> 00:30:03.419 align:start position:0%
slide which is 33.
 
00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
um we need to we need to True up
 
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
the circuit court judge number
 
00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.870 align:start position:0%
the circuit court judge number
and

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.789 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
it's the Baseline number that was used
 
00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:18.500 align:start position:0%
was 44.
 
00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
the national Center concluded we needed
 
00:30:24.909 --> 00:30:24.919 align:start position:0%
about 25 new judges
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
that needs to be adjusted downward
 
00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:32.940 align:start position:0%
and that is because of personnel changes
 
00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
and one very critical uh element of the
 
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
study that was not included which is
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
that we do have part-time per diem
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
judges there's six of them
 
00:30:48.049 --> 00:30:48.059 align:start position:0%
and so you need to back out the hours
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
that they work and the there they are
 
00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:53.940 align:start position:0%
variable each judge comes to us and says
 
00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
we're going to be I would can do 150
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
hours I can do 200 hours it depends uh
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
or 200 days I can it depends so the data
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
before you in this chart on chart 33
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
trues up the number based on that
 
00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
resource available to us and uh instead
 
00:31:15.529 --> 00:31:15.539 align:start position:0%
of 25
 
00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
that the national Center recommended
 
00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
that the number once you do the math and
 
00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
back out the resources that are
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
available to us is actually 17.
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
do you see that at the bottom of the
 
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.850 align:start position:0%
do you see that at the bottom of the
chart

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
chart
 
00:31:35.049 --> 00:31:35.059 align:start position:0%
did I get that right yes and so again
 
00:31:36.889 --> 00:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
members of The Division I think it's
 
00:31:39.529 --> 00:31:39.539 align:start position:0%
important to contrast where we are now
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
versus where we were in 2011 we have
 
00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
a very small number of per diem judges
 
00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
left uh one two three four of them have
 
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
been appointed to the Circuit Court and
 
00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:53.940 align:start position:0%
uh they're all at the end of their
 
00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
careers so to speak and they don't want
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
to work full-time they want to tell us
 
00:31:59.930 --> 00:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
how many days they want to work which is
 
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
fine and we're grateful to have the days
 
00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
but we really have been over the course
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
of the Circuit Court moving toward a
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
more full-time bench which I think makes
 
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:09.980 align:start position:0%
sense for the citizens of New Hampshire
 
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
more consistency and more predictability
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
and these three of these judges will be
 
00:32:17.889 --> 00:32:17.899 align:start position:0%
retiring shortly
 
00:32:21.169 --> 00:32:21.179 align:start position:0%
we schedule in the Circuit Court based
 
00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
on Judge days so the weighted caseload
 
00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:27.260 align:start position:0%
study tells us that we need 16
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
352 judge days in this calendar year 16
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
352 days of Judge time to move that 125
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
000 cases
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
when we put our schedule together for
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
2023 taking all of our full-time judges
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
the per diems that you see here
 
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:49.140 align:start position:0%
11 judges who are retired over the age
 
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:53.220 align:start position:0%
of 70 and another four senior active
 
00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
judges who are retired but can still sit
 
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
as judges and said give us as many days
 
00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:00.059 align:start position:0%
as you possibly can when we cobbled that
 
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
whole group together we were able to put
 
00:33:06.289 --> 00:33:06.299 align:start position:0%
a schedule together with 10 518 days
 
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
out of a needed sixteen thousand and
 
00:33:12.169 --> 00:33:12.179 align:start position:0%
change so uh I guess what that
 
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
demonstrates is we're significantly sure
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
of what we need to move that 125 000
 
00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
cases and when your constituents call
 
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
and say you know it's taken me two years
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
to get a hearing and a divorce case or a
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
year in a small claims case
 
00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.570 align:start position:0%
year in a small claims case
unfortunately

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
that's the truth and and I can provide
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
we didn't it didn't fit in the slides
 
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
but I do have a chart of the Circuit
 
00:33:36.409 --> 00:33:36.419 align:start position:0%
Court by case type we know how many days
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
each different case type takes and we
 
00:33:42.049 --> 00:33:42.059 align:start position:0%
basically have to triage and say all of
 
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
these cases have statutory deadlines we
 
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
have to do those and then those that
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
don't unfortunately get shuffled to the
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
side and we get to them when we can so
 
00:33:54.289 --> 00:33:54.299 align:start position:0%
picking up on that uh if you turn to
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
slide 34.
 
00:33:56.039 --> 00:33:57.350 align:start position:0%
slide 34.
uh

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:59.450 --> 00:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
depicts exactly what judge king was
 
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
the the circuit court is is a court of
 
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
Highly specialized jurisdiction with
 
00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:08.339 align:start position:0%
really detailed statutes that they
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
Implement many have statutory deadlines
 
00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:13.619 align:start position:0%
many of the case types have statutory
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
deadlines and of course our
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
constitutional and and some other case
 
00:34:19.369 --> 00:34:19.379 align:start position:0%
types have constitutionally required
 
00:34:19.379 --> 00:34:20.510 align:start position:0%
types have constitutionally required
deadlines

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
deadlines
 
00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
at the top you will see the statutorily
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
required the statutorily mandated
 
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%
timelines those case types have
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
statutorily mandated timelines
 
00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:35.220 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect domestic violence some
 
00:34:36.649 --> 00:34:36.659 align:start position:0%
won't go through the whole list but you
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
can see it there
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
so when judge king is
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
is trying to figure out how we take the
 
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
limited resources we have
 
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
and assign it to the work of the Circuit
 
00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:52.619 align:start position:0%
Court these case types go to necessarily
 
00:34:54.649 --> 00:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
go to the top of the pile because we
 
00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
need to follow the law so what falls to
 
00:34:59.530 --> 00:34:59.540 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the pile
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
divorce parenting small claims civil
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
inequity cases and if you go back to the
 
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
chart with all the circles on it you
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
will see that those are some of the
 
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
larger case types that the Circuit Court
 
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
deals with and it I think it goes
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
without saying that in a divorce and
 
00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:20.460 align:start position:0%
parenting case
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
um people want answers they want
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
hearings they want just to take an
 
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
example and and they are as judge king
 
00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:27.829 align:start position:0%
example and and they are as judge king
said

00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:35:29.329 --> 00:35:29.339 align:start position:0%
we're in a position where we're
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily having to delay scheduling
 
00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
of hearings in contested divorce cases
 
00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
just to take an example
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
um small claims cases also I I would
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
imagine you have heard from your
 
00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
constituents about delays with respect
 
00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
to that case type and it's just a
 
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
consequence of limited resources and
 
00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
having to triage based on these timeline
 
00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:54.300 align:start position:0%
driven cases
 
00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:55.980 align:start position:0%
right and the other thing that it it
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
really means in reality is we're trying
 
00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
to get to everything so a hearing and a
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
parenting case that really needs an hour
 
00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
hearing or an hour and a half hearing
 
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
you might get 20 minutes and that's all
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
you have because there's another one
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
right behind it so we're trying to move
 
00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
the cases but we're not giving folks the
 
00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
time that they really need to present
 
00:36:16.849 --> 00:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
their case it's not it puts the judges
 
00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
and the staff in a very difficult
 
00:36:20.569 --> 00:36:20.579 align:start position:0%
position but that's what we have to do
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
so I want to preview uh understanding
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
that the formal budget will be presented
 
00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
next month preview what what we've asked
 
00:36:30.849 --> 00:36:30.859 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch has unique
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
there's actually a statute that governs
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
this our budget request is supposed to
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
be a pass-through to to the governor so
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
this is a preview with respect to
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
judicial resources that we have asked
 
00:36:42.359 --> 00:36:43.910 align:start position:0%
judicial resources that we have asked
for

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
um overall I will say on page 36 our
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
objectives in our budget requests that
 
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
you will see is to begin to address the
 
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
needs in the way to caseload study we
 
00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:56.940 align:start position:0%
also need to
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
um we have taken a hard look at court
 
00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
security and we need to to enhance our
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
court security and we need to as the
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
rest of state government respond to the
 
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
inflationary pressures that we're
 
00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:10.940 align:start position:0%
feeling as an employer
 
00:37:14.569 --> 00:37:14.579 align:start position:0%
but getting back to the or focusing on
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
that first bullet the point on slide 37
 
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
you'll see our budget request based on
 
00:37:23.569 --> 00:37:23.579 align:start position:0%
the way to caseload study so we we've
 
00:37:25.849 --> 00:37:25.859 align:start position:0%
asked for seven judges in the Circuit
 
00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
Court of the 17 that that the study uh
 
00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
determined that we needed and one uh
 
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
additional judge in the superior court
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
of the three and a half that
 
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:38.569 align:start position:0%
of the three and a half that
um

00:37:38.569 --> 00:37:38.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:41.329 --> 00:37:41.339 align:start position:0%
the study determined that we're needed
 
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
case staff a court staff is really a
 
00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
critical uh Focus for us
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
um you can't it's one thing to add
 
00:37:53.089 --> 00:37:53.099 align:start position:0%
judges but if you don't have the staff
 
00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
that are supporting the judges and
 
00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
making sure that the orders get out on
 
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
time and and the hearings get scheduled
 
00:38:05.089 --> 00:38:05.099 align:start position:0%
it's it's ill-advised investment so
 
00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
you'll recall that we have 57
 
00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:12.359 --> 00:38:15.230 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
staff impounded in our clerks and Deputy
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
clerks across both of our trial courts
 
00:38:23.329 --> 00:38:23.339 align:start position:0%
we're asking just on that we're asking
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
for 31 new cleric clerical staff in the
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
circuit court and one new
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
Court Clerk and four new clerical staff
 
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chief justice I do have a question
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman as you know
 
00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
representative Lind has a bill in to
 
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
have a land use Superior Court judges
 
00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
would that be the one that you're
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
requesting or would that be an
 
00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
additional that that is the one where
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
we're the one okay thank you
 
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
while we're having a little short little
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
discussion are there any questions from
 
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
members of the uh representative Weiler
 
00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Mr chairman and chief
 
00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:05.810 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Mr chairman and chief
justice

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:05.820 align:start position:0%
justice
 
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
we've added some new courts lately are
 
00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
we going to have a problem with
 
00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.210 align:start position:0%
we going to have a problem with
courtrooms

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:11.220 align:start position:0%
courtrooms
 
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
no good
 
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
because that that gets pretty expensive
 
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:15.890 align:start position:0%
because that that gets pretty expensive
too

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.230 align:start position:0%
too
yes

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
we're we're confident we have the
 
00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:21.970 align:start position:0%
we're we're confident we have the
facilities

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:21.980 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
necessary to accommodate the staff that
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
and Court judges that we're asking for
 
00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
able to close one chord six figure here
 
00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
last time last style is now closed when
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
Consolidated those cases into Brentwood
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
so we've eliminated that expense very
 
00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
good thank you representative McGuire
 
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
has a question or two
 
00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:42.850 align:start position:0%
I have a page
 
00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:45.109 align:start position:0%
I have a page
[Laughter]

00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:39:48.589 --> 00:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
um so on the study uh I didn't hear you
 
00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
say how the numbers were created is it
 
00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
is it it takes us 12 and a half minutes
 
00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
to do this kind of case we have so many
 
00:39:59.810 --> 00:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
cases therefore we need that many
 
00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
minutes or is there any data involved
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
from other states right maybe in
 
00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
Maine it only takes them 10 minutes for
 
00:40:11.329 --> 00:40:11.339 align:start position:0%
this kind of case or something like that
 
00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
therefore maybe we could be more
 
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
efficient or less efficient they answer
 
00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
your question uh representative McGuire
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
is no we did not look at other states
 
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
um I I we the the basic variable was 29
 
00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.109 align:start position:0%
um I I we the the basic variable was 29
days

00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
of recording Time by judges and Court
 
00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
staff I mean they recorded by case type
 
00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:34.740 align:start position:0%
their day
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
and we took that and were able to
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
average out the minutes
 
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
um I I would respectfully submit I don't
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
know the comparative data I mean you're
 
00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
raised a good point but I and I would
 
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
invite any member of this division to
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
visit any one of our circuit courts and
 
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
and observe for themselves
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
um just the time pressures that our
 
00:40:59.089 --> 00:40:59.099 align:start position:0%
judges in both courts are under to deal
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
with these cases I think 12.38 minutes
 
00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
on average to deal with a small claims
 
00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
case is a highly efficient use of time
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
in fact I think it would surprise most
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
of the people of New Hampshire that
 
00:41:13.609 --> 00:41:13.619 align:start position:0%
that's all the judge time on average
 
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
that it takes for a small claims case
 
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you yeah thank you Mr
 
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
chairman so I mean it's possible that
 
00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:25.700 align:start position:0%
technology can provide
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
more productivity in certain areas right
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
I mean maybe things you're doing by hand
 
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
could be done on computer Etc right okay
 
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
let me ask specifically about
 
00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:37.849 align:start position:0%
let me ask specifically about
um

00:41:37.849 --> 00:41:37.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
the protective staff you said there was
 
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
150 officers that seemed like like a
 
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:47.220 align:start position:0%
very high number is it is it possible
 
00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:48.829 align:start position:0%
very high number is it is it possible
that

00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
um Capital Equipment could somehow
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
reduce that you know more doors that
 
00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
automatically lock or something like
 
00:41:59.109 --> 00:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
that yeah so just uh
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
great question let me just step back and
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
describe how we deliver security in our
 
00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.290 align:start position:0%
describe how we deliver security in our
courthouses

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:06.300 align:start position:0%
courthouses
 
00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:08.780 align:start position:0%
in the Superior Court
 
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
our courthouses are protected by County
 
00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:12.950 align:start position:0%
our courthouses are protected by County
sheriffs

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
sheriffs
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
and we the judicial branch pays
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
reimburses the county sheriff's for
 
00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
their time in protecting those
 
00:42:23.329 --> 00:42:23.339 align:start position:0%
courthouses in the circuit courts
 
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
for the most part there are some
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
co-located facilities we have a team of
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
court security officers
 
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
they are all overwhelmingly part-time
 
00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.250 align:start position:0%
they are all overwhelmingly part-time
employees

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:36.260 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
they tend to be retired
 
00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
um retired retirees
 
00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
um we have 34 locations to to protect
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
roughly uh with our court security
 
00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:54.980 align:start position:0%
officers we do need Capital Improvements
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
in in our courthouses to enhance
 
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
security and we've been able to access
 
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:04.140 align:start position:0%
actually some arpa money for that but
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
but you will see as part of our budget
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
some requests to enhance
 
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
the equipment that we need for our
 
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
officers in our courthouses but
 
00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
generally we need courts security
 
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
officers at the door and ideally in the
 
00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:22.990 align:start position:0%
officers at the door and ideally in the
courtroom

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
courtroom
 
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:26.220 align:start position:0%
to to deal with court security issues we
 
00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:27.430 align:start position:0%
to to deal with court security issues we
cannot

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
ask judge king to correct me but
 
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
certainly in the Circuit Court
 
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
while there's a hearing going on there
 
00:43:35.569 --> 00:43:35.579 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily a court security
 
00:43:35.579 --> 00:43:37.190 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily a court security
officer

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
officer
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
in the courtroom
 
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
I believe there is but the problem is we
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
don't have enough so there are days when
 
00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
a judge is in a courtroom by him or
 
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
herself without security the Securities
 
00:43:49.849 --> 00:43:49.859 align:start position:0%
primary responsibilities to cover the
 
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:51.660 align:start position:0%
front door but we did have a situation
 
00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:53.220 align:start position:0%
within the last 12 months where a
 
00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
disgruntled litigant in a family case
 
00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
showed up at a courthouse with a
 
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
automatic weapon and we had about a five
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
minute heads up that the person was
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
coming and there happened to be some
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
State Police in the building and they're
 
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
able to secure the door but we did we
 
00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
deal with very volatile situations and
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
chief justice Broderick used to say it's
 
00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
not an issue of if something bad is
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
going to happen it's when is it going to
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
happen so security is is it and the
 
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
chief justice has been very adamant
 
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:23.700 align:start position:0%
about trying to beef up our security and
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
we're very grateful for that
 
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:28.740 align:start position:0%
I mean by definition
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
almost invariably it's a bad day if
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
you're coming to one of our courts no I
 
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.750 align:start position:0%
you're coming to one of our courts no I
understand

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:36.910 align:start position:0%
understand
um

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
unless you're unless it's an adoption or
 
00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:43.079 align:start position:0%
a name change yeah okay thank you so I'm
 
00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
going to ask about the part-time judges
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
that there was a list of six or five
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
um but I I I I heard that I heard that
 
00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
in the past you had 29 or something and
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
that there was a pool of 47 so some of
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
these numbers didn't make sense to me so
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
at the time we created the Circuit Court
 
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
which was July 1st 2011 there were 45
 
00:45:05.809 --> 00:45:05.819 align:start position:0%
full-time judicial officers and 29
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
part-time judges okay
 
00:45:11.089 --> 00:45:11.099 align:start position:0%
the chief alluded to uh or maybe was
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
Judge Neto to turn over I'm the only
 
00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
full-time judge left on the bench at the
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
end of this week that was a full-time
 
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
judge when we created the Circuit Court
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
we've had about 50 appointments to the
 
00:45:23.329 --> 00:45:23.339 align:start position:0%
circuit court judge Lyons retires this
 
00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:26.220 align:start position:0%
week but back in judge Hewitt's days
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
there were 100 part-time judges that
 
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
used to be the model we've moved away
 
00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
from that it was certainly more cost
 
00:45:35.809 --> 00:45:35.819 align:start position:0%
effective but we've Consolidated courts
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
and we've we've gone two-way full-time
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
judicial model and that's what we think
 
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
is best for the state
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
um and so we have asked the governor
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
actually for part-time appointments just
 
00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:48.900 align:start position:0%
to try to fill the Gap because we have
 
00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:49.849 align:start position:0%
to try to fill the Gap because we have
funding

00:45:49.849 --> 00:45:49.859 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
but there aren't folks signing up for
 
00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
that we've been able to attract a couple
 
00:45:55.609 --> 00:45:55.619 align:start position:0%
of retirees who had left the law
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
practice and were you know I kind of
 
00:45:59.089 --> 00:45:59.099 align:start position:0%
twisted their arms and said don't you
 
00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
want to be a judge for a few years
 
00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
before you retire finally but from what
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
we pay them a per diem and for what I
 
00:46:07.849 --> 00:46:07.859 align:start position:0%
see hourly rates of attorneys and bills
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
that I see these days they can make
 
00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:11.460 align:start position:0%
pretty much in an hour what we would pay
 
00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
them for the day and so it's not it's
 
00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
really would be it's really difficult to
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
fill those part-time positions so I
 
00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:19.140 align:start position:0%
think it's not the model that we want
 
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
are you saying you have open part-time
 
00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
positions or not really uh the governor
 
00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
could have there are we went we had 27
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
we have six the governor could certainly
 
00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:31.140 align:start position:0%
make part-time appointments if he could
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
find someone that was willing to do the
 
00:46:35.089 --> 00:46:35.099 align:start position:0%
work the problem that we have if I have
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
a full-time judge that's getting paid
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
benefits I can say you know you're
 
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
you're going to Manchester that's your
 
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
you're going to be there 249 days a year
 
00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
but the per diem say you know what I
 
00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:46.740 align:start position:0%
don't want to go to Manchester but I'll
 
00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:48.180 align:start position:0%
sit in Concord but I only want to hear
 
00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:49.740 align:start position:0%
criminal cases
 
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
and I can say either yes or no I can't
 
00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:53.460 align:start position:0%
say no you're going to hear divorce
 
00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:55.740 align:start position:0%
cases so the per diem judges that we
 
00:46:57.410 --> 00:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
have are pretty picky about where they
 
00:46:59.210 --> 00:46:59.220 align:start position:0%
sit what days of the week they sit and
 
00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
what cases they'll hear and I'm grateful
 
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
for their service but I don't have a lot
 
00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:06.740 align:start position:0%
of Leverage to to over them
 
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
um how is the ending of felonies first
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
going to affect your expenses
 
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.370 align:start position:0%
going to affect your expenses
uh

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:17.700 align:start position:0%
another great question representative
 
00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:20.060 align:start position:0%
those are not baked into our data at all
 
00:47:23.329 --> 00:47:23.339 align:start position:0%
that was just not part of the study will
 
00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
it affect the Circuit Court absolutely
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
can you predict it's another 8 900 cases
 
00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:32.220 align:start position:0%
that will come our way on the way to
 
00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
Superior Court we'll obviously take
 
00:47:37.069 --> 00:47:37.079 align:start position:0%
judicial time and staff time to process
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
those and then they'll go to the spirit
 
00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:40.140 align:start position:0%
board where they'll go through the exact
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
same process the bail Herring and you
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
know the arraignment and
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
Etc so it's not an efficiency it's kind
 
00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
of the reverse of an efficiency
 
00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
okay so I take it you're not a fan of
 
00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
this well we worked very hard a few
 
00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
years ago to create and actually chief
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
justice Nano did the work but we agreed
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
with her and
 
00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
I'll let her she she can speak to it
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
much more articulately than I can I'm
 
00:48:05.089 --> 00:48:05.099 align:start position:0%
just sort of bracing for January 1st
 
00:48:06.589 --> 00:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
because I looks like it's coming back
 
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
and we're getting ready for it we have
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
to I see
 
00:48:09.599 --> 00:48:11.450 align:start position:0%
to I see
okay

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
um what um what fraction of criminal
 
00:48:19.609 --> 00:48:19.619 align:start position:0%
cases are drugs the main aspect of the
 
00:48:19.619 --> 00:48:21.050 align:start position:0%
cases are drugs the main aspect of the
case

00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
to 80 percent
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
okay and if we were to legalize
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
marijuana as a recreational drug would
 
00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
well you know I think in both courts uh
 
00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
it's okay chief if I answered try to
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
I think for the Superior Court it
 
00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make much of a difference it's
 
00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
it's mostly fentanyl heroin cocaine
 
00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine things like that
 
00:48:53.329 --> 00:48:53.339 align:start position:0%
assuming a static
 
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
situation I mean
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
if if one drug was became legal that
 
00:49:02.569 --> 00:49:02.579 align:start position:0%
might take demand more or less off of
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
other drugs right so I think there was a
 
00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
study in Colorado that proved that not
 
00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:08.460 align:start position:0%
to be true so I should take a look at
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
that again okay
 
00:49:10.319 --> 00:49:10.970 align:start position:0%
that again okay
um

00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:20.329 --> 00:49:20.339 align:start position:0%
are there any other members of the
 
00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
division that have any questions while
 
00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
we take a short question break
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh oh I'm sorry
 
00:49:32.329 --> 00:49:32.339 align:start position:0%
representing evil
 
00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for coming I was I
 
00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
was trying to figure out
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
um what's the how do you I'm trying to
 
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
get a handle on the Staffing shortfall
 
00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
due to budgetary concerns versus just
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
the general difficulty of attracting
 
00:49:52.079 --> 00:49:54.109 align:start position:0%
the general difficulty of attracting
folks

00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
folks
 
00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
it's it's an excellent question
 
00:49:59.690 --> 00:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
um we have a general difficulty in
 
00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
attracting folks our court assistants
 
00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:03.290 align:start position:0%
attracting folks our court assistants
make

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:03.300 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
between 14 and 15 dollars an hour we are
 
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
literally losing people to Dunkin Donuts
 
00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:12.260 align:start position:0%
and McDonald's
 
00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:15.980 align:start position:0%
we some of our
 
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
most customer facing public-facing
 
00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
functions have some of the highest
 
00:50:23.089 --> 00:50:23.099 align:start position:0%
attrition rates
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
to achieve efficiencies we want run for
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
both our trial courts in information
 
00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.230 align:start position:0%
both our trial courts in information
center

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
center
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
which is staffed by people who answer
 
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
calls from to deal with answer questions
 
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
about cases in both of our trial courts
 
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
there is uh I think judge king retention
 
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
or turnover rate of 60 percent among
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
information center two uh the entry
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
level position we have 70 percent
 
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
turnovers 70 percent
 
00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:53.220 align:start position:0%
turnover rate
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
so this is not unique to the judicial
 
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
branch it's something that employers are
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with and certainly state
 
00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:01.380 align:start position:0%
government is dealing with but to get to
 
00:51:03.049 --> 00:51:03.059 align:start position:0%
your question representative
 
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
it makes no sense and you will see this
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
in our budget to create a position that
 
00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:11.460 align:start position:0%
you cannot fill because the compensation
 
00:51:14.089 --> 00:51:14.099 align:start position:0%
is not adequate and we need to address
 
00:51:17.329 --> 00:51:17.339 align:start position:0%
that because it would be a pointless
 
00:51:17.339 --> 00:51:20.470 align:start position:0%
that because it would be a pointless
exercise

00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.370 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:22.380 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
um so that's you were focusing more on
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
the clerical folks what about at the
 
00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
there's there's no I we we I we have an
 
00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:34.849 align:start position:0%
there's there's no I we we I we have an
excellent

00:51:34.849 --> 00:51:34.859 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
00:51:36.829 --> 00:51:36.839 align:start position:0%
Judiciary in our state
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
and uh we are I'm not concerned about
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
the level of compensation for our judges
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
in terms of attracting uh quality Talent
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
we've had some excellent appointments uh
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
to the bench in both of our courts so
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's not a concern representative
 
00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
yes we are very lucky we have very
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
dedicated judicial branch and
 
00:51:59.690 --> 00:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
representative hatch I believe has a
 
00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:04.670 align:start position:0%
representative hatch I believe has a
question

00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:06.829 --> 00:52:06.839 align:start position:0%
come on here about the call center if
 
00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
there's a concern for retention there
 
00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:10.549 align:start position:0%
there's a concern for retention there
um

00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
didn't wasn't that very isn't that very
 
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
successful didn't that ease uh the
 
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
burden and for the entire court
 
00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and so uh the lack of
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
retention there is that causing severe
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
issues for the call center and do we
 
00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
need to look at waste for retention or
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
might be a dumb question but I I think
 
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
that concerns me hearing that it is uh
 
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
reps McGuire asked about efficiencies in
 
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
our system I would say that uh when
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
confirmed I was not Chief Justice at the
 
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
time but when the pandemic hit there
 
00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
were a couple of Investments with the
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
support of the legislature that had been
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
made that enabled the judicial branch to
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
Pivot and continued to deliver its
 
00:52:58.370 --> 00:52:58.380 align:start position:0%
services to the state of New Hampshire
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the pandemic and one was
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
the information center which was able to
 
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
go fully remote and seamlessly continue
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
to answer questions from from the people
 
00:53:11.089 --> 00:53:11.099 align:start position:0%
the other was investments in technology
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
we have electronic filing in many but
 
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
not all of our case types so that
 
00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
reduces that reduce the need for for
 
00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:20.300 align:start position:0%
staff and we also had
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know good investments in technology
 
00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
in our courthouses But to answer your
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
question representative the the ability
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
to staff these information center
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
positions are absolutely critical and I
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
think if you ask uh practicing attorneys
 
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:38.230 align:start position:0%
think if you ask uh practicing attorneys
or

00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
self-represented litigants in your
 
00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
District whether they've had to wait
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
online uh you know on the phone while
 
00:53:48.049 --> 00:53:48.059 align:start position:0%
getting their call answered I think the
 
00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
answer is going to be invariably yes for
 
00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
a long time and that is not something
 
00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
that we want that's not efficient
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
for our lawyers our citizens we need to
 
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
do better and that's not a function of
 
00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
people not working hard it's just not
 
00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:11.220 align:start position:0%
um so what
 
00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:13.140 align:start position:0%
I mean there's obviously interest to
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
this I mean buying the obvious such as
 
00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
pay and other things what can be done to
 
00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
address the retention problem or am I
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
looking at something that's not as big
 
00:54:25.609 --> 00:54:25.619 align:start position:0%
of a problem as it sounds to me on the
 
00:54:25.619 --> 00:54:27.290 align:start position:0%
of a problem as it sounds to me on the
onset

00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
onset
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
um you know what I mean I said is is
 
00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
providing that service uh jeopardized by
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
the lack of retention we we need to
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
address retention in the critical Factor
 
00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
there is what we pay them but we're also
 
00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:42.059 align:start position:0%
looking at other ways to enhance
 
00:54:44.569 --> 00:54:44.579 align:start position:0%
the if you will employee experience in
 
00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:47.300 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch and we are investing
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
very heavily in staff training which
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
we've heard from our staff that they
 
00:54:56.809 --> 00:54:56.819 align:start position:0%
really really benefit from and really
 
00:54:56.819 --> 00:54:57.650 align:start position:0%
really really benefit from and really
um

00:54:57.650 --> 00:54:57.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
desire and it makes it a more attractive
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
place to work just this morning we had a
 
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
two-hour branch-wide training session
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
where all of our employees were able to
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
get online and get trained on mental
 
00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
illness and how we deal with our
 
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
citizens who with mental illness who
 
00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
come into our courts
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
so retention beyond what we can do
 
00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:22.980 align:start position:0%
Beyond paying them more and that's going
 
00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
to be ultimately a an issue for the
 
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
legislature in this body we're also
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
working on
 
00:55:32.809 --> 00:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
okay does that answer your question I I
 
00:55:35.329 --> 00:55:35.339 align:start position:0%
see I'm just I'm just concerned that uh
 
00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
if I may if there is as
 
00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
big of a problem as I'll think of a
 
00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:44.460 align:start position:0%
problem is it it's a big it's a big
 
00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:47.220 align:start position:0%
problem so what do we need to do to
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
address that from our end I mean you
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
will see in our budget requests a
 
00:55:53.809 --> 00:55:53.819 align:start position:0%
request to increase the amount that
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
we're paying our court assistance okay
 
00:55:58.790 --> 00:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions at the
 
00:56:04.609 --> 00:56:04.619 align:start position:0%
moment Mr chief justice please continue
 
00:56:07.609 --> 00:56:07.619 align:start position:0%
um slide 38 will pick up and what I
 
00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
wanted to do spend some time for the
 
00:56:12.829 --> 00:56:12.839 align:start position:0%
benefit of the division is is address
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
some of the ways we're trying to be
 
00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
Innovative and better serve the citizens
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire people of New Hampshire
 
00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
and I first want to start with uh our
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
treatment courts and a true national
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
leader in the development of treatment
 
00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
courts is sitting to my right Justice
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
NATO who has led our effort with respect
 
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
to our drug courts and
 
00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
invite her to to spend some time with
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
the division on what we're doing thank
 
00:56:41.809 --> 00:56:41.819 align:start position:0%
you thank you Chief and thank you to the
 
00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:44.460 align:start position:0%
members again and I also representative
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
Weiler he's he was with me from the
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
beginning so I can talk about that a
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
little bit but I I want to talk to you
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
about treatment courts in general
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
because it's obviously something I'm
 
00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
pretty passionate about and you all the
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
legislature supported Statewide funding
 
00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
for drug courts back in 2016. and what I
 
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
want to tell you about drug courts is
 
00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:07.380 align:start position:0%
they are a way to manage a population
 
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
that we see constantly coming through
 
00:57:11.569 --> 00:57:11.579 align:start position:0%
especially the Superior Court this is a
 
00:57:11.579 --> 00:57:12.549 align:start position:0%
especially the Superior Court this is a
felony

00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
felony
 
00:57:15.890 --> 00:57:15.900 align:start position:0%
program and what we would see is people
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
coming through the system I would see
 
00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%
them over and over and over and over
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
again and they'd just get escalating
 
00:57:22.849 --> 00:57:22.859 align:start position:0%
jail and then prison sanctions and what
 
00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:24.780 align:start position:0%
we try to do with treatment court is to
 
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
Target those people the people that have
 
00:57:28.849 --> 00:57:28.859 align:start position:0%
severe substance use disorder not just a
 
00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
first-time offender and somebody with a
 
00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
lengthy felony record and instead of The
 
00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
Next Step being State Prison they enter
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
treatment court and treatment court is a
 
00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
way to combine accountability with with
 
00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:41.940 align:start position:0%
treatment in the community so people can
 
00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:43.740 align:start position:0%
actually learn to change the way they've
 
00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
been behaving over the many years of
 
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
their lives that they've been dealing
 
00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
with substance use disorder so when
 
00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
somebody is in drug court they plead
 
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
guilty to the charges that are pending
 
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
it's not just drug charges it can be
 
00:57:56.089 --> 00:57:56.099 align:start position:0%
burglary theft robbery anything that's
 
00:57:59.690 --> 00:57:59.700 align:start position:0%
related to their to their use of drugs
 
00:58:01.849 --> 00:58:01.859 align:start position:0%
they plead guilty they receive a
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
suspended state prison or suspended
 
00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
lengthy house sentence and then four
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
years of probation with treatment court
 
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
and the team that gets together is the
 
00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
same judge same prosecutor same defense
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
attorney same treatment provider same
 
00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:16.380 align:start position:0%
probation officer same law enforcement
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
officer same case manager they all get
 
00:58:20.809 --> 00:58:20.819 align:start position:0%
together every Monday or Tuesday and
 
00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
they review the 20 or so cases of people
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
that are going to come in and talk about
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
how they did the prior week so somebody
 
00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
in treatment court is receiving three
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
hours of treatment three days a week
 
00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
plus individual treatment plus random
 
00:58:36.049 --> 00:58:36.059 align:start position:0%
drug tests you know they have a chance
 
00:58:37.609 --> 00:58:37.619 align:start position:0%
of getting called one in seven chance
 
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
every single day they call a phone line
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
if their color comes up they get a
 
00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
random drug test they do case management
 
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
once a week they do probation check-in
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
visits so it's and they see the judge
 
00:58:50.329 --> 00:58:50.339 align:start position:0%
every week so it's a constant high level
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
supervision while we teach them to
 
00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
change their behavior and it's it's been
 
00:58:57.890 --> 00:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
pretty successful I I love to to quote
 
00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
the prior chief of Nashua who said at a
 
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
sort of a rotary Gathering once that you
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
know I have a hundred burglaries a year
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
in Nashua I know they're not committed
 
00:59:08.569 --> 00:59:08.579 align:start position:0%
by 100 people they're committed by the
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
same 10 people and eight of them are in
 
00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
your treatment court and my burglary
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
rate's gone down so to have a law
 
00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:15.900 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer with that kind of
 
00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
endorsement of treatment court and I'll
 
00:59:19.609 --> 00:59:19.619 align:start position:0%
you may recall but I'll remind most of
 
00:59:21.289 --> 00:59:21.299 align:start position:0%
you were on finance at the time it
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
passed in 2016 and it was a unanimous
 
00:59:26.089 --> 00:59:26.099 align:start position:0%
vote out of Finance which is something
 
00:59:28.329 --> 00:59:28.339 align:start position:0%
I've never seen before and
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler was with me when
 
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
we started one in in Rockingham County
 
00:59:34.849 --> 00:59:34.859 align:start position:0%
with only Federal funding the federal
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
funding ran out we had to go convince
 
00:59:38.569 --> 00:59:38.579 align:start position:0%
the county to please please please take
 
00:59:40.609 --> 00:59:40.619 align:start position:0%
it over and continue funding which they
 
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
did and I think that was a huge reason
 
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
why the legislature saw the value of it
 
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
also Stratford county is a strong leader
 
00:59:49.849 --> 00:59:49.859 align:start position:0%
in the treatment Court movement Grafton
 
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:52.740 align:start position:0%
County those are the two first-time drug
 
00:59:55.309 --> 00:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
court operators so it's a really
 
00:59:56.809 --> 00:59:56.819 align:start position:0%
important program it's something that
 
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
we've been growing we now have drug
 
01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
courts operating in 10 of our 11 County
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
locations we've served over 1600 people
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't sound like a lot but when
 
01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
you keep in mind that these are people
 
01:00:08.809 --> 01:00:08.819 align:start position:0%
that are constantly reoffending so they
 
01:00:10.609 --> 01:00:10.619 align:start position:0%
they account for a lot more of the crime
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
than just 1600 cases they're they're
 
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
people that would be headed to the state
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
prison commissioner Hanks tells me that
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
once drug courts rolled out a couple
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
years later she felt like her census
 
01:00:23.569 --> 01:00:23.579 align:start position:0%
went down a piece of that was the drug
 
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:25.799 align:start position:0%
court program also it you know it's hard
 
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
to tell is it helping the state
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
prisoners and helping the county jails
 
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
probably a little bit of both depending
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
on where somebody might be headed if
 
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
they didn't have an opportunity for
 
01:00:36.289 --> 01:00:36.299 align:start position:0%
treatment Court we also have
 
01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
um mental health courts that are
 
01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
operating in in many of our counties I
 
01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
think we have 16 mental health courts
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
many of them are in circuit court
 
01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:46.380 align:start position:0%
because they're targeting a little bit
 
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
different of a population it's the same
 
01:00:50.569 --> 01:00:50.579 align:start position:0%
model the same team approach the state
 
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
same response to behavior Jim Leary a
 
01:00:54.770 --> 01:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
circuit court judge was somebody who
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
spearheaded uh the mental health court
 
01:00:59.329 --> 01:00:59.339 align:start position:0%
in Nashua and he's become a model for
 
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
unlike uh drug courts there are no
 
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
National mental health court standards
 
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
so recent recently judge Ashley and I
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
worked with a group of of prosecutors
 
01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
and mental health coordinators to come
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
up with some New Hampshire standards
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
they're modeled a little bit after the
 
01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:18.059 align:start position:0%
drug court standards plus there are a
 
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
couple of states that have come up with
 
01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
their own so the mental health courts
 
01:01:24.289 --> 01:01:24.299 align:start position:0%
are not state funded they are they're
 
01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:25.980 align:start position:0%
all very different depending on what
 
01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
resources a County mental health
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
facility has and they may be more
 
01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
diversion type program they may be that
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
more intensive supervision program but
 
01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
we are trying to sort of come up with
 
01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
best standards help all those mental
 
01:01:41.569 --> 01:01:41.579 align:start position:0%
health courts adjust some of their
 
01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:43.140 align:start position:0%
practices as long as they have the
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
resources to do that so we're that's
 
01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:49.140 align:start position:0%
that's sort of a new new approach and
 
01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
then finally I'd love to talk about one
 
01:01:54.049 --> 01:01:54.059 align:start position:0%
idea that we had in Circuit Court was a
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
family treatment court it's it's another
 
01:01:58.250 --> 01:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
similar model people who are losing
 
01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
their kids because of substance use
 
01:02:03.049 --> 01:02:03.059 align:start position:0%
disorder it's a similar model where they
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
are responsive to the court they have um
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
dcyf sort of acts as the role of the
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
probation officer they have intensive
 
01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
treatment they have a lot of monitoring
 
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
they have um help reuniting with their
 
01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
children so that's a pilot project right
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
now and we hope that we can see how
 
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
their success pans out and maybe
 
01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
duplicate that across the state and
 
01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:26.940 align:start position:0%
finally one of the projects I'm really
 
01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:29.460 align:start position:0%
proud of and and is funded by the
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on Alcohol and
 
01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
Other Drugs is our community housing
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
program and we work in collaboration
 
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
with HHS and Doc which is really
 
01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:40.740 align:start position:0%
exciting to see that sort of approach
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
that across agencies and branches and
 
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
what that program does is it provides
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
Gap and Bridge housing for people who
 
01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
are in drug court or people who are
 
01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:52.740 align:start position:0%
coming out of the prison and we all know
 
01:02:54.109 --> 01:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
that people who don't have housing
 
01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:56.220 align:start position:0%
they're more likely to reoffend relapse
 
01:02:57.530 --> 01:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
even if they're getting treatment when
 
01:02:58.970 --> 01:02:58.980 align:start position:0%
they have housing they have stability
 
01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:01.380 align:start position:0%
they're able to continue with their with
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
their work and their program so the
 
01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
community housing program has been in
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
operation for a couple of years I think
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
we've served over 600 people housed
 
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
maybe 400 people and the important thing
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
to know is it's Bridge housing we're not
 
01:03:15.049 --> 01:03:15.059 align:start position:0%
just paying for people to have permanent
 
01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
housing it's emergency housing it's
 
01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
sober living and we have relationships
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
with some landlords that are actually
 
01:03:23.089 --> 01:03:23.099 align:start position:0%
now understanding how treatment courts
 
01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
work and have a voice in the community
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
and so we give somebody maybe a three
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
month of three months of housing until
 
01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
they can get their feet on the ground
 
01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
until they can get a job until they can
 
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
start paying for themselves and it's
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
really helped people maintain and find
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
housing on their own it's become a
 
01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
national model actually the National
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
Association of drug court professionals
 
01:03:44.329 --> 01:03:44.339 align:start position:0%
asked us to give a presentation on it
 
01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
last year at their conference which we
 
01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
did the governor is incredibly
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
supportive and he was really happy to
 
01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:51.900 align:start position:0%
hear the presentation at a meeting that
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
we had last year so that's it for the
 
01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
treatment Court piece I'm happy to
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
answer questions I also should let you
 
01:04:00.289 --> 01:04:00.299 align:start position:0%
know that anytime this division or all
 
01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
of Finance wants to hear more about
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
treatment courts I do have more sort of
 
01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
comprehensive presentations also
 
01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
everyone has an open invitation to go to
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
any drug court session in the state
 
01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
they're usually Mondays or Tuesdays but
 
01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
you can reach out to me and and find out
 
01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
when they when they are in your counties
 
01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McGuire
 
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
followed by representative Weiler
 
01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm unfamiliar with this area
 
01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
you said mental health court
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
I'm unaware that mental health is a
 
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
crime right it's not a crime but what
 
01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
happens is people with mental health
 
01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
issues commit crimes and and
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you know back in the back
 
01:04:42.289 --> 01:04:42.299 align:start position:0%
in the 50s with that well-intended idea
 
01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
to de-institutionalize Mental Health
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
Services and and have them be provided
 
01:04:49.849 --> 01:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
through the community those Community
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Services were not fully
 
01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
funded so the jails started becoming the
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
mental health facilities and we the
 
01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
jails are not equipped to do that so
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is identify
 
01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
people that are constantly either
 
01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
committing Criminal Trespass or their
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
their um some committing small minor
 
01:05:11.569 --> 01:05:11.579 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor thefts or shoplifting and
 
01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
it's related to their mental health we
 
01:05:15.289 --> 01:05:15.299 align:start position:0%
want to give them an option to stay out
 
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
of the jails to stop recycling through
 
01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:19.859 align:start position:0%
the jails and work with a treatment
 
01:05:23.089 --> 01:05:23.099 align:start position:0%
provider sometimes it's as simple as the
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
person who's committed the crime doesn't
 
01:05:26.569 --> 01:05:26.579 align:start position:0%
realize they are eligible for Medicaid
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
and it's just that connection with the
 
01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
men the Community Mental Health provider
 
01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
that gets them out of the system so so
 
01:05:35.329 --> 01:05:35.339 align:start position:0%
that's why we have these but you're
 
01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
right I don't want to build it so they
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
will come come that is the last thing I
 
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
want to do so so
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
the the money spent on treatment and
 
01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
housing Etc that's not from the
 
01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
Judiciary budget right that's from HHS
 
01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
or wherever right when we're talking
 
01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:55.140 align:start position:0%
about the mental health kind of docket
 
01:05:56.569 --> 01:05:56.579 align:start position:0%
if somebody's got mental health issues
 
01:05:58.609 --> 01:05:58.619 align:start position:0%
they are getting Services through their
 
01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health provider and
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
they're either paid for by Medicaid or
 
01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
bdas is providing
 
01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
um that it's not judicial branch the
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
drug courts we are sort of the
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
repository for the funding and then we
 
01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
contract with a treatment provider who
 
01:06:15.289 --> 01:06:15.299 align:start position:0%
provides treatment services for people
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
who are in drug court and we it's not
 
01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:19.140 align:start position:0%
part of this presentation because it's
 
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
not part of our way to caseload study
 
01:06:23.089 --> 01:06:23.099 align:start position:0%
but we will probably ask for an increase
 
01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
in funding for the treatment courts
 
01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
because we haven't seen one since 2016
 
01:06:29.930 --> 01:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
and and we're kind of losing providers
 
01:06:32.569 --> 01:06:32.579 align:start position:0%
because they aren't able to maintain a
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
living based on what we can pay them but
 
01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
that's a that's for our major budget
 
01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:38.450 align:start position:0%
that's a that's for our major budget
presentation

01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you chief
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
justice NATO I was very impressed with
 
01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
drug court when you came to Rockingham
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
County and asked us to demonstrate and
 
01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.589 align:start position:0%
County and asked us to demonstrate and
then

01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
you should all try to go to a Drug Court
 
01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.490 align:start position:0%
you should all try to go to a Drug Court
graduation

01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
graduation
 
01:06:58.010 --> 01:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
very impressive uh you listen to the
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
history of these people they've always
 
01:07:01.490 --> 01:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
been on the underclass they've always
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
been on the bottom and then they come to
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
graduation the prosecutor gets up and
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
talks about their how wonderful they did
 
01:07:12.589 --> 01:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
the the counselor the the uh the manager
 
01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
and of course the judge gets up and says
 
01:07:17.809 --> 01:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
what a good person they were had become
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
and and as I left it I thought about
 
01:07:22.849 --> 01:07:22.859 align:start position:0%
some of these people
 
01:07:24.770 --> 01:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this might have been the
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
first time in their lives that someone
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
gave them compliments from an official
 
01:07:32.329 --> 01:07:32.339 align:start position:0%
standpoint and I thought this positive
 
01:07:35.809 --> 01:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
reinforcement great idea and you know I
 
01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
think probably that's why we were so
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
impressed with it in Rockingham County
 
01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
and it went on to the rest of the state
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
so thank you for creating that well
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for keeping it going
 
01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
very well said representative Weiler
 
01:07:49.609 --> 01:07:49.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:54.289 --> 01:07:54.299 align:start position:0%
any further questions on this little yes
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
go ahead this is all very exciting and
 
01:07:58.849 --> 01:07:58.859 align:start position:0%
I'm so pleased to hear about all the
 
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
success could you explain the interplay
 
01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
between the mental health treatment
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
court and the drug court because I would
 
01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
expect there are people that yes use
 
01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
drugs that have mental health yes the
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
people in our drug courts 80 percent of
 
01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:13.980 align:start position:0%
them have co-occurring disorders so they
 
01:08:16.809 --> 01:08:16.819 align:start position:0%
may have anxiety depression even bipolar
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
all untreated PTSD many of them have
 
01:08:22.490 --> 01:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
trauma so there is an overlap and what
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
we try to do is we try to look at what
 
01:08:27.289 --> 01:08:27.299 align:start position:0%
is the what is the major glaring
 
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
component sometimes someone starts off
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
in mental health court and we realize
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
they actually need drug court because
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
um the it's the drugs that are creating
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
this problem for them and vice versa so
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
there's definitely overlap and there are
 
01:08:42.289 --> 01:08:42.299 align:start position:0%
risk assessment tools that we use to
 
01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
assess each person before they enter
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
into a program that gives us a better
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
idea it's an objective evidence-based
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
study tool that tells us what's their
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
score in terms of mental health issues
 
01:08:55.849 --> 01:08:55.859 align:start position:0%
drug drug abuse issues and criminal
 
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
thinking and that helps us Target where
 
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
and the judges at these courts are
 
01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
superior court judges in drug court
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
they're all superior court because it's
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
a felony drug court program and the idea
 
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
is to Target that high-risk high-ended
 
01:09:15.769 --> 01:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
person that we see headed to State
 
01:09:17.930 --> 01:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
Prison as their next step the mental
 
01:09:20.329 --> 01:09:20.339 align:start position:0%
health courts sometimes they are
 
01:09:21.769 --> 01:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
diversion programs and they don't
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to see a judge that's
 
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
another piece we're trying to figure out
 
01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
that the Circuit Court does not have the
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
resources to have a judge be meeting
 
01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
with people every week and so we need to
 
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
figure out whether or not how we want
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
that model to look but diversion is is a
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
possible model that works for mental
 
01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
health support
 
01:09:42.289 --> 01:09:42.299 align:start position:0%
and that's the same with the family the
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
family and we have only one family
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
treatment Court that's in circuit court
 
01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
because it's it's parents who have been
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
found abusive or neglectful of their
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
children and we want to reunite them by
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
making sure their substance use is
 
01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:57.709 align:start position:0%
making sure their substance use is
addressed

01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
all right thanks so much I just uh
 
01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
continue on on page 47 want to pick up
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
on the theme of mental illness uh New
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not immune to uh just as
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
NATO alluded to this is not immune to
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
the phenomenon that people end up in our
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
courts solely for the reasons that they
 
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
have under treated or untreated mental
 
01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:20.750 align:start position:0%
have under treated or untreated mental
illness

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
illness
 
01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
and they cycle through our system
 
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
they are repeat offenders
 
01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
and that the consequences of that or
 
01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
they end up in a county jail or state
 
01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
prison which is not clinically
 
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate for dealing with mental
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
illness I mean they do the best they can
 
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
but it is extremely expensive place and
 
01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
and we need to get these people the care
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
they need before they enter our system
 
01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:51.900 align:start position:0%
uh this has been the subject of a major
 
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
uh initiative by something called the
 
01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
conference of Chief justices which is
 
01:10:58.370 --> 01:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
comprised of all the chief justice state
 
01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
chief justices around the country
 
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
and came up with a task force report
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
after three years
 
01:11:09.130 --> 01:11:09.140 align:start position:0%
um in July and our
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
Judiciary is committed to doing our part
 
01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
in trying to address this problem
 
01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
to identify opportunities for our people
 
01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
to avoid the justice system to get the
 
01:11:25.970 --> 01:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
services they need so they do not enter
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
into our system and thereby enhancing
 
01:11:31.209 --> 01:11:31.219 align:start position:0%
Public Safety
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
providing critical services for the
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
people who need it and also saving the
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money
 
01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:42.780 align:start position:0%
and so Diane Martin the AOC director is
 
01:11:46.850 --> 01:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
really leading our effort and maybe just
 
01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about sequential
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
intercept mapping sure so um as the
 
01:11:55.729 --> 01:11:55.739 align:start position:0%
Chiefs both of the Chiefs uh have said
 
01:11:58.250 --> 01:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
mental illness is obviously
 
01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
um something that is seen in the courts
 
01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis and so a national
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
judicial task force looked at this issue
 
01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
and came out with a number of
 
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations in October of 2022 one
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
of the recommendations
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me was that
 
01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
um court-led initiatives in States tend
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
to be more successful in bringing Focus
 
01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
to issues and so they recommended that
 
01:12:25.729 --> 01:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
the courts lead collaborative efforts
 
01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
within their states to help address
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
these issues and one of the
 
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations that they had was that
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
sequential intercept mapping which is
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
really getting together with the
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
stakeholders throughout the state
 
01:12:43.570 --> 01:12:43.580 align:start position:0%
looking at what resources are available
 
01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
looking at what best practices are
 
01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
already being done and identifying gaps
 
01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:51.620 align:start position:0%
and then using all of that information
 
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
across the state to improve how we serve
 
01:12:57.649 --> 01:12:57.659 align:start position:0%
those experiencing mental illness and so
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
we at the court are are leading that
 
01:13:02.990 --> 01:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
initiative we applied for a grant from
 
01:13:05.229 --> 01:13:05.239 align:start position:0%
the state Justice Institute and got some
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
Grant funds to move forward we're
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
conducting a survey internally to see
 
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
how we can improve our responses to
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
people coming into the court and this is
 
01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
beyond just
 
01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:16.610 align:start position:0%
beyond just
um

01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
in in the courtrooms but our court staff
 
01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
and our judges and how we can do better
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
there and we are also moving forward
 
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
with sequential intercept mapping across
 
01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
the state the first of those will be
 
01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
with Merrimack County they actually had
 
01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
a small group of judges and stakeholders
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
already convening who are really
 
01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
interested in doing better in this area
 
01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
and so they volunteered to be the first
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
group so that sequential intercept
 
01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.010 align:start position:0%
group so that sequential intercept
mapping

01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
mapping
 
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
is planned for April of this year it's a
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
two-day event where your county folks
 
01:13:54.410 --> 01:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
will come together with your court
 
01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
people your mental health centers all of
 
01:14:00.649 --> 01:14:00.659 align:start position:0%
the individuals who touch on people who
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
are experiencing mental illness and
 
01:14:04.610 --> 01:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
really work to identify what resources
 
01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
we have to address that and what we
 
01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
don't and try to come up with a plan to
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
do better so we're really excited about
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
that after we get through the first one
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
the plan is to do that Statewide
 
01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:17.209 align:start position:0%
the plan is to do that Statewide
um

01:14:17.209 --> 01:14:17.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you the next uh area I want to
 
01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
talk about is uh let me identify the
 
01:14:29.149 --> 01:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
issue first and then talk about how
 
01:14:31.010 --> 01:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
we're addressing it
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
um any day in one of uh the circuit
 
01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
court houses
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
um 90 or more of the litigants appear
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
without an attorney
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
and they're in as you heard the types of
 
01:14:49.970 --> 01:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
cases that are in Circuit Court are very
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
immediate and very directly affect the
 
01:14:55.850 --> 01:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
lives of the people involved
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
so they are there on a perhaps an
 
01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
eviction action a landlord tenant action
 
01:15:05.649 --> 01:15:05.659 align:start position:0%
small claims uh divorce and parenting
 
01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
domestic violence all of these really
 
01:15:12.050 --> 01:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
immediate potentially life-changing
 
01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:15.140 align:start position:0%
issues without an attorney
 
01:15:18.910 --> 01:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
it's a very big and very complex problem
 
01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
but it's very important to us that we do
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
the best we can as a Judiciary to try
 
01:15:29.090 --> 01:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
and alleviate the consequences of what
 
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
we call the access to Justice gap which
 
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
is the the problem caused by up to 90 or
 
01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
more of litigants not having an attorney
 
01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
um so on page
 
01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
52 last year the legislature enacted a
 
01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
an important bill that I was pleased to
 
01:15:54.169 --> 01:15:54.179 align:start position:0%
support which is to have a a pilot
 
01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
program which authorizes
 
01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:00.900 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals to appear on behalf of
 
01:16:03.229 --> 01:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
clients in three of our circuit courts
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's an experiment really and the
 
01:16:09.290 --> 01:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
three circuit courts of Berlin uh
 
01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Franklin uh so that's
 
01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
ongoing and it was an important
 
01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
initiative this legislature and we're
 
01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
going to take the data and the results
 
01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
of that and report it back and see if
 
01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's an idea that should be
 
01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh next I want to invite judge king up
 
01:16:32.090 --> 01:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
here and talk about some of our efforts
 
01:16:35.330 --> 01:16:35.340 align:start position:0%
in in landlord tenant
 
01:16:37.490 --> 01:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
so landlord tenant is a is a pretty big
 
01:16:39.530 --> 01:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
part of what we do we had sort of a
 
01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
Hiatus during covid because the there
 
01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
were a number of
 
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
um sort of holds put on landlord tenants
 
01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
through the by the federal government
 
01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
through that process but we're back up
 
01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:53.219 align:start position:0%
and running now and mediation has been
 
01:16:55.970 --> 01:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
very successful in those cases where
 
01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
landlords and tenants are able to get
 
01:17:00.169 --> 01:17:00.179 align:start position:0%
together and there's a as you all well
 
01:17:03.649 --> 01:17:03.659 align:start position:0%
know a very uh big shortage of housing
 
01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and so when someone's
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough to be
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
in a housing situation
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
um getting evicted means that they may
 
01:17:15.649 --> 01:17:15.659 align:start position:0%
be without a place to live so and the
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
landlords don't necessarily like
 
01:17:18.770 --> 01:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
turnover either because it's expensive
 
01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
for them they have to clean the
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
apartment find somebody else and go
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
through the whole process so uh the
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
mediation has actually been very
 
01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:26.820 align:start position:0%
successful and now we have started we
 
01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
were actually one of the first states in
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
the country to start
 
01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
um eviction diversion which is a process
 
01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
that before the landlord decides to
 
01:17:38.689 --> 01:17:38.699 align:start position:0%
evict someone we offer mediation uh to
 
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
try to avoid that eviction action from
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
ever being filed and it can be working
 
01:17:45.490 --> 01:17:45.500 align:start position:0%
out a payment plan to get them caught up
 
01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
whatever the issue might be and we've
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
received Federal funding to continue
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
that program through a grant and we
 
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
think we may reach as many as 1100
 
01:17:59.810 --> 01:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant disputes pre-filing uh
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
in a year to hopefully allow the people
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
to stay in their housing and figure out
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
how the landlord can continue to get
 
01:18:08.209 --> 01:18:08.219 align:start position:0%
paid so it's a it's kind of a New
 
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
Concept the statute allows us to do
 
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
mediation in cases where there isn't a
 
01:18:15.890 --> 01:18:15.900 align:start position:0%
case yet and we're really optimistic
 
01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
that that's going to be a benefit to
 
01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
both landlords and tenants
 
01:18:22.729 --> 01:18:22.739 align:start position:0%
just another example of our efforts in
 
01:18:25.370 --> 01:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
this area page 55 or state law library
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
as part of the judicial branch and and
 
01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges that our
 
01:18:31.729 --> 01:18:31.739 align:start position:0%
self-represented litigants face is just
 
01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
access to basic legal materials the
 
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
stuff that lawyers use in preparing
 
01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
cases and arguing before judges and so
 
01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
our law library has been working with
 
01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
our public libraries around the state to
 
01:18:46.490 --> 01:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
provide access to something called
 
01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
Westlaw Westlaw is one of the two major
 
01:18:53.450 --> 01:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
legal databases and so if you go to a uh
 
01:18:55.729 --> 01:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
our public libraries in Dairy Portsmouth
 
01:18:58.729 --> 01:18:58.739 align:start position:0%
and Littleton you have free access to to
 
01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
Westlaw and that's been an important
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
resource for a self-represented
 
01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
litigants and just recently uh the clip
 
01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
you have on page 55 is
 
01:19:10.729 --> 01:19:10.739 align:start position:0%
actually Monday's paper where we
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
announced that we're making Westlaw
 
01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
available to people in their homes if
 
01:19:16.930 --> 01:19:16.940 align:start position:0%
you sign up
 
01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
or wherever they are they don't have to
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
go to the public library and that's
 
01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
another resource that we're making
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
available to self-representative
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
litigants and of course they can come
 
01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
into our state law library and access
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
our resources there
 
01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:33.060 align:start position:0%
then finally this is really important to
 
01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
me since I became Chief just to say I I
 
01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
really believe strongly that as the
 
01:19:41.090 --> 01:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
judicial branch we're sort of isolated
 
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
and it's it's a function of what we do
 
01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:45.050 align:start position:0%
and it's it's a function of what we do
but

01:19:45.050 --> 01:19:45.060 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
we there are lots of opportunities for
 
01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
us to engage with our communities and
 
01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
and get out there and educate them on
 
01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
what we do and
 
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
what the rule of law is and how our
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
system works and we've got a really some
 
01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
very important programs with respect to
 
01:20:07.610 --> 01:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
Civics education and judges actually
 
01:20:09.229 --> 01:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
reaching out we have something called
 
01:20:13.370 --> 01:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
national uh judicial Outreach coming up
 
01:20:15.890 --> 01:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
in March and our judges along with
 
01:20:17.810 --> 01:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
attorneys are deploying across the state
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
to to meet with Community groups Mr
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%

uh thanks so much and
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%

01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
uh if they're not I've of course oh
 
01:21:26.570 --> 01:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
thank you having been involved with two
 
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
of these people in 2011 in court reform
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
and having known the chief justice for a
 
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
number of years and seeing him at the
 
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office
 
01:21:37.850 --> 01:21:37.860 align:start position:0%
I'd like to compliment them all because
 
01:21:40.330 --> 01:21:40.340 align:start position:0%
these are people although many of the
 
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
Departments we deal with it's all hey
 
01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
we're important just give us all the
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
money these people are are Partners in
 
01:21:48.530 --> 01:21:48.540 align:start position:0%
trying to make everything more efficient
 
01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
and better
 
01:21:51.770 --> 01:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
and I've always been impressed with all
 
01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
of them especially from some of the
 
01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
previous Chief justices that we had that
 
01:22:00.169 --> 01:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
hey don't tell me what to do you know um
 
01:22:03.169 --> 01:22:03.179 align:start position:0%
these people are willing Partners In
 
01:22:05.209 --> 01:22:05.219 align:start position:0%
keeping this budget down and I want to
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank them for that and also mention to
 
01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
this committee this is a new unique
 
01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:10.550 align:start position:0%
this committee this is a new unique
thing

01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
most of the other departments we see
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
will have come through the
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
administrative services with the
 
01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:16.490 align:start position:0%
administrative services with the
governor

01:22:16.490 --> 01:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
because this is a separate branch of
 
01:22:20.090 --> 01:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
government they don't go through that
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
process they just come to us for the
 
01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
budget so this is the only presentation
 
01:22:26.450 --> 01:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
they make dealing with the budget
 
01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:28.980 align:start position:0%
strictly to us they don't come through
 
01:22:31.970 --> 01:22:31.980 align:start position:0%
the filter of the executive department I
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
think it's important and maybe maybe
 
01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
it's a better relationship I don't know
 
01:22:38.330 --> 01:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
because I've always enjoyed working with
 
01:22:40.130 --> 01:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
these three people I think they're rock
 
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
stars are keeping this system growing
 
01:22:43.850 --> 01:22:43.860 align:start position:0%
great I want to thank you all for this
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
presentation and the work you do thank
 
01:22:47.810 --> 01:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
you so much Mr chairman that means a
 
01:22:50.209 --> 01:22:50.219 align:start position:0%
great deal to us thank you thanks
 
01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
representative Weiland and just to add
 
01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
to that I think this is my eighth term
 
01:22:57.649 --> 01:22:57.659 align:start position:0%
on division one and after hearing from
 
01:22:59.450 --> 01:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch I always feel like
 
01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
we're in really good hands in the state
 
01:23:04.729 --> 01:23:04.739 align:start position:0%
I I just have this confidence that and
 
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
maybe some is representative Wireless
 
01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
said at other departments we may be able
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
to feel quite that way but there's such
 
01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
a great history for what you've done in
 
01:23:15.649 --> 01:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
the service to the state and I just feel
 
01:23:18.050 --> 01:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
really good about it so representative
 
01:23:20.770 --> 01:23:20.780 align:start position:0%
McGuire probably has a question
 
01:23:24.350 --> 01:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
yes I do yeah so um you know to sort of
 
01:23:28.689 --> 01:23:28.699 align:start position:0%
follow up along those lines I'm this
 
01:23:33.169 --> 01:23:33.179 align:start position:0%
term I'm a prime sponsor of a bill to do
 
01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
some reform under on the asset
 
01:23:37.729 --> 01:23:37.739 align:start position:0%
forfeiture area with the idea of
 
01:23:40.910 --> 01:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
streamlining the process a bit are there
 
01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
other things
 
01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
um that are in the law that
 
01:23:48.430 --> 01:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
cause you
 
01:23:52.490 --> 01:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
frustration that that you know if only I
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
didn't have to fill out this form or if
 
01:23:57.649 --> 01:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
only I didn't have to you know do those
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
things so things that we could change
 
01:24:02.209 --> 01:24:02.219 align:start position:0%
well I mean there is a bill right now
 
01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
and I think it's in the Senate on the
 
01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice panel so I don't
 
01:24:08.689 --> 01:24:08.699 align:start position:0%
know if you've heard about that that it
 
01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
was a well-intended process that was set
 
01:24:14.330 --> 01:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
up as sort of tort reform and required
 
01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
all medical malpractice cases to go
 
01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
through this panel process first before
 
01:24:21.410 --> 01:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
they could come to court and we've we
 
01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
are working on either pausing it and
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
studying it more or eliminating it
 
01:24:27.890 --> 01:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
because it actually we've seen over time
 
01:24:30.530 --> 01:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
maybe we have an average of 75 medical
 
01:24:33.290 --> 01:24:33.300 align:start position:0%
malpractice cases filed per year and
 
01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
zero to two of them end up going to to
 
01:24:37.550 --> 01:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
panel because they can wave it if they
 
01:24:40.370 --> 01:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
want to so that's that would streamline
 
01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
it takes a one and a half full-time
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
employees to deal with the scheduling
 
01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
and the collecting of information and
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
getting the panels together and managing
 
01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
the discovery and all that so that's one
 
01:24:53.450 --> 01:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
small one may I ask so are you saying
 
01:24:56.930 --> 01:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
the panels should be used more that they
 
01:24:59.330 --> 01:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
should not be waived or eliminated oh
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
just the limit I see okay because it's
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
the parties that wave it so they
 
01:25:05.570 --> 01:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
obviously are not using it fully
 
01:25:07.729 --> 01:25:07.739 align:start position:0%
that's just one example big investment
 
01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
low yield yeah yeah okay not enough
 
01:25:11.930 --> 01:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
juice for the squeezed or something
 
01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:12.910 align:start position:0%
juice for the squeezed or something
yeah

01:25:12.910 --> 01:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:25:24.169 --> 01:25:24.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:24.179 --> 01:25:25.130 align:start position:0%
 
question

01:25:25.130 --> 01:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
um chairman Leachman about we we do
 
01:25:30.110 --> 01:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
there's a separate bill for the land use
 
01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
docket judge so we that that counts for
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
this one that we're talking about here
 
01:25:36.169 --> 01:25:36.179 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't account for any of the
 
01:25:38.330 --> 01:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
staff and that bill we will also ask for
 
01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
a monitor and a case processor if it
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
passes so we would still even if that
 
01:25:46.189 --> 01:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
passes asked for the four clerical staff
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
and one because that that's totally
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
separate from the land use docket
 
01:25:52.729 --> 01:25:52.739 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Lynn is
 
01:25:54.890 --> 01:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
working very hard on that so I'll make
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
sure I Circle back with you yeah thank
 
01:25:59.390 --> 01:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Hewitt
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
yeah I just
 
01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
um I just want to add a point that uh
 
01:26:05.470 --> 01:26:05.480 align:start position:0%
going back to the beginning of the
 
01:26:10.030 --> 01:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
presentation uh we heard a lot about the
 
01:26:13.129 --> 01:26:13.139 align:start position:0%
study that has been done in the net in
 
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
the Nationwide study that was done in
 
01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
the in the the fact that the New
 
01:26:21.169 --> 01:26:21.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire courts have used the process
 
01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
of studying these these items to make
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
sure that they had an accurate figure
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
when you we have all kinds of people
 
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
that come to us and they're all
 
01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
everybody comes here looking for money I
 
01:26:36.410 --> 01:26:36.420 align:start position:0%
mean there's no question about that but
 
01:26:40.370 --> 01:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
they have ideas about how how much they
 
01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
should have and why
 
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh but not many times do you do you get
 
01:26:46.669 --> 01:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
direct information as a result of other
 
01:26:53.450 --> 01:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
places having accomplished a study
 
01:26:56.090 --> 01:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
that's that's that fortifies the
 
01:26:57.709 --> 01:26:57.719 align:start position:0%
position that the people that are before
 
01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
us uh are asking for so I think we have
 
01:27:03.709 --> 01:27:03.719 align:start position:0%
to be cognizant of that when we when we
 
01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
deal with a budget such as the court
 
01:27:08.209 --> 01:27:08.219 align:start position:0%
system because as uh representative
 
01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
Wilder and the representative of the
 
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
policemen have said uh this is an
 
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
independent part of the state government
 
01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:16.610 align:start position:0%
independent part of the state government
and

01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:19.010 --> 01:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of the a lot of the stuff that we
 
01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
hear through many of the agencies that
 
01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
come before us is is not something that
 
01:27:27.890 --> 01:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
the the court system has any any not in
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
not only do they have anything to do
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
with it
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
um but they don't they don't they aren't
 
01:27:34.729 --> 01:27:34.739 align:start position:0%
allowed to get involved in it so I think
 
01:27:36.890 --> 01:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
we have to bear that in mind you know
 
01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
when they for example when they say they
 
01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
haven't got enough help
 
01:27:43.970 --> 01:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
if I if I was in the position I would
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
tell you that no they don't have enough
 
01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
help they didn't have enough help when I
 
01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
was there and they still haven't got
 
01:27:51.410 --> 01:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
enough help and the pro and the problem
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
is that people like us here in this room
 
01:27:58.490 --> 01:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
don't recognize uh that their problem is
 
01:27:59.870 --> 01:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
kind of different
 
01:28:02.930 --> 01:28:02.940 align:start position:0%
from a lot of the problems we hear even
 
01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
in the case of uh adding adding the
 
01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
adding money to salaries you know we
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
don't we don't realize that they're in
 
01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
the same boat as everybody else
 
01:28:15.649 --> 01:28:15.659 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
thanks for your comments are there any
 
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
further questions representative evil
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
um could you speak a little bit about
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
the effect of the retirement age
 
01:28:33.410 --> 01:28:33.420 align:start position:0%
requirement on keeping your
 
01:28:43.370 --> 01:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:50.209 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:28:50.209 --> 01:28:50.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
there may be differences of opinion I
 
01:28:54.110 --> 01:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
mean I
 
01:28:58.850 --> 01:28:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.860 --> 01:28:59.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:02.209 --> 01:29:02.219 align:start position:0%
we've got a very strong bench and
 
01:29:05.149 --> 01:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
attracting quality candidates to serve
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
in the Judiciary has not been a problem
 
01:29:10.490 --> 01:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
for us in my opinion
 
01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:11.570 align:start position:0%
for us in my opinion
um

01:29:11.570 --> 01:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:14.689 --> 01:29:14.699 align:start position:0%
I I will be completely transparent about
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
this I I think that turnover in any
 
01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:23.400 align:start position:0%
institution is a good idea and
 
01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:25.189 align:start position:0%
institution is a good idea and
um I

01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
you know I I certainly don't subscribe
 
01:29:31.250 --> 01:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
to the idea that one can't
 
01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
successfully serve beyond the age of 70
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
but I do think that having regular
 
01:29:38.050 --> 01:29:38.060 align:start position:0%
turnover particularly in an isolated
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
institution like the Judiciary is a good
 
01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
idea and and
 
01:29:45.669 --> 01:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
the age limit is sort of a
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
built-in term limit if you will that's
 
01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
my but that's solely my personal view
 
01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:59.330 --> 01:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
sure my my comment is actually kind of
 
01:30:01.850 --> 01:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
the reverse of that at least as
 
01:30:03.530 --> 01:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
much as I represent the circuit court
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
and it's trying to keep the judges from
 
01:30:08.330 --> 01:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
burning out I don't think most of the
 
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court judges are retiring when
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
they're able and I don't think if you
 
01:30:15.169 --> 01:30:15.179 align:start position:0%
change the Constitution I don't think
 
01:30:17.810 --> 01:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
you'd find many takers that could keep
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
doing it I mean I worry we've had a lot
 
01:30:20.990 --> 01:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
of great appointments as the chief said
 
01:30:23.149 --> 01:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
some of these judges are very young I'm
 
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
wondering if they're going to be able to
 
01:30:27.649 --> 01:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
keep up with the pace for the 25 years
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to take them to get to their
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
eligibility and I'm I say that in all
 
01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
sincerity it's
 
01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:35.940 align:start position:0%
uh It's a Grind and I worry about them
 
01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
burning out and having their own sort of
 
01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
mental health issues keeping up with the
 
01:30:42.050 --> 01:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
nature of the cases that we deal with
 
01:30:43.970 --> 01:30:43.980 align:start position:0%
the volume
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
um and so I I'm not sure it would make
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
much it certainly wouldn't make much of
 
01:30:49.550 --> 01:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
a difference for the judges that work in
 
01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:51.540 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court I don't think I agree
 
01:30:53.689 --> 01:30:53.699 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:59.390 --> 01:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:01.070 align:start position:0%
any other
questions

01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:01.080 align:start position:0%

just you you wanted to make a grand
 
03:09:13.550 --> 03:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
entrance and that was very dramatic I
 
03:09:16.910 --> 03:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
try to avoid those so uh welcome good
 
03:09:19.190 --> 03:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
afternoon everybody uh members of the
 
03:09:21.050 --> 03:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
committee and Mr chair
 
03:09:22.730 --> 03:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
um my name is Bob Scott I'm a
 
03:09:23.570 --> 03:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
03:09:25.250 --> 03:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services thank you for uh
 
03:09:27.050 --> 03:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
inviting us to uh
 
03:09:29.570 --> 03:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about what we do we're
 
03:09:31.429 --> 03:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
always happy to talk about our our
 
03:09:34.490 --> 03:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
mission and our different programs uh so
 
03:09:36.830 --> 03:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
first I'd like to to introduce some of
 
03:09:40.010 --> 03:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
my key staff here uh so I have uh to my
 
03:09:42.650 --> 03:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
right is probably one of the I'll brag a
 
03:09:45.290 --> 03:09:45.300 align:start position:0%
little bit probably one of the uh she's
 
03:09:47.510 --> 03:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
our chief operating officer and and I
 
03:09:50.450 --> 03:09:50.460 align:start position:0%
would argue one of the the certainly a
 
03:09:51.830 --> 03:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
jewel for the state as far as
 
03:09:54.170 --> 03:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
understanding the process for uh moving
 
03:09:56.150 --> 03:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
money and our agency does a lot of that
 
03:09:57.710 --> 03:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
so we're really happy to have Sue
 
03:09:59.690 --> 03:09:59.700 align:start position:0%
Carlson with us as our chief operating
 
03:10:02.630 --> 03:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
officer uh in the background I think
 
03:10:04.070 --> 03:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
he's still there yes is our assistant
 
03:10:06.469 --> 03:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner Mark Sanborn
 
03:10:08.690 --> 03:10:08.700 align:start position:0%
and then you'll hear individually from
 
03:10:10.910 --> 03:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
our three division directors so our as
 
03:10:12.650 --> 03:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
long as it works for the the committee
 
03:10:15.349 --> 03:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
and the chair uh I was going to talk a
 
03:10:17.570 --> 03:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
little bit about generically what we do
 
03:10:21.110 --> 03:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh on the grand scale and then have our
 
03:10:23.030 --> 03:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
division directors speak no more than 15
 
03:10:26.809 --> 03:10:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:30.710 --> 03:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh that uh is uh on their programs and
 
03:10:32.269 --> 03:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
certainly probably the most important
 
03:10:33.650 --> 03:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
thing is to make sure we can answer any
 
03:10:35.510 --> 03:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
questions you have and we want to leave
 
03:10:38.389 --> 03:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
time time for that so again as I alluded
 
03:10:39.950 --> 03:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
to so we have three division directors
 
03:10:42.830 --> 03:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh Rennie Pelletier is our Water
 
03:10:45.410 --> 03:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
Division director uh he'll be up in a in
 
03:10:48.110 --> 03:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit uh we'll start with our air
 
03:10:50.809 --> 03:10:50.819 align:start position:0%
Resources Division uh Craig Wright
 
03:10:54.110 --> 03:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh and then uh last but certainly not
 
03:10:56.510 --> 03:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
least is going to be uh Mike wimsat with
 
03:10:59.570 --> 03:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
our Waste Management division so
 
03:11:02.090 --> 03:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
um and again uh will Mr chair I don't
 
03:11:03.230 --> 03:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
know if you want to wait till questions
 
03:11:05.210 --> 03:11:05.220 align:start position:0%
at the end or just as they come up so
 
03:11:07.490 --> 03:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
just please please uh whatever your
 
03:11:09.650 --> 03:11:09.660 align:start position:0%
desire is let us know we're pretty
 
03:11:13.130 --> 03:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
unruly but we take questions as we move
 
03:11:15.230 --> 03:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
along make it easier to keep track that
 
03:11:18.469 --> 03:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
sounds fine certainly so our we are very
 
03:11:20.750 --> 03:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
fortunate in a lot of ways we have uh I
 
03:11:23.389 --> 03:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
think our mission statement is uh very
 
03:11:25.250 --> 03:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
helpful in US attracting and keeping
 
03:11:27.530 --> 03:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
people so protecting Public Health in
 
03:11:29.990 --> 03:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
the environment uh while keeping an eye
 
03:11:34.250 --> 03:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
on the economy is is certainly uh you
 
03:11:35.809 --> 03:11:35.819 align:start position:0%
know that makes life a little bit easier
 
03:11:37.309 --> 03:11:37.319 align:start position:0%
for us to attract people because I think
 
03:11:38.990 --> 03:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
that's one of the the best missions that
 
03:11:41.870 --> 03:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
we have compared to others but I I am
 
03:11:44.210 --> 03:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
biased uh if you go to slide three in
 
03:11:45.950 --> 03:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
the handouts um
 
03:11:48.170 --> 03:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
you'll see how our our department is
 
03:11:51.230 --> 03:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
laid out uh we have uh three divisions
 
03:11:53.090 --> 03:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
and then of course the uh the
 
03:11:55.190 --> 03:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office which uh is kind
 
03:11:57.050 --> 03:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
of a mini Division and within that we
 
03:11:59.330 --> 03:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
have some things that may not be obvious
 
03:12:01.370 --> 03:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
to people haven't dealt with us before
 
03:12:03.469 --> 03:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
we have things like the the state
 
03:12:05.809 --> 03:12:05.819 align:start position:0%
Geological Survey
 
03:12:10.370 --> 03:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
um are are within that uh function in a
 
03:12:13.309 --> 03:12:13.319 align:start position:0%
in a we do our internal planning but
 
03:12:14.389 --> 03:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
also we have our public information
 
03:12:17.030 --> 03:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
officer office is located there also and
 
03:12:19.730 --> 03:12:19.740 align:start position:0%
that's increasingly uh important
 
03:12:19.740 --> 03:12:20.510 align:start position:0%
that's increasingly uh important
um

03:12:20.510 --> 03:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:22.910 --> 03:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
within that uh again you'll hear
 
03:12:24.769 --> 03:12:24.779 align:start position:0%
individually from the the divisions on
 
03:12:27.110 --> 03:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
what they do uh roughly I think at the
 
03:12:30.170 --> 03:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
moment we have on the order of 486 ftes
 
03:12:33.469 --> 03:12:33.479 align:start position:0%
full-time employees 491 excuse me I've
 
03:12:34.969 --> 03:12:34.979 align:start position:0%
been corrected
 
03:12:37.429 --> 03:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
um our core functions as as many of you
 
03:12:40.130 --> 03:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
know uh in in some of our priorities at
 
03:12:44.389 --> 03:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
the moment are water quality uh
 
03:12:46.910 --> 03:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh Water Resource Management so whether
 
03:12:50.650 --> 03:12:50.660 align:start position:0%
that's storm water runoff or or or
 
03:12:54.050 --> 03:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
contamination issues uh you'll you'll
 
03:12:57.050 --> 03:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
hear about regulation of air pollution
 
03:12:59.929 --> 03:12:59.939 align:start position:0%
um and certainly land use uh in general
 
03:13:01.790 --> 03:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
materials management waste management
 
03:13:04.790 --> 03:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
issues are are really uh in how we deal
 
03:13:07.070 --> 03:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
with those including emergency response
 
03:13:10.130 --> 03:13:10.140 align:start position:0%
UH responsibilities that we have those
 
03:13:13.250 --> 03:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
are all very important we are unique uh
 
03:13:15.290 --> 03:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
talking at a high level we we own and
 
03:13:17.030 --> 03:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
operate you'll hear this probably from
 
03:13:19.490 --> 03:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
any a Wastewater Treatment Facility in
 
03:13:21.050 --> 03:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
Franklin I think we're unique in the
 
03:13:24.349 --> 03:13:24.359 align:start position:0%
country uh for that as an agency we have
 
03:13:29.090 --> 03:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
offices in um on the Seacoast as well
 
03:13:31.070 --> 03:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
um so we'll hear about some of those
 
03:13:32.510 --> 03:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
things that we that may not be as
 
03:13:34.910 --> 03:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
obvious to some some that are more based
 
03:13:38.870 --> 03:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
and conquered uh moving to slide five uh
 
03:13:41.809 --> 03:13:41.819 align:start position:0%
of late uh I'll tell you some of our
 
03:13:44.809 --> 03:13:44.819 align:start position:0%
priorities are our water infrastructure
 
03:13:46.550 --> 03:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
Wastewater infrastructure there's
 
03:13:49.910 --> 03:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
there's uh you'll see a mismatch of uh
 
03:13:53.150 --> 03:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
acronyms uh we're lucky to have
 
03:13:54.590 --> 03:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
different funding sources in the state
 
03:13:57.650 --> 03:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
I've been in the state 26 years now and
 
03:13:59.690 --> 03:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
usually we have problems but not a lot
 
03:14:01.370 --> 03:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
of money to address it and now we're
 
03:14:03.710 --> 03:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
actually have some resources to start to
 
03:14:05.510 --> 03:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
address some of these problems so one is
 
03:14:06.830 --> 03:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
the drinking water groundwater trust
 
03:14:10.670 --> 03:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
fund uh that's uh as the name applies uh
 
03:14:12.050 --> 03:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
we've been able to use that and we
 
03:14:13.969 --> 03:14:13.979 align:start position:0%
allocate I'm one of the Commissioners on
 
03:14:16.849 --> 03:14:16.859 align:start position:0%
the trust fund uh roughly 20 million
 
03:14:18.349 --> 03:14:18.359 align:start position:0%
dollars a year towards drinking water
 
03:14:21.590 --> 03:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
projects and Source water protection uh
 
03:14:23.330 --> 03:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
the the state revolving Loan Fund has
 
03:14:25.250 --> 03:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
been a long-standing program with with
 
03:14:29.269 --> 03:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
Federal Federal funding uh we have a
 
03:14:32.710 --> 03:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
state revolving uh Loan program for both
 
03:14:36.050 --> 03:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
drinking water and clean water for those
 
03:14:39.469 --> 03:14:39.479 align:start position:0%
those who aren't as uh immersed if you
 
03:14:41.389 --> 03:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
will in our our world when we say clean
 
03:14:45.230 --> 03:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
water uh in this context we're not
 
03:14:46.610 --> 03:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
talking drinking water we're talking
 
03:14:49.550 --> 03:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
Wastewater storm water things that we'd
 
03:14:51.769 --> 03:14:51.779 align:start position:0%
like to become clean so that's that's
 
03:14:54.590 --> 03:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
kind of not an obvious thing for for the
 
03:14:58.250 --> 03:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
lay public and then uh arpa we've done
 
03:15:01.070 --> 03:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
very well with arpa uh out of the state
 
03:15:02.870 --> 03:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
and government side of arpa we've been
 
03:15:05.269 --> 03:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
allocated 185 million dollars for
 
03:15:07.309 --> 03:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
drinking water projects Wastewater
 
03:15:11.990 --> 03:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
projects uh and uh dams uh thank you uh
 
03:15:14.750 --> 03:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
so that's unique and then while I'm
 
03:15:17.750 --> 03:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
talking about funding sources uh on top
 
03:15:19.790 --> 03:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
of that the infrastructure bill from
 
03:15:21.889 --> 03:15:21.899 align:start position:0%
from Congress uh is pumping over the
 
03:15:23.630 --> 03:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
next five years a lot of money into the
 
03:15:25.730 --> 03:15:25.740 align:start position:0%
srf program so that's opening up a lot
 
03:15:28.429 --> 03:15:28.439 align:start position:0%
of opportunities and then an unknown uh
 
03:15:30.650 --> 03:15:30.660 align:start position:0%
they'll expect there'll be some things
 
03:15:33.349 --> 03:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to do is the the inflation
 
03:15:36.290 --> 03:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
reduction act the IRA act uh I guess
 
03:15:37.730 --> 03:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
that's redundant
 
03:15:37.740 --> 03:15:38.410 align:start position:0%
that's redundant
um

03:15:38.410 --> 03:15:38.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:41.389 --> 03:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
we think there'll be funds available for
 
03:15:44.570 --> 03:15:44.580 align:start position:0%
the state agencies also uh but but as as
 
03:15:46.610 --> 03:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
yet we're still waiting for the federal
 
03:15:48.710 --> 03:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
government to decide what the programs
 
03:15:50.269 --> 03:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
look like what the eligibility looks
 
03:15:52.370 --> 03:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
like and how we apply so there's more
 
03:15:54.830 --> 03:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
coming we think uh it's less on
 
03:15:56.510 --> 03:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that we believe will
 
03:16:00.170 --> 03:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
focus a lot on resiliency uh perhaps in
 
03:16:03.530 --> 03:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
in flood zones uh and environmental
 
03:16:04.910 --> 03:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
justice is also something they're
 
03:16:07.250 --> 03:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
strongly focusing on
 
03:16:08.929 --> 03:16:08.939 align:start position:0%
um as as you're aware and you'll hear
 
03:16:11.150 --> 03:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
from Mike wimsat I'm sure we spent a lot
 
03:16:13.090 --> 03:16:13.100 align:start position:0%
of time with emerging contaminants and
 
03:16:15.050 --> 03:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
someday I'd like to have a discussion
 
03:16:16.490 --> 03:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
without using the four-letter word or
 
03:16:18.590 --> 03:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
the pfas but I don't think that time is
 
03:16:18.600 --> 03:16:19.790 align:start position:0%
the pfas but I don't think that time is
now

03:16:19.790 --> 03:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:16:22.130 --> 03:16:22.140 align:start position:0%
uh and then within that we we're
 
03:16:24.290 --> 03:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
spending a lot of time and effort to
 
03:16:27.410 --> 03:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
make sure our our internal processes but
 
03:16:30.469 --> 03:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
also our publicly facing processes for
 
03:16:32.330 --> 03:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
permitting and just environmental data
 
03:16:34.610 --> 03:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
are accessible to the public and you
 
03:16:35.809 --> 03:16:35.819 align:start position:0%
know we realize there's a lot of
 
03:16:37.190 --> 03:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
efficiencies to be gained there and
 
03:16:39.889 --> 03:16:39.899 align:start position:0%
we're working on that also so then uh
 
03:16:43.910 --> 03:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
moving to slide uh six uh on before we
 
03:16:46.670 --> 03:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
go to the air division uh we've given
 
03:16:48.290 --> 03:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
that you're the finance committee we
 
03:16:49.309 --> 03:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to at least give you some
 
03:16:51.650 --> 03:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
highlights of of the budget in fact I'm
 
03:16:52.910 --> 03:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
going to put Sue Carlson on this spot
 
03:16:54.950 --> 03:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
why don't you talk to the rest of these
 
03:16:57.469 --> 03:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
on the budget since you're you're a guru
 
03:17:00.170 --> 03:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
that's that's an official word I use
 
03:17:02.150 --> 03:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Bob
 
03:17:03.769 --> 03:17:03.779 align:start position:0%
um just for the record my name is Susan
 
03:17:04.910 --> 03:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
Carlson with the Department of
 
03:17:06.590 --> 03:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services
 
03:17:08.210 --> 03:17:08.220 align:start position:0%
um I just put together three short
 
03:17:10.490 --> 03:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
slides of where we stand
 
03:17:12.710 --> 03:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
um right now in our request on the
 
03:17:16.370 --> 03:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget for 24 to give you an
 
03:17:19.210 --> 03:17:19.220 align:start position:0%
idea of the size of our agency
 
03:17:21.830 --> 03:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
so that when the divisions talk about it
 
03:17:23.150 --> 03:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
you can understand what we're talking
 
03:17:25.429 --> 03:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
about right now our initial request
 
03:17:28.070 --> 03:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
before the governor is 271 million
 
03:17:30.830 --> 03:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
dollars for 24 and slightly larger
 
03:17:34.870 --> 03:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
amount for 25 we're looking at
 
03:17:39.010 --> 03:17:39.020 align:start position:0%
491 authorized full-time positions
 
03:17:42.849 --> 03:17:42.859 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of Permitting work
 
03:17:46.910 --> 03:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
we do over 21 000 permits a year we do a
 
03:17:50.210 --> 03:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
number of inspections we deal with over
 
03:17:54.050 --> 03:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
35 state laws and we do manage over 115
 
03:17:57.650 --> 03:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
federal grants and if you turn to slide
 
03:18:02.389 --> 03:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
seven what I did was give view a very
 
03:18:05.450 --> 03:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
high level overview of where our funding
 
03:18:07.610 --> 03:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
comes from over 68 percent of our
 
03:18:09.710 --> 03:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
funding comes from other sources which
 
03:18:14.210 --> 03:18:14.220 align:start position:0%
is permits fees and other funds our
 
03:18:16.190 --> 03:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation is only six
 
03:18:17.750 --> 03:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
percent of our operating budget
 
03:18:20.630 --> 03:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
currently and federal funds make up the
 
03:18:22.610 --> 03:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
balance of 70 million dollars which is
 
03:18:25.429 --> 03:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
approximately 26 percent how do we
 
03:18:27.769 --> 03:18:27.779 align:start position:0%
actually use that money
 
03:18:27.779 --> 03:18:28.490 align:start position:0%
actually use that money
um

03:18:28.490 --> 03:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:31.370 --> 03:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
our operating expenses are our small
 
03:18:31.380 --> 03:18:32.630 align:start position:0%
our operating expenses are our small
piece

03:18:32.630 --> 03:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
piece
 
03:18:35.750 --> 03:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
of only five percent our salary and
 
03:18:37.790 --> 03:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
benefit costs are actually only a
 
03:18:40.670 --> 03:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
quarter of our operating budget over 68
 
03:18:44.389 --> 03:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
of our entire budget we put out the door
 
03:18:47.690 --> 03:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
in terms of Grants loans reimbursements
 
03:18:50.870 --> 03:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
and contracts so you see the majority of
 
03:18:52.550 --> 03:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
our money does not stay within the
 
03:18:54.650 --> 03:18:54.660 align:start position:0%
department it goes out to the
 
03:18:58.309 --> 03:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities and other entities
 
03:18:58.319 --> 03:19:02.290 align:start position:0%
municipalities and other entities
Bob

03:19:02.290 --> 03:19:02.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:05.030 --> 03:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
sure okay
 
03:19:08.389 --> 03:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
um one last slide that I put together
 
03:19:11.630 --> 03:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
um is more informational because a lot
 
03:19:13.429 --> 03:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
of people ask us what the difference is
 
03:19:15.710 --> 03:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
between the srf programs and our grant
 
03:19:15.720 --> 03:19:17.330 align:start position:0%
between the srf programs and our grant
programs

03:19:17.330 --> 03:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
programs
 
03:19:19.370 --> 03:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
but the state revolving Loan program is
 
03:19:21.650 --> 03:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
primarily a loan program
 
03:19:24.530 --> 03:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
it is loans it is based on federal laws
 
03:19:27.349 --> 03:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
and regulations and the source of funds
 
03:19:29.450 --> 03:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
is either federal grants to us or loan
 
03:19:32.090 --> 03:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
repayments the timing of our assistance
 
03:19:34.429 --> 03:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
is up front which means if you apply for
 
03:19:37.010 --> 03:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
a loan you get the money and what is
 
03:19:39.170 --> 03:19:39.180 align:start position:0%
qualifying entities are waste water and
 
03:19:41.090 --> 03:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
drinking water treatment systems which
 
03:19:43.130 --> 03:19:43.140 align:start position:0%
could be municipalities or in case of
 
03:19:44.870 --> 03:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
drinking water systems small private
 
03:19:47.630 --> 03:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
Water Systems are in a budget for these
 
03:19:50.330 --> 03:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
loans run between 100 and 120 million
 
03:19:50.340 --> 03:19:51.410 align:start position:0%
loans run between 100 and 120 million
dollars

03:19:51.410 --> 03:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:19:53.929 --> 03:19:53.939 align:start position:0%
the drinky water groundwater trust fund
 
03:19:57.889 --> 03:19:57.899 align:start position:0%
is an example of some of the um
 
03:20:01.010 --> 03:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
the grants that we put out it is a
 
03:20:04.809 --> 03:20:04.819 align:start position:0%
combination of Grants and some loans
 
03:20:08.990 --> 03:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
primarily in the pfas area that is based
 
03:20:12.650 --> 03:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
on State Statute this particular fund is
 
03:20:15.769 --> 03:20:15.779 align:start position:0%
funded from a lawsuit again it's an
 
03:20:17.870 --> 03:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
upfront and it is only for drinking
 
03:20:19.730 --> 03:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
water systems
 
03:20:22.309 --> 03:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
and we run between 30 and 40 million
 
03:20:24.650 --> 03:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
03:20:26.870 --> 03:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
um the state 8 grant program is a
 
03:20:28.370 --> 03:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
general fund program
 
03:20:32.269 --> 03:20:32.279 align:start position:0%
it is run it is mandated by statutes it
 
03:20:34.010 --> 03:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
is what we call an after-the-fact
 
03:20:36.769 --> 03:20:36.779 align:start position:0%
assistance which means you come this
 
03:20:39.590 --> 03:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
communities come in for this grant after
 
03:20:41.090 --> 03:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
they have built their wastewater
 
03:20:43.550 --> 03:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
treatment system and after they've had a
 
03:20:45.710 --> 03:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
year of operation then they apply for
 
03:20:48.830 --> 03:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
this grant and we pay approximately 20
 
03:20:50.750 --> 03:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
percent of their annual Debt Service
 
03:20:53.410 --> 03:20:53.420 align:start position:0%
payment so when we make these grants
 
03:20:55.969 --> 03:20:55.979 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we are looking at a 20-year
 
03:20:59.030 --> 03:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
commitment right now our annual budget
 
03:21:01.370 --> 03:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
for this program runs between 13 and 16
 
03:21:04.730 --> 03:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:04.740 --> 03:21:07.849 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:21:07.849 --> 03:21:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:09.410 --> 03:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:21:12.889 --> 03:21:12.899 align:start position:0%
taking my question so on the dwdg
 
03:21:16.010 --> 03:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
lawsuit proceeds is that is that going
 
03:21:18.290 --> 03:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
to run out at some point or is it yeah
 
03:21:20.210 --> 03:21:20.220 align:start position:0%
the groundwater drinking water
 
03:21:22.309 --> 03:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund
 
03:21:25.490 --> 03:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
um right now has an estimated
 
03:21:25.500 --> 03:21:27.230 align:start position:0%
um right now has an estimated
around

03:21:27.230 --> 03:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
around
 
03:21:27.240 --> 03:21:32.510 align:start position:0%
around
2041.

03:21:32.510 --> 03:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:34.070 --> 03:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
and that's based on the current spend
 
03:21:36.769 --> 03:21:36.779 align:start position:0%
rate right the 30 to 40 million a year
 
03:21:38.690 --> 03:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
kind of thing right because some of it
 
03:21:40.370 --> 03:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
is loan some of it is Grants and the
 
03:21:42.469 --> 03:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
loans will get repaid which will run
 
03:21:45.769 --> 03:21:45.779 align:start position:0%
this out but as um we're actually doing
 
03:21:47.630 --> 03:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
a presentation before the advisory
 
03:21:50.630 --> 03:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
committee on the February 13th to give
 
03:21:53.269 --> 03:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
them a status update on the forecast and
 
03:21:55.010 --> 03:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
then the first two categories are there
 
03:21:57.490 --> 03:21:57.500 align:start position:0%
no General funds including
 
03:21:59.690 --> 03:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
salaries of the people who administer
 
03:22:02.330 --> 03:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
these programs for the srf program and
 
03:22:04.969 --> 03:22:04.979 align:start position:0%
the trust yes for the trust no there are
 
03:22:07.370 --> 03:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
no General funds although
 
03:22:10.550 --> 03:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
in the pfas program we were given a
 
03:22:12.950 --> 03:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
separate 25 million dollar appropriation
 
03:22:16.190 --> 03:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
just for Grants not for some the srf
 
03:22:16.200 --> 03:22:18.830 align:start position:0%
just for Grants not for some the srf
program

03:22:18.830 --> 03:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:22.250 --> 03:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
in the Clean Water side we have a four
 
03:22:25.429 --> 03:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
percent match which is State funds
 
03:22:28.550 --> 03:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
and on the drinking water side excuse me
 
03:22:32.090 --> 03:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
let me back up on the srf programs it is
 
03:22:35.389 --> 03:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
an 80 20 grant program we have 80
 
03:22:39.590 --> 03:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
percent federal funds 20 State funds we
 
03:22:41.450 --> 03:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
actually provide the match for the base
 
03:22:44.809 --> 03:22:44.819 align:start position:0%
Grant through the capital budget
 
03:22:46.790 --> 03:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
um but on the clean water side we are
 
03:22:49.130 --> 03:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
only allowed to use four percent for
 
03:22:51.769 --> 03:22:51.779 align:start position:0%
administrative cost on the clean water
 
03:22:51.779 --> 03:22:53.090 align:start position:0%
administrative cost on the clean water
side

03:22:53.090 --> 03:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
side
 
03:22:56.150 --> 03:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
um what they refer to as semicides is 69
 
03:22:59.269 --> 03:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
loans 31
 
03:23:00.530 --> 03:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
um for technical assistance
 
03:23:00.540 --> 03:23:03.590 align:start position:0%
um for technical assistance
Administration

03:23:03.590 --> 03:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:06.050 --> 03:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
so there is some general fund in this
 
03:23:10.309 --> 03:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
but once we um and only on the Federal
 
03:23:12.590 --> 03:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
grant side of the house
 
03:23:14.269 --> 03:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
um on the repayment side of the house
 
03:23:16.490 --> 03:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
that is all
 
03:23:18.650 --> 03:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
um non-general fund money
 
03:23:21.469 --> 03:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:24.590 --> 03:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
representative evil thank you so in the
 
03:23:26.870 --> 03:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
drinking water groundwater trust fund
 
03:23:29.269 --> 03:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
that's um is that what are the sources
 
03:23:31.750 --> 03:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
of funds there is that MTB
 
03:23:36.110 --> 03:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
mtbe is a separate pool of money
 
03:23:38.750 --> 03:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
um this
 
03:23:42.710 --> 03:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
we received two pools of money from the
 
03:23:42.720 --> 03:23:43.849 align:start position:0%
we received two pools of money from the
lawsuit

03:23:43.849 --> 03:23:43.859 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
03:23:46.969 --> 03:23:46.979 align:start position:0%
one was the settlement money
 
03:23:49.010 --> 03:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
um which was approximately 81 million
 
03:23:51.729 --> 03:23:51.739 align:start position:0%
dollars which we refer to as the mtbe
 
03:23:54.889 --> 03:23:54.899 align:start position:0%
and that goes strictly for mtbe
 
03:23:54.899 --> 03:23:57.590 align:start position:0%
and that goes strictly for mtbe
remediation

03:23:57.590 --> 03:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
remediation
 
03:23:59.990 --> 03:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
um the lawsuit against Exxon is what
 
03:24:02.389 --> 03:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
created the trust
 
03:24:06.469 --> 03:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
and that money is what we use
 
03:24:08.389 --> 03:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
um for the drinking water trust grants
 
03:24:11.870 --> 03:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:15.769 --> 03:24:15.779 align:start position:0%
and and where is the 25 million for pfas
 
03:24:19.729 --> 03:24:19.739 align:start position:0%
that sits in its own pfas fund
 
03:24:22.010 --> 03:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
we have a number of
 
03:24:24.170 --> 03:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
different funds
 
03:24:26.210 --> 03:24:26.220 align:start position:0%
in different pots of money
 
03:24:28.370 --> 03:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
and I use the drinking one to
 
03:24:37.130 --> 03:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:39.469 --> 03:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so if there's no more
 
03:24:41.150 --> 03:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
budget related questions which we
 
03:24:42.889 --> 03:24:42.899 align:start position:0%
definitely want Sue she's not going far
 
03:24:46.010 --> 03:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
so uh I'll uh I'll bring up our director
 
03:24:48.410 --> 03:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
right to talk about the air division
 
03:24:50.809 --> 03:24:50.819 align:start position:0%
uh thank you commissioner
 
03:24:52.790 --> 03:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair members of the committee
 
03:24:54.530 --> 03:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be here
 
03:24:57.290 --> 03:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
uh the air division starts on page 10.
 
03:24:58.849 --> 03:24:58.859 align:start position:0%
um I'll just kick us off with two
 
03:25:00.170 --> 03:25:00.180 align:start position:0%
high-level thoughts about the air
 
03:25:00.180 --> 03:25:01.130 align:start position:0%
high-level thoughts about the air
division

03:25:01.130 --> 03:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
division
 
03:25:02.929 --> 03:25:02.939 align:start position:0%
the air division is responsible for
 
03:25:05.690 --> 03:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
implementing nine State statutes and we
 
03:25:07.729 --> 03:25:07.739 align:start position:0%
also implement the vast majority of
 
03:25:09.229 --> 03:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
federal Clean Air Act Amendments of
 
03:25:12.469 --> 03:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
1990. the other high level uh thought
 
03:25:14.929 --> 03:25:14.939 align:start position:0%
I'll leave you with is EPA under the ACT
 
03:25:16.910 --> 03:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
is responsible for setting what we call
 
03:25:18.650 --> 03:25:18.660 align:start position:0%
National ambient air quality standards
 
03:25:20.630 --> 03:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
which are health-based standards for six
 
03:25:22.309 --> 03:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
criteria pollutants and it's the
 
03:25:24.410 --> 03:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
division's responsibility to implement
 
03:25:26.389 --> 03:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
its program monitor air quality and to
 
03:25:27.950 --> 03:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
implement programs to make sure that we
 
03:25:31.190 --> 03:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
meet those health-based standards
 
03:25:34.490 --> 03:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
organizationally on slide 11 we have
 
03:25:36.530 --> 03:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
three Bros and a director's office I
 
03:25:38.030 --> 03:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
want to talk about each Bureau so I
 
03:25:40.849 --> 03:25:40.859 align:start position:0%
won't mention about them right here I'll
 
03:25:43.370 --> 03:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
just note that we have 65 staff highly
 
03:25:43.380 --> 03:25:44.870 align:start position:0%
just note that we have 65 staff highly
professional

03:25:44.870 --> 03:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
professional
 
03:25:47.389 --> 03:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
um highly technical staff working for
 
03:25:49.250 --> 03:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
the division the director's office is
 
03:25:50.750 --> 03:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
obviously responsible for management
 
03:25:53.450 --> 03:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
budgeting and also we do do some
 
03:25:55.370 --> 03:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
technical work in the division one thing
 
03:25:57.110 --> 03:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
we know and at the director's office
 
03:25:59.690 --> 03:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
level is that air pollution Knows No
 
03:26:01.490 --> 03:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
geopolitical Boundaries so we have to
 
03:26:03.110 --> 03:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
deal with the transport of air pollution
 
03:26:05.570 --> 03:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
and the director's office handles that
 
03:26:08.330 --> 03:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
permitting environmental health group is
 
03:26:10.610 --> 03:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
responsible for issuing federal and
 
03:26:12.590 --> 03:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
state air quality permits I like to
 
03:26:14.389 --> 03:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
mention the federal side because I think
 
03:26:15.650 --> 03:26:15.660 align:start position:0%
it's important to know if you need an
 
03:26:17.150 --> 03:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
app permit in New Hampshire you simply
 
03:26:19.250 --> 03:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
come to Des you don't go to have to go
 
03:26:22.070 --> 03:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
you don't have to go to EPA EPA does
 
03:26:23.809 --> 03:26:23.819 align:start position:0%
have a role in reviewing our area
 
03:26:26.090 --> 03:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
permits they comment and on a very small
 
03:26:28.309 --> 03:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
subset of permits they have the ability
 
03:26:30.050 --> 03:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
to veto a permit that but that's only
 
03:26:32.450 --> 03:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
for a small subset of our sources
 
03:26:34.309 --> 03:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the permit program is to
 
03:26:36.050 --> 03:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
ensure that sources can comply with both
 
03:26:38.269 --> 03:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
state and federal air regulations the
 
03:26:40.550 --> 03:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
division has 40 something sets of
 
03:26:42.590 --> 03:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and we've adopted
 
03:26:45.469 --> 03:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
hundreds of federal standards for this
 
03:26:48.530 --> 03:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
ease of sources being able to again have
 
03:26:50.269 --> 03:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
a single permit that covers everything
 
03:26:51.830 --> 03:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
they need to do on the state and federal
 
03:26:51.840 --> 03:26:52.849 align:start position:0%
they need to do on the state and federal
level

03:26:52.849 --> 03:26:52.859 align:start position:0%
level
 
03:26:55.190 --> 03:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
we also have a state air toxics program
 
03:26:57.530 --> 03:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
where we set health-based standards for
 
03:27:00.710 --> 03:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
over 600 stadia toxics there's also a
 
03:27:02.570 --> 03:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
federal air toxics program known as
 
03:27:04.309 --> 03:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
hazardous air pollutants we also
 
03:27:06.349 --> 03:27:06.359 align:start position:0%
Implement that that is not a
 
03:27:07.790 --> 03:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
health-based program that is a
 
03:27:10.010 --> 03:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
technology-based program our
 
03:27:12.170 --> 03:27:12.180 align:start position:0%
Environmental Health Group helps not
 
03:27:13.910 --> 03:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
only the air division but also the waste
 
03:27:15.550 --> 03:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
Division and the Water Division
 
03:27:17.630 --> 03:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
evaluating Health impacts from
 
03:27:19.910 --> 03:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
environmental contaminants and also risk
 
03:27:24.710 --> 03:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:27.290 --> 03:27:27.300 align:start position:0%
on the next slide slide 13 is just some
 
03:27:29.630 --> 03:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
stats from the air permit program we
 
03:27:31.729 --> 03:27:31.739 align:start position:0%
have 805 permanent sources in New
 
03:27:34.010 --> 03:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I won't run through the list
 
03:27:35.330 --> 03:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
you can see the different types of
 
03:27:37.729 --> 03:27:37.739 align:start position:0%
permits we issue I will just indicate of
 
03:27:40.729 --> 03:27:40.739 align:start position:0%
those 805 sources over 500 of them are
 
03:27:42.849 --> 03:27:42.859 align:start position:0%
able to handle their permitting online
 
03:27:45.290 --> 03:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
we'd like to get to a hundred percent of
 
03:27:46.670 --> 03:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
all of our sources online and we're
 
03:27:48.290 --> 03:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
slowly working towards that
 
03:27:49.910 --> 03:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
Below on that table is just some
 
03:27:51.889 --> 03:27:51.899 align:start position:0%
permanent statistics for FY their
 
03:27:54.530 --> 03:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
calendar calendar year 2022 and I think
 
03:27:56.090 --> 03:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
you can see as we get permanent
 
03:27:57.830 --> 03:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
applications in we get permits out the
 
03:27:59.750 --> 03:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
door of course following a public
 
03:28:02.570 --> 03:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
process including an opportunity for
 
03:28:05.210 --> 03:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
public hearing on all of our permits so
 
03:28:07.130 --> 03:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
I have a quick question since I see the
 
03:28:09.710 --> 03:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
bow coal plant in one of your slides
 
03:28:11.389 --> 03:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
sure is here
 
03:28:13.309 --> 03:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
so as you know New Hampshire another New
 
03:28:15.469 --> 03:28:15.479 align:start position:0%
England states have an issue with power
 
03:28:18.229 --> 03:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
supply I've noticed a bold plant's been
 
03:28:19.790 --> 03:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
quite active over the last couple of
 
03:28:22.070 --> 03:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
weeks are they under any sort of
 
03:28:24.889 --> 03:28:24.899 align:start position:0%
restrictions as far as time frame that
 
03:28:27.229 --> 03:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
they can continue to run or
 
03:28:29.330 --> 03:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
what do they still have a permit that
 
03:28:31.250 --> 03:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
will say go out 10 years or five years
 
03:28:33.590 --> 03:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
so they are what we call a Title Five
 
03:28:35.870 --> 03:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
Source they're a major federal Source uh
 
03:28:37.670 --> 03:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
their permit is an operating permit that
 
03:28:39.590 --> 03:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
lasts for five years and they have to
 
03:28:41.510 --> 03:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
renew it on a five-year cycle
 
03:28:43.729 --> 03:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
do you know what that cycle is is it are
 
03:28:46.610 --> 03:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
they in the I believe they're in their
 
03:28:48.410 --> 03:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
first or second year of their latest
 
03:28:51.769 --> 03:28:51.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:53.750 --> 03:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
okay questions
 
03:28:56.330 --> 03:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
no thanks uh next is our compliance
 
03:28:58.309 --> 03:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
Bureau this is really a boots on the
 
03:29:00.229 --> 03:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
ground uh program these are the folks
 
03:29:02.389 --> 03:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
out in the field doing stack testing and
 
03:29:04.370 --> 03:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
compliance inspection the picture you
 
03:29:06.170 --> 03:29:06.180 align:start position:0%
see here is actually one of my guys up
 
03:29:08.269 --> 03:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
on a stack where we're doing emissions
 
03:29:10.429 --> 03:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
testing on that particular Source we
 
03:29:13.429 --> 03:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
witnessed 40 to 50 emission tests per
 
03:29:16.070 --> 03:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
year those tests are done under EPA
 
03:29:18.349 --> 03:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
methods generally a third party comes in
 
03:29:21.050 --> 03:29:21.060 align:start position:0%
to do the testing but Des is on site to
 
03:29:22.670 --> 03:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
observe the testing to ensure that it's
 
03:29:24.170 --> 03:29:24.180 align:start position:0%
done correctly under the federal
 
03:29:26.690 --> 03:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
standards and state standards in
 
03:29:28.370 --> 03:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
addition we have 24 what we call
 
03:29:30.290 --> 03:29:30.300 align:start position:0%
continuous submission monitors out there
 
03:29:32.690 --> 03:29:32.700 align:start position:0%
we're on site to verify those devices
 
03:29:34.550 --> 03:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
are accurately collecting data and
 
03:29:36.830 --> 03:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
Reporting data so that we can monitor
 
03:29:40.190 --> 03:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
air pollution from those sources
 
03:29:41.929 --> 03:29:41.939 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned the compliance Bureau
 
03:29:43.790 --> 03:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
also does inspections we conduct
 
03:29:46.070 --> 03:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 60 and 80 inspections
 
03:29:48.229 --> 03:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
a year we negotiate an annual inspection
 
03:29:52.269 --> 03:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
plan with EPA EPA dictates that we
 
03:29:55.370 --> 03:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
inspect certain sources on a in a
 
03:29:56.990 --> 03:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
schedule that they set and we have to
 
03:29:58.370 --> 03:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
make sure we meet that schedule under
 
03:29:59.690 --> 03:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
our work plan
 
03:30:01.910 --> 03:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh we also respond to about 80 to 100
 
03:30:03.889 --> 03:30:03.899 align:start position:0%
complaints a year generally those are
 
03:30:06.110 --> 03:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
neighbor on neighbor type complaints or
 
03:30:07.429 --> 03:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
somebody living next to a factory
 
03:30:09.670 --> 03:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
worried about odors or visible emissions
 
03:30:11.809 --> 03:30:11.819 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing we do a lot of
 
03:30:14.630 --> 03:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
Investigation of is illegal burning I
 
03:30:16.070 --> 03:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
like the joke open burning in New
 
03:30:17.330 --> 03:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's kind of a beer drinking
 
03:30:19.490 --> 03:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
sport that people like to burn
 
03:30:21.530 --> 03:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
everything and anything we usually get
 
03:30:23.510 --> 03:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
mainly referrals from local fire
 
03:30:25.849 --> 03:30:25.859 align:start position:0%
departments when they find those types
 
03:30:27.190 --> 03:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
of situations
 
03:30:29.389 --> 03:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement's not our first tool from
 
03:30:31.250 --> 03:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
compliance standpoint but we do have to
 
03:30:34.010 --> 03:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
to use tools there under both this
 
03:30:36.229 --> 03:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
department has an enforcement policy and
 
03:30:38.389 --> 03:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
EPA also has certain employment policies
 
03:30:40.309 --> 03:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
our goal is to handle all those
 
03:30:42.530 --> 03:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
Enforcement cases in state not get EPA
 
03:30:44.090 --> 03:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
involved other than just from a review
 
03:30:46.130 --> 03:30:46.140 align:start position:0%
standpoint and a lot you can see the
 
03:30:47.690 --> 03:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
statistics last year we had 38
 
03:30:49.429 --> 03:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
Enforcement cases without Federal over
 
03:30:49.439 --> 03:30:50.450 align:start position:0%
Enforcement cases without Federal over
filing

03:30:50.450 --> 03:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
filing
 
03:30:53.690 --> 03:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
the compliance Bureau also on slide 16 I
 
03:30:55.969 --> 03:30:55.979 align:start position:0%
think has a asbestos management section
 
03:30:58.790 --> 03:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
this largely is construction demo
 
03:31:02.330 --> 03:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
Renault demolition renovation of pro of
 
03:31:04.849 --> 03:31:04.859 align:start position:0%
projects uh we receive over 1200
 
03:31:07.790 --> 03:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
notifications a year about asbestos
 
03:31:09.650 --> 03:31:09.660 align:start position:0%
removal jobs and we get out and inspect
 
03:31:12.830 --> 03:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
about 10 of those or 120 per year we
 
03:31:14.690 --> 03:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
also have a worker licensing program in
 
03:31:16.130 --> 03:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
this business program
 
03:31:19.090 --> 03:31:19.100 align:start position:0%
our Technical Services Bureau on page 17
 
03:31:21.650 --> 03:31:21.660 align:start position:0%
one of the main roles of that group is
 
03:31:23.870 --> 03:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
to monitor air quality and what you see
 
03:31:25.610 --> 03:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
here is a map of where we have our air
 
03:31:27.590 --> 03:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
quality monitoring stations we monitor
 
03:31:29.510 --> 03:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
from the top of Mount Washington
 
03:31:31.550 --> 03:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
down the Connecticut River Valley across
 
03:31:33.290 --> 03:31:33.300 align:start position:0%
the Southern Tier the Seacoast up the
 
03:31:35.450 --> 03:31:35.460 align:start position:0%
Merrimack River Valley and also around
 
03:31:38.750 --> 03:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
in Laconia around Lake Winnipesaukee
 
03:31:40.550 --> 03:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
we monitor for five different pollutants
 
03:31:42.290 --> 03:31:42.300 align:start position:0%
you can see there we don't monitor for
 
03:31:44.030 --> 03:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
every pollutant at every station some
 
03:31:45.950 --> 03:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
stations may only monitor for a single
 
03:31:48.349 --> 03:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
pollutant for a scientific reason or it
 
03:31:49.729 --> 03:31:49.739 align:start position:0%
may want it to for all those pollutants
 
03:31:52.070 --> 03:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
we work out an annual monitoring Network
 
03:31:55.550 --> 03:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
plan with EPA Technical Services Bureau
 
03:31:57.349 --> 03:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
also deals with mobile sources mobile
 
03:31:59.150 --> 03:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
sources continue to be the largest
 
03:32:01.690 --> 03:32:01.700 align:start position:0%
source of air pollution in New Hampshire
 
03:32:04.490 --> 03:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
we everybody's familiar with our onboard
 
03:32:06.530 --> 03:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
diagnostics program everybody's favorite
 
03:32:09.410 --> 03:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
check engine light program uh that is as
 
03:32:11.510 --> 03:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
at least partially an environmental
 
03:32:13.849 --> 03:32:13.859 align:start position:0%
program Department of Safety runs that
 
03:32:15.950 --> 03:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
program what we do is we analyze the
 
03:32:18.170 --> 03:32:18.180 align:start position:0%
data that they collect and then report
 
03:32:21.170 --> 03:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
that data to EPA we also handle some
 
03:32:23.630 --> 03:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
federal grants under the uh sorry we
 
03:32:25.010 --> 03:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
handle different grants we have the
 
03:32:26.750 --> 03:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
Volkswagen Grant which I'll talk about
 
03:32:28.130 --> 03:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
in a different slide but we also have
 
03:32:30.170 --> 03:32:30.180 align:start position:0%
Dara grants diesel emission reduction
 
03:32:30.180 --> 03:32:31.790 align:start position:0%
Dara grants diesel emission reduction
grants

03:32:31.790 --> 03:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
grants
 
03:32:33.170 --> 03:32:33.180 align:start position:0%
um these are this is a federal program
 
03:32:36.769 --> 03:32:36.779 align:start position:0%
we match that program with the VW funds
 
03:32:38.990 --> 03:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
to get bonus funds in that program this
 
03:32:41.210 --> 03:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
year we have about 1.2 million dollars
 
03:32:43.309 --> 03:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
in that program for to replace help
 
03:32:45.170 --> 03:32:45.180 align:start position:0%
replace diesel engines
 
03:32:46.729 --> 03:32:46.739 align:start position:0%
we also have a New Hampshire Clean
 
03:32:49.250 --> 03:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
Cities program it's a federal doe
 
03:32:51.889 --> 03:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
program we have 120 stakeholders the
 
03:32:54.530 --> 03:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
goal is to help facilities and fleets
 
03:32:56.630 --> 03:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
and companies to reduce Reliance on
 
03:33:00.290 --> 03:33:00.300 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel in the transportation sector
 
03:33:02.929 --> 03:33:02.939 align:start position:0%
page 19 uh the Volkswagen mitigation
 
03:33:05.570 --> 03:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
trust folks will probably remember back
 
03:33:07.190 --> 03:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
a couple years a number of years ago the
 
03:33:08.929 --> 03:33:08.939 align:start position:0%
Volkswagen emissions cheating scandal
 
03:33:10.670 --> 03:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
there was a national settlement on that
 
03:33:12.590 --> 03:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire received just under 31
 
03:33:15.410 --> 03:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
million dollars in October of 2017.
 
03:33:17.510 --> 03:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
those funds are held in a third party
 
03:33:21.110 --> 03:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
Trust Des became the lead Agency for
 
03:33:23.750 --> 03:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
that for processing applications under
 
03:33:26.450 --> 03:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
that trust fund in August of 2021
 
03:33:27.769 --> 03:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
you can there's a New Hampshire
 
03:33:29.630 --> 03:33:29.640 align:start position:0%
beneficiary mitigation plan that
 
03:33:31.429 --> 03:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
dictates how we will spend that money
 
03:33:33.889 --> 03:33:33.899 align:start position:0%
under the trust uh the things I'll point
 
03:33:37.190 --> 03:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
out we have about 15.5 million dollars
 
03:33:38.750 --> 03:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
for vehicle Replacements on the state
 
03:33:40.550 --> 03:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
level and Municipal level we've
 
03:33:42.710 --> 03:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
completed the state portion of that work
 
03:33:45.469 --> 03:33:45.479 align:start position:0%
today 6.2 million for competitive grants
 
03:33:48.170 --> 03:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
we haven't started that yet 4.6 million
 
03:33:49.969 --> 03:33:49.979 align:start position:0%
dollars for installing EV electric
 
03:33:52.550 --> 03:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
charging stations across the state and
 
03:33:54.530 --> 03:33:54.540 align:start position:0%
we're in the process of processing 13
 
03:33:57.830 --> 03:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
Grant app contracts right now to spend
 
03:34:00.530 --> 03:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
that 4.6 million dollars we've processed
 
03:34:02.210 --> 03:34:02.220 align:start position:0%
one or two through governor and Council
 
03:34:04.250 --> 03:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
we expect to have the rest of those
 
03:34:06.290 --> 03:34:06.300 align:start position:0%
contracts through this quarter
 
03:34:08.210 --> 03:34:08.220 align:start position:0%
uh this says we can spend up to four
 
03:34:08.220 --> 03:34:09.290 align:start position:0%
uh this says we can spend up to four
point

03:34:09.290 --> 03:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:34:15.830 --> 03:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:15.840 --> 03:34:17.690 align:start position:0%
 
competitive

03:34:17.690 --> 03:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
03:34:20.630 --> 03:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
placing diesel it's it's largely a staff
 
03:34:22.550 --> 03:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
an issue right now we only have so many
 
03:34:24.769 --> 03:34:24.779 align:start position:0%
staff members to help push this money
 
03:34:26.929 --> 03:34:26.939 align:start position:0%
through the goal of the mitigation trust
 
03:34:28.849 --> 03:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
was to spend the funds within 10 years
 
03:34:31.729 --> 03:34:31.739 align:start position:0%
the governor would wanted to get that
 
03:34:33.769 --> 03:34:33.779 align:start position:0%
done in seven years I don't think we'll
 
03:34:35.389 --> 03:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
quite make the seven years but we'll be
 
03:34:37.429 --> 03:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
well in advance of the 10 years okay
 
03:34:40.190 --> 03:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:41.809 --> 03:34:41.819 align:start position:0%
the only thing I was going to mention uh
 
03:34:43.250 --> 03:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
the 4.6 million dollars for
 
03:34:44.570 --> 03:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
administrative costs that's what's
 
03:34:46.490 --> 03:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
allowable under the trust we will not
 
03:34:48.229 --> 03:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
spend that and we'll we'll roll
 
03:34:50.630 --> 03:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
significant funds back into some of
 
03:34:52.370 --> 03:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
those other pots of money
 
03:34:54.769 --> 03:34:54.779 align:start position:0%
uh clean energy programs uh energies
 
03:34:56.630 --> 03:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
environmental you know we all go home
 
03:34:58.729 --> 03:34:58.739 align:start position:0%
turn on our lights we drive our cars uh
 
03:35:00.590 --> 03:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
that's all using energy that all creates
 
03:35:02.809 --> 03:35:02.819 align:start position:0%
environmental emissions we don't set
 
03:35:04.969 --> 03:35:04.979 align:start position:0%
energy policy that's not our role what
 
03:35:06.469 --> 03:35:06.479 align:start position:0%
we do is we serve as a technical
 
03:35:08.630 --> 03:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
resource for legislative policy
 
03:35:11.450 --> 03:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
commissions and we also work with the
 
03:35:14.090 --> 03:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
Department of energy again as a as a
 
03:35:15.650 --> 03:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
technical resource on environmental
 
03:35:17.389 --> 03:35:17.399 align:start position:0%
issues related to energy and energy
 
03:35:19.309 --> 03:35:19.319 align:start position:0%
consumption so this is some of the
 
03:35:21.950 --> 03:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
programs listed there that we help with
 
03:35:24.590 --> 03:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh the last slide I have is just a real
 
03:35:26.809 --> 03:35:26.819 align:start position:0%
I get asked all the time what how is the
 
03:35:28.490 --> 03:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
quality of air in New Hampshire and this
 
03:35:30.530 --> 03:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
chart is a really nice way of showing
 
03:35:33.650 --> 03:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
that uh shows our 10 counties and also a
 
03:35:35.090 --> 03:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
high elevation sites which is Mount
 
03:35:37.309 --> 03:35:37.319 align:start position:0%
Washington again in Pacman dad knock
 
03:35:39.110 --> 03:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
generally air quality issues in New
 
03:35:41.150 --> 03:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are ozone in the summer which
 
03:35:43.910 --> 03:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
is largely an Air transport issue from
 
03:35:45.710 --> 03:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
we're a downwind state but we do
 
03:35:47.570 --> 03:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
contribute to Ozone levels in New
 
03:35:49.550 --> 03:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well and also fine
 
03:35:50.990 --> 03:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
particulate matter in the winter time
 
03:35:53.570 --> 03:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
which is largely somewhat of a transport
 
03:35:56.150 --> 03:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
issue but also a very local issue would
 
03:35:58.070 --> 03:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh would especially with wood burning
 
03:36:00.110 --> 03:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
and Valley areas so
 
03:36:01.790 --> 03:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
um the green bar the green represents
 
03:36:03.229 --> 03:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
good air quality and you can see about
 
03:36:05.750 --> 03:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
90 of the days we have good air quality
 
03:36:07.429 --> 03:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the yellow represents
 
03:36:09.830 --> 03:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
moderate air quality and we have five to
 
03:36:11.630 --> 03:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
ten percent of our days reach that level
 
03:36:14.030 --> 03:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
and then for a handful of days three to
 
03:36:16.010 --> 03:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
five days a year we reach unhealthy for
 
03:36:17.990 --> 03:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
sensitive groups that's where we're
 
03:36:19.250 --> 03:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
actually exceeding those Federal
 
03:36:21.650 --> 03:36:21.660 align:start position:0%
health-based standards
 
03:36:24.710 --> 03:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
um I started at the division in I think
 
03:36:27.290 --> 03:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
1988 back then we probably it wouldn't
 
03:36:30.349 --> 03:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
be unheard of to have 25 or 30 days a
 
03:36:31.969 --> 03:36:31.979 align:start position:0%
year so we've come a long way in
 
03:36:34.429 --> 03:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
improving air quality our goal now is to
 
03:36:36.889 --> 03:36:36.899 align:start position:0%
get that last 10 percent of the job done
 
03:36:38.929 --> 03:36:38.939 align:start position:0%
and continue to maintain air quality in
 
03:36:40.670 --> 03:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so with that I can
 
03:36:42.370 --> 03:36:42.380 align:start position:0%
certainly answer questions
 
03:36:45.170 --> 03:36:45.180 align:start position:0%
for the air division representative
 
03:36:47.750 --> 03:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you how do these if air
 
03:36:49.670 --> 03:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
quality figures compared to other New
 
03:36:51.130 --> 03:36:51.140 align:start position:0%
England states
 
03:36:54.349 --> 03:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh generally I would say this is fairly
 
03:36:56.809 --> 03:36:56.819 align:start position:0%
consistent with Northern New England uh
 
03:36:58.670 --> 03:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
Maine New Hampshire and Vermont probably
 
03:37:01.550 --> 03:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
suffer or have generally the same air
 
03:37:03.769 --> 03:37:03.779 align:start position:0%
quality Southern New England has worse
 
03:37:05.330 --> 03:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
air quality in particular the
 
03:37:07.190 --> 03:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
Connecticut area the Long Island Sound
 
03:37:09.769 --> 03:37:09.779 align:start position:0%
and knowing in New York and New Jersey
 
03:37:12.710 --> 03:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
has worse air quality
 
03:37:14.990 --> 03:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't it yeah so I would assume
 
03:37:16.969 --> 03:37:16.979 align:start position:0%
your your area doesn't use a lot of
 
03:37:18.830 --> 03:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
General funds right that you you get
 
03:37:21.530 --> 03:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
money from permits and and fines and
 
03:37:25.010 --> 03:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
then reuse that for for staff yeah about
 
03:37:27.830 --> 03:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
50 of our the year's budget is uh fees
 
03:37:29.809 --> 03:37:29.819 align:start position:0%
we receive from regulated uh either
 
03:37:32.630 --> 03:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
companies or entities about 30 percent
 
03:37:35.210 --> 03:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
is federal funds probably
 
03:37:38.510 --> 03:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
um and then the remaining percent well
 
03:37:39.590 --> 03:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
actually less than that because we have
 
03:37:41.570 --> 03:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
some other small accounts but we get
 
03:37:43.370 --> 03:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
about half a million dollars a year in
 
03:37:47.570 --> 03:37:47.580 align:start position:0%
general funds okay and is fines much of
 
03:37:50.690 --> 03:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
a it's it's not a huge component
 
03:37:52.729 --> 03:37:52.739 align:start position:0%
um our general fines feel like the
 
03:37:54.650 --> 03:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
stationary sources the permanent sources
 
03:37:56.929 --> 03:37:56.939 align:start position:0%
do not go back to the division they go
 
03:37:58.969 --> 03:37:58.979 align:start position:0%
back to the state general fund the
 
03:38:01.670 --> 03:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
asbestos finds under State Statute do go
 
03:38:06.190 --> 03:38:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:08.210 --> 03:38:08.220 align:start position:0%
anyone else have a question no
 
03:38:10.429 --> 03:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair just a
 
03:38:13.190 --> 03:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
quick one uh what impact did the closure
 
03:38:14.929 --> 03:38:14.939 align:start position:0%
of the paper mills up north have on the
 
03:38:18.110 --> 03:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
air quality standards is that uh
 
03:38:20.389 --> 03:38:20.399 align:start position:0%
generally uh that paper mill was a very
 
03:38:23.210 --> 03:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
significant source of air pollution
 
03:38:24.710 --> 03:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
um obviously the shutdown of that
 
03:38:24.720 --> 03:38:26.210 align:start position:0%
um obviously the shutdown of that
facility

03:38:26.210 --> 03:38:26.220 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:38:28.190 --> 03:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
um generally would result in better air
 
03:38:30.469 --> 03:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
quality up north
 
03:38:30.479 --> 03:38:42.309 align:start position:0%
quality up north
yep

03:38:42.309 --> 03:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:46.309 --> 03:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
so um I can say we used to monitor up
 
03:38:47.870 --> 03:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
there for certain pollutants in that
 
03:38:50.090 --> 03:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
area we don't currently monitor for
 
03:38:51.530 --> 03:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
those pollutants anymore because those
 
03:38:53.090 --> 03:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
Mills are no longer there
 
03:38:55.790 --> 03:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
and that's largely CL carbon monoxide
 
03:38:58.190 --> 03:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
and sulfur dioxide I'm not sure I'm
 
03:39:01.670 --> 03:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:04.750 --> 03:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
I will say as a former director
 
03:39:08.269 --> 03:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
if I could so even before like the uh
 
03:39:10.670 --> 03:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
the pulp Mill uh in Berlin for instance
 
03:39:12.950 --> 03:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
closed they had
 
03:39:14.990 --> 03:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
a lot a lot of this was because of
 
03:39:17.150 --> 03:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
federal requirements but they had also
 
03:39:19.190 --> 03:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh compared to it historically they were
 
03:39:20.870 --> 03:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
much cleaner than they had been even
 
03:39:22.429 --> 03:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
before they closed so that's one of the
 
03:39:24.410 --> 03:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
reasons why the sulfur monitoring wasn't
 
03:39:24.420 --> 03:39:29.389 align:start position:0%
reasons why the sulfur monitoring wasn't
necessary

03:39:29.389 --> 03:39:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:32.150 --> 03:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative McGuire thank you
 
03:39:35.389 --> 03:39:35.399 align:start position:0%
is asbestos winding down I mean is there
 
03:39:37.610 --> 03:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
do we have a projected date when it'll
 
03:39:39.650 --> 03:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
be sort of over that is a great question
 
03:39:41.870 --> 03:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
I've been asking that question for years
 
03:39:45.710 --> 03:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
but we steadily continue to get about
 
03:39:47.510 --> 03:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
the same number of notifications year
 
03:39:49.910 --> 03:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
over year we have not seen a decline in
 
03:39:52.309 --> 03:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
that now some of that may be because a
 
03:39:53.510 --> 03:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
number of years ago there's been a lot
 
03:39:55.070 --> 03:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
of economic development in New Hampshire
 
03:39:56.809 --> 03:39:56.819 align:start position:0%
so there's probably been a lot of
 
03:39:59.510 --> 03:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
demolition Renovations going on but you
 
03:40:01.429 --> 03:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
would expect at some point that there
 
03:40:04.070 --> 03:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
would be a downturn but asbestos was
 
03:40:05.750 --> 03:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
very widely used in construction
 
03:40:10.429 --> 03:40:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:40:14.030 --> 03:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
thank you so now I'll introduce uh
 
03:40:16.550 --> 03:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
Rainey Pelletier he's our Water Division
 
03:40:18.950 --> 03:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
director and as you you'll if you didn't
 
03:40:20.330 --> 03:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
know before you will know by the time
 
03:40:21.950 --> 03:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
he's done this is our largest division
 
03:40:31.429 --> 03:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:34.070 --> 03:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
and that'll be better now that I can but
 
03:40:36.590 --> 03:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
Bob's got his stun gun so I can't talk
 
03:40:39.170 --> 03:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:39.180 --> 03:40:42.050 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:40:42.050 --> 03:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:44.090 --> 03:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
so as you can see with the largest
 
03:40:47.630 --> 03:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
Vision within the uh the agency we
 
03:40:51.170 --> 03:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
currently have some 234 people in place
 
03:40:54.670 --> 03:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
we have positions that are available for
 
03:40:57.830 --> 03:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
264. we've had quite a few retirements
 
03:40:59.210 --> 03:40:59.220 align:start position:0%
in the last
 
03:41:01.849 --> 03:41:01.859 align:start position:0%
oh several years I think last year we're
 
03:41:04.190 --> 03:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
not just in the water but in the agency
 
03:41:07.370 --> 03:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
like 20 or 22 people retiring people
 
03:41:10.429 --> 03:41:10.439 align:start position:0%
that were clearly smarter than I am
 
03:41:14.990 --> 03:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
so as we go we look at slide 23 there's
 
03:41:17.330 --> 03:41:17.340 align:start position:0%
eight bureaus and programs within the
 
03:41:19.309 --> 03:41:19.319 align:start position:0%
Water Division
 
03:41:21.349 --> 03:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
um we we have a lot of Permitting
 
03:41:23.330 --> 03:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
programs that take place and I think
 
03:41:26.210 --> 03:41:26.220 align:start position:0%
we're the largest eight part of the
 
03:41:28.849 --> 03:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
agency that deals with the personal
 
03:41:31.429 --> 03:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
property and folks on a day-to-day basis
 
03:41:34.670 --> 03:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
you know it's a lot of initiation and
 
03:41:41.330 --> 03:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:44.690 --> 03:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
and if you go to slide 24 it talks about
 
03:41:47.210 --> 03:41:47.220 align:start position:0%
the alteration of the train program and
 
03:41:49.070 --> 03:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
basically the intention of that program
 
03:41:52.309 --> 03:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
is any kind as a site is Disturbed
 
03:41:53.990 --> 03:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
greater than a hundred thousand square
 
03:41:56.269 --> 03:41:56.279 align:start position:0%
feet which is close to two and a half
 
03:41:58.969 --> 03:41:58.979 align:start position:0%
acres or fifty thousand square feet
 
03:42:01.070 --> 03:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
within the protected Shoreland Zone
 
03:42:04.670 --> 03:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
which is zero to 250 feet on great ponds
 
03:42:07.250 --> 03:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
in the State uh the whole goal of that
 
03:42:10.750 --> 03:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
program is to look at pre
 
03:42:13.210 --> 03:42:13.220 align:start position:0%
precipitation and post
 
03:42:15.950 --> 03:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
precipitation that comes off the site of
 
03:42:18.130 --> 03:42:18.140 align:start position:0%
stormwater control if you will
 
03:42:21.170 --> 03:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
that's a program that you would see like
 
03:42:23.269 --> 03:42:23.279 align:start position:0%
the large box stores that are built the
 
03:42:25.670 --> 03:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
Home Depots the Walmarts and anything
 
03:42:27.830 --> 03:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
basically that disturbs two and a half
 
03:42:29.870 --> 03:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
acres of soil
 
03:42:33.370 --> 03:42:33.380 align:start position:0%
if you go to slide 25 it's the
 
03:42:36.290 --> 03:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
subsurface systems program a lot of
 
03:42:38.090 --> 03:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
people may know that is the on-site
 
03:42:41.210 --> 03:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
Wastewater disposal program we deal with
 
03:42:44.570 --> 03:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
some five or six thousand permits a year
 
03:42:48.469 --> 03:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
for on on-site Wastewater and it's
 
03:42:50.750 --> 03:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
basically leech fields that people put
 
03:42:53.210 --> 03:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
in on their individual homes and one of
 
03:42:55.790 --> 03:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
the things I think that goes unnoticed
 
03:42:57.670 --> 03:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
that people don't really think about is
 
03:43:02.630 --> 03:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
septic systems by their design a meant
 
03:43:05.929 --> 03:43:05.939 align:start position:0%
to recharge groundwater so it's a
 
03:43:07.969 --> 03:43:07.979 align:start position:0%
program that's really important that the
 
03:43:09.830 --> 03:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
systems are built and they're
 
03:43:12.650 --> 03:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
technically designed correctly because
 
03:43:15.530 --> 03:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
the ultimate goal is is to all of the
 
03:43:17.090 --> 03:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
water that we use within the state
 
03:43:19.130 --> 03:43:19.140 align:start position:0%
whether it be in public water or private
 
03:43:22.450 --> 03:43:22.460 align:start position:0%
water is designed to go back into the
 
03:43:25.309 --> 03:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
resource so it's a very important
 
03:43:27.769 --> 03:43:27.779 align:start position:0%
program it's one of the few programs in
 
03:43:29.830 --> 03:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
the state where the permits that we
 
03:43:32.630 --> 03:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
Grant some fifty five hundred to six
 
03:43:35.870 --> 03:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
thousand when they're installed we also
 
03:43:38.389 --> 03:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
inspect them to make sure that they in
 
03:43:41.389 --> 03:43:41.399 align:start position:0%
fact are installed appropriately so they
 
03:43:43.130 --> 03:43:43.140 align:start position:0%
do in fact protect groundwater and
 
03:43:45.410 --> 03:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
surface waters
 
03:43:49.910 --> 03:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
if you go to slide slide 76 it's the
 
03:43:51.710 --> 03:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
Shoreland program and this program
 
03:43:55.250 --> 03:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
regulates activities on properties of 10
 
03:43:57.769 --> 03:43:57.779 align:start position:0%
on great ponds which are 10 acres or
 
03:44:02.450 --> 03:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
more from the mean lake level to 250
 
03:44:05.030 --> 03:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
feet back and that in fact it's a
 
03:44:06.590 --> 03:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
program that's designed to make sure
 
03:44:08.349 --> 03:44:08.359 align:start position:0%
that number one
 
03:44:13.190 --> 03:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
precipitation or roof drainage or any
 
03:44:16.090 --> 03:44:16.100 align:start position:0%
kind of event is
 
03:44:19.010 --> 03:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
adequately treated before it gets into a
 
03:44:21.530 --> 03:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
surface water it's been a very effective
 
03:44:24.710 --> 03:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
program in 98 it came in with a
 
03:44:28.190 --> 03:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
permitting requirement and we do that's
 
03:44:31.849 --> 03:44:31.859 align:start position:0%
a very active program and it's been
 
03:44:34.309 --> 03:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
quite effective I think a lot of it has
 
03:44:38.030 --> 03:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
a a result of why a water quality in
 
03:44:42.050 --> 03:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
lakes and ponds is is continuing to be
 
03:44:44.630 --> 03:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
in good shape although it's a diligent
 
03:44:48.530 --> 03:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
program and we can't forget to maintain
 
03:44:48.540 --> 03:44:49.729 align:start position:0%
program and we can't forget to maintain
it

03:44:49.729 --> 03:44:49.739 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:44:51.950 --> 03:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
slide 27
 
03:44:54.769 --> 03:44:54.779 align:start position:0%
is the wetlands Bureau and one thing
 
03:44:56.330 --> 03:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
about the wetlands Brewery should know
 
03:44:58.429 --> 03:44:58.439 align:start position:0%
is when we issue a permit there's also
 
03:45:01.729 --> 03:45:01.739 align:start position:0%
the Army Corps of Engineers looks at any
 
03:45:04.309 --> 03:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
impacts to Wetlands of surface waters on
 
03:45:07.389 --> 03:45:07.399 align:start position:0%
a Statewide or national basis actually
 
03:45:10.670 --> 03:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
so when we issue a permit for a Wetlands
 
03:45:13.910 --> 03:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
application it is also considered an
 
03:45:17.570 --> 03:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
Army Corps of Engineers permit if
 
03:45:20.090 --> 03:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
there's an apple an impact that's
 
03:45:22.370 --> 03:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
greater than three acres then the uh
 
03:45:24.170 --> 03:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
you'd have to get an individual permit
 
03:45:26.570 --> 03:45:26.580 align:start position:0%
from the Army Corps which could take you
 
03:45:29.450 --> 03:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
a year year and a half or two so the
 
03:45:31.490 --> 03:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
benefit of us being in that programmatic
 
03:45:34.010 --> 03:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
permit with the core really helps out
 
03:45:35.809 --> 03:45:35.819 align:start position:0%
the applicant the citizens of New
 
03:45:39.469 --> 03:45:39.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to move the permitting process
 
03:45:42.349 --> 03:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
along it's been quite effective I think
 
03:45:46.910 --> 03:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
we rarely get judged secondly on what we
 
03:45:48.950 --> 03:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
permit by the Army course so it's been
 
03:45:50.929 --> 03:45:50.939 align:start position:0%
pretty effective and it's really a win
 
03:45:54.469 --> 03:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:57.349 --> 03:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
if you go to page 28 the drinking water
 
03:45:59.570 --> 03:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
and groundwater Bureau
 
03:46:01.969 --> 03:46:01.979 align:start position:0%
excuse me the question representative
 
03:46:05.030 --> 03:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
McGuire okay this is something we were
 
03:46:08.330 --> 03:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
talking about earlier my my Builder uh
 
03:46:11.389 --> 03:46:11.399 align:start position:0%
told me that when he builds a septic
 
03:46:14.330 --> 03:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
house with a septic system in Maine he
 
03:46:16.969 --> 03:46:16.979 align:start position:0%
hires a licensed engineer they design it
 
03:46:20.389 --> 03:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
it's stamped and built whereas in New
 
03:46:22.790 --> 03:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the licensed engineer designs
 
03:46:25.729 --> 03:46:25.739 align:start position:0%
the septic system but then he has to go
 
03:46:28.790 --> 03:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
to the Des get another licensed engineer
 
03:46:31.150 --> 03:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
to look at the same thing and prove it
 
03:46:34.309 --> 03:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
again so we so the fees are much higher
 
03:46:34.319 --> 03:46:35.090 align:start position:0%
again so we so the fees are much higher
here

03:46:35.090 --> 03:46:35.100 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:46:38.809 --> 03:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
is that so or is it uh I don't want to
 
03:46:40.910 --> 03:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
say anything bad about Maine but no
 
03:46:42.710 --> 03:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
there's really no fee for the inspection
 
03:46:44.809 --> 03:46:44.819 align:start position:0%
you pay a one-time fee for the
 
03:46:47.690 --> 03:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
application which is 300 when it comes
 
03:46:50.570 --> 03:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
in now there's a cost of hiring a
 
03:46:54.830 --> 03:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
designer which we license and there's a
 
03:46:57.889 --> 03:46:57.899 align:start position:0%
cost obviously of hiring a licensed
 
03:46:57.899 --> 03:46:59.210 align:start position:0%
cost obviously of hiring a licensed
installer

03:46:59.210 --> 03:46:59.220 align:start position:0%
installer
 
03:47:02.150 --> 03:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
to install a system but there are no
 
03:47:03.950 --> 03:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
other permit fees that come to the
 
03:47:08.450 --> 03:47:08.460 align:start position:0%
agency so whether Maine hired someone or
 
03:47:10.969 --> 03:47:10.979 align:start position:0%
not or whoever installs a system they're
 
03:47:12.830 --> 03:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
going to pay somebody to install so I
 
03:47:14.090 --> 03:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
don't see that it would be any different
 
03:47:17.630 --> 03:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
my question is is there a second
 
03:47:19.929 --> 03:47:19.939 align:start position:0%
engineer in Des
 
03:47:22.910 --> 03:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
looking looking over the same design
 
03:47:25.849 --> 03:47:25.859 align:start position:0%
that the first engineer created
 
03:47:28.969 --> 03:47:28.979 align:start position:0%
you may need let's define the first and
 
03:47:30.889 --> 03:47:30.899 align:start position:0%
second engineer you're talking about the
 
03:47:33.889 --> 03:47:33.899 align:start position:0%
engineer that submits the plan yes yes
 
03:47:37.610 --> 03:47:37.620 align:start position:0%
that comes in a des it is reviewed by
 
03:47:39.769 --> 03:47:39.779 align:start position:0%
staff in the subsurface program and I
 
03:47:41.450 --> 03:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
would very proud that our turnaround
 
03:47:44.750 --> 03:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
time is one day historically and then
 
03:47:46.969 --> 03:47:46.979 align:start position:0%
that goes out to the homeowner and the
 
03:47:49.729 --> 03:47:49.739 align:start position:0%
designer and they hire who would they
 
03:47:52.729 --> 03:47:52.739 align:start position:0%
choose to install the system okay thank
 
03:47:52.739 --> 03:47:58.670 align:start position:0%
choose to install the system okay thank
you

03:47:58.670 --> 03:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:01.550 --> 03:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
okay side 28 we're talking about the
 
03:48:03.290 --> 03:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
drinking water and groundwater Bureau
 
03:48:05.330 --> 03:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
it's one of the larger bureaus within
 
03:48:07.790 --> 03:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
the division it deals with all public
 
03:48:10.610 --> 03:48:10.620 align:start position:0%
water supplies we do in fact monitor
 
03:48:13.010 --> 03:48:13.020 align:start position:0%
some 2600 Public Water Systems
 
03:48:15.830 --> 03:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and those go from
 
03:48:17.990 --> 03:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
the Manchester's to the nashuas or the
 
03:48:21.710 --> 03:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
pennichucks of the world to uh 25 Union
 
03:48:24.729 --> 03:48:24.739 align:start position:0%
or 20 unit mobile home park or
 
03:48:27.469 --> 03:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
senior housing or anything on them that
 
03:48:30.050 --> 03:48:30.060 align:start position:0%
magnitude and we're responsible to make
 
03:48:31.910 --> 03:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
sure that their water quality is good
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
they sample on a monthly basis some of
 
03:48:36.710 --> 03:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
the smallest systems on a quarterly
 
03:48:39.110 --> 03:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
basis to make sure that in fact the
 
03:48:40.849 --> 03:48:40.859 align:start position:0%
water that they're delivering to their
 
03:48:44.690 --> 03:48:44.700 align:start position:0%
residents is is safe to drink they also
 
03:48:48.110 --> 03:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
are a major part of the when Susan did
 
03:48:52.010 --> 03:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
the funding the drinking water program
 
03:48:55.729 --> 03:48:55.739 align:start position:0%
also has 75 million I think they spent
 
03:48:58.370 --> 03:48:58.380 align:start position:0%
this year in apple money for the srf
 
03:49:01.790 --> 03:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
program him so they they oversee a large
 
03:49:04.190 --> 03:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
loan and grant program for drinking
 
03:49:06.410 --> 03:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
water and much like the Wastewater
 
03:49:11.269 --> 03:49:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:15.889 --> 03:49:15.899 align:start position:0%
so slide 29 we go over the dam Bureau we
 
03:49:18.349 --> 03:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
have a two crews in the dam bureau
 
03:49:21.590 --> 03:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
there's about 22 people strong we have a
 
03:49:25.269 --> 03:49:25.279 align:start position:0%
construction crew and a design crew
 
03:49:29.929 --> 03:49:29.939 align:start position:0%
monitor so we in fact regulate damp 274
 
03:49:32.570 --> 03:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
state-owned dams that we work on there's
 
03:49:32.580 --> 03:49:33.790 align:start position:0%
state-owned dams that we work on there's
some

03:49:33.790 --> 03:49:33.800 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:49:36.950 --> 03:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
2400 to 2600 dams throughout the state
 
03:49:40.610 --> 03:49:40.620 align:start position:0%
privates but the state owns 274. some of
 
03:49:42.530 --> 03:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
the dams that would be notable of like
 
03:49:44.809 --> 03:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
the Lakeport Dam that controls Lake
 
03:49:44.819 --> 03:49:46.090 align:start position:0%
the Lakeport Dam that controls Lake
Winnipesaukee

03:49:46.090 --> 03:49:46.100 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee
 
03:49:49.630 --> 03:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
and many of the lakes that we do
 
03:49:52.309 --> 03:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
regulate are own regulated by
 
03:49:54.290 --> 03:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
state-owned dams and it's a very
 
03:49:55.630 --> 03:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
important function
 
03:49:58.729 --> 03:49:58.739 align:start position:0%
it's a very active program especially we
 
03:50:01.429 --> 03:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
have a significant storm event as you've
 
03:50:03.050 --> 03:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
all seen we have to control the
 
03:50:06.170 --> 03:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
discharges of those lakes and it's uh
 
03:50:08.150 --> 03:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
it's really a full-time job we're
 
03:50:10.030 --> 03:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
fortunate to have a really
 
03:50:13.429 --> 03:50:13.439 align:start position:0%
active staff they work very hard to get
 
03:50:16.429 --> 03:50:16.439 align:start position:0%
out to make sure that people Downstream
 
03:50:18.410 --> 03:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
from a dam aren't getting flooded out
 
03:50:19.729 --> 03:50:19.739 align:start position:0%
and those types of things and even
 
03:50:23.389 --> 03:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
Upstream if you remember back some 14 or
 
03:50:26.510 --> 03:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
15 years ago we had significant rain
 
03:50:29.090 --> 03:50:29.100 align:start position:0%
event a lot of snow that year in Lake
 
03:50:31.070 --> 03:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee was Headway speed only
 
03:50:32.929 --> 03:50:32.939 align:start position:0%
because of all the boathouses the
 
03:50:35.570 --> 03:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
property was getting flooded we had
 
03:50:38.809 --> 03:50:38.819 align:start position:0%
people working 24 7 for quite a while to
 
03:50:40.849 --> 03:50:40.859 align:start position:0%
try and control as much of that flow as
 
03:50:43.250 --> 03:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
we had one thing that you want to be
 
03:50:46.130 --> 03:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
aware of is dams of design first of all
 
03:50:49.190 --> 03:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
in the olden days for Mills to generate
 
03:50:51.650 --> 03:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
power the dams that the state now has
 
03:50:55.130 --> 03:50:55.140 align:start position:0%
taken over regulate a resource for a lot
 
03:50:57.769 --> 03:50:57.779 align:start position:0%
of it for recreation fishing and all the
 
03:51:00.650 --> 03:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
other issues so it's really important
 
03:51:04.610 --> 03:51:04.620 align:start position:0%
thing that the dam program does and it's
 
03:51:07.370 --> 03:51:07.380 align:start position:0%
it's really important to how the state
 
03:51:10.490 --> 03:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
gets to use a valuable resource us
 
03:51:12.830 --> 03:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
whether it be boating kayaking canoeing
 
03:51:15.050 --> 03:51:15.060 align:start position:0%
fishing or whatever so it's been a very
 
03:51:19.070 --> 03:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
effective program in the kudos to the
 
03:51:21.889 --> 03:51:21.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:21.899 --> 03:51:26.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:51:26.510 --> 03:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:29.690 --> 03:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
probably a decade ago or less or plus or
 
03:51:31.429 --> 03:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
minus the damn maintenance fund was
 
03:51:33.650 --> 03:51:33.660 align:start position:0%
drying up
 
03:51:35.750 --> 03:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
what's the status of that now and what
 
03:51:37.550 --> 03:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
did you do to correctly
 
03:51:42.650 --> 03:51:42.660 align:start position:0%
no so I should probably let uh my budget
 
03:51:44.690 --> 03:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
wizard I think we did get some general
 
03:51:53.769 --> 03:51:53.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:57.349 --> 03:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
785 000 Surplus
 
03:51:59.630 --> 03:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
um we've managed through
 
03:51:59.640 --> 03:52:00.530 align:start position:0%
um we've managed through
um

03:52:00.530 --> 03:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:04.490 --> 03:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
using various sources to pay for the dam
 
03:52:06.530 --> 03:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
repairs and maintenance
 
03:52:08.809 --> 03:52:08.819 align:start position:0%
um in order to keep that fund back up
 
03:52:11.929 --> 03:52:11.939 align:start position:0%
into a healthy balance well I guess that
 
03:52:13.969 --> 03:52:13.979 align:start position:0%
leads to me to my question is what is
 
03:52:16.010 --> 03:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
done to assure that that doesn't happen
 
03:52:18.950 --> 03:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
again so are the fees for oh if I may
 
03:52:20.510 --> 03:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
yeah are the fees for the dam
 
03:52:22.250 --> 03:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
maintenance fund
 
03:52:27.590 --> 03:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
um adequate to do that or or what what
 
03:52:29.150 --> 03:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
are we doing so
 
03:52:31.250 --> 03:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
um you're assured that there's adequate
 
03:52:32.929 --> 03:52:32.939 align:start position:0%
funds there what resources are you
 
03:52:32.939 --> 03:52:34.220 align:start position:0%
funds there what resources are you
utilizing

03:52:34.220 --> 03:52:34.230 align:start position:0%
utilizing
 
03:52:34.230 --> 03:52:37.190 align:start position:0%
utilizing
[Music]

03:52:37.190 --> 03:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:52:38.870 --> 03:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
03:52:41.389 --> 03:52:41.399 align:start position:0%
of the funds from water user fees so
 
03:52:43.969 --> 03:52:43.979 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make an hyperfeed so
 
03:52:45.590 --> 03:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make sure that we stay
 
03:52:48.650 --> 03:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
current in all those contracts and uh
 
03:52:50.870 --> 03:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
um those fees are that revenue is coming
 
03:52:54.950 --> 03:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
into us we also tap into the capital
 
03:52:58.070 --> 03:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
fund because a large number of this crew
 
03:53:00.650 --> 03:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
is working on major Dam repair and
 
03:53:03.889 --> 03:53:03.899 align:start position:0%
reconstructions and we augment that
 
03:53:07.070 --> 03:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
income with Capital One so the for me
 
03:53:09.050 --> 03:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
that's that brings me back to and you
 
03:53:10.849 --> 03:53:10.859 align:start position:0%
hit upon it it was drying up because we
 
03:53:13.070 --> 03:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
were pretty much relying on the flow
 
03:53:17.510 --> 03:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
fees for uh generation and and that was
 
03:53:19.910 --> 03:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
problematic so what you're doing is
 
03:53:22.910 --> 03:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
using a multitude of resource funds to
 
03:53:26.929 --> 03:53:26.939 align:start position:0%
address that in the fees from the flow
 
03:53:26.939 --> 03:53:28.910 align:start position:0%
address that in the fees from the flow
um

03:53:28.910 --> 03:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:32.090 --> 03:53:32.100 align:start position:0%
still aren't adequate to maintain that
 
03:53:35.269 --> 03:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
is that not correct
 
03:53:38.150 --> 03:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
and if I may would they ever be adequate
 
03:53:40.910 --> 03:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
that was the original idea that didn't
 
03:53:43.130 --> 03:53:43.140 align:start position:0%
seem to work too well
 
03:53:51.229 --> 03:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:53.150 --> 03:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
03:53:56.690 --> 03:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
thank you um is there much interest in
 
03:53:58.910 --> 03:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
um getting rid of dams at this point
 
03:54:02.469 --> 03:54:02.479 align:start position:0%
since we have almost 2600
 
03:54:04.750 --> 03:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:54:07.490 --> 03:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
well you know I think there a lot of
 
03:54:08.990 --> 03:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
these are one of the river dams that
 
03:54:10.729 --> 03:54:10.739 align:start position:0%
have been built as you know years and
 
03:54:13.010 --> 03:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
years ago and I think when there's an
 
03:54:15.650 --> 03:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
opportunity depending on the ownership I
 
03:54:17.349 --> 03:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
think a lot of the state-owned dams
 
03:54:20.030 --> 03:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
protect the resource that's used for
 
03:54:21.769 --> 03:54:21.779 align:start position:0%
recreation a lot of those types of
 
03:54:23.750 --> 03:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
things but a lot of the older one of the
 
03:54:26.929 --> 03:54:26.939 align:start position:0%
river dams we do take an opportunity
 
03:54:29.090 --> 03:54:29.100 align:start position:0%
when the owner of that facility is
 
03:54:32.050 --> 03:54:32.060 align:start position:0%
willing to work with us we try and find
 
03:54:35.330 --> 03:54:35.340 align:start position:0%
several means of funding to remove them
 
03:54:37.790 --> 03:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
so we can get back to fish passage and
 
03:54:40.550 --> 03:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
where are you so I mean if I were to be
 
03:54:44.269 --> 03:54:44.279 align:start position:0%
candid that if we could get rid of a lot
 
03:54:46.250 --> 03:54:46.260 align:start position:0%
of those but a lot of them we don't own
 
03:54:48.170 --> 03:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
so there's got to be a partnership and
 
03:54:49.750 --> 03:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
how that's funded
 
03:54:52.490 --> 03:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
and I think a lot of people have those
 
03:54:54.889 --> 03:54:54.899 align:start position:0%
smaller dams and on for the big bodies
 
03:54:57.590 --> 03:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
of water we talk about that have an
 
03:55:00.229 --> 03:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
impoundment that they enjoy there may be
 
03:55:03.110 --> 03:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
20 houses on the small impoundment and
 
03:55:04.729 --> 03:55:04.739 align:start position:0%
so in many cases it's very very
 
03:55:07.670 --> 03:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
difficult to get a consensus of people
 
03:55:10.450 --> 03:55:10.460 align:start position:0%
that would be willing to
 
03:55:12.590 --> 03:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
investigate removal
 
03:55:15.710 --> 03:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
so but if we could remove them probably
 
03:55:18.830 --> 03:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
the best thing for the resource would be
 
03:55:18.840 --> 03:55:22.610 align:start position:0%
the best thing for the resource would be
removal

03:55:22.610 --> 03:55:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:22.620 --> 03:55:23.809 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:55:23.809 --> 03:55:23.819 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:55:23.819 --> 03:55:25.490 align:start position:0%
so
yes

03:55:25.490 --> 03:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:55:27.769 --> 03:55:27.779 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
03:55:31.130 --> 03:55:31.140 align:start position:0%
are is almost all dams there for
 
03:55:33.950 --> 03:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
recreation and not for reservoirs or
 
03:55:36.830 --> 03:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
electric Generation Well some a lot of
 
03:55:39.050 --> 03:55:39.060 align:start position:0%
the dams we have that's the fee that
 
03:55:40.729 --> 03:55:40.739 align:start position:0%
representative hatch was talking about
 
03:55:44.150 --> 03:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
do p pay a fee to a state-owned dam for
 
03:55:46.250 --> 03:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
a hydro facility and they're Frick
 
03:55:48.769 --> 03:55:48.779 align:start position:0%
regulated a lot of the other dams were
 
03:55:51.889 --> 03:55:51.899 align:start position:0%
built years ago the ones that weren't
 
03:55:54.290 --> 03:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
built for power and energy for Mills and
 
03:55:57.530 --> 03:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
so forth are built for about
 
03:56:00.170 --> 03:56:00.180 align:start position:0%
or flood control were built for
 
03:56:03.349 --> 03:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
recreational persons however it wasn't
 
03:56:05.269 --> 03:56:05.279 align:start position:0%
like like when a Squam or a
 
03:56:08.210 --> 03:56:08.220 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee so a lot of people have a
 
03:56:09.229 --> 03:56:09.239 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
03:56:12.530 --> 03:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
vested interest in keeping those because
 
03:56:15.110 --> 03:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
they if there's 20 homes on a small
 
03:56:17.150 --> 03:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
empowerment they use it to kayak and
 
03:56:18.950 --> 03:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
fish and so forth so
 
03:56:22.670 --> 03:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
there's a multitude of uses in what dams
 
03:56:22.680 --> 03:56:23.450 align:start position:0%
there's a multitude of uses in what dams
do

03:56:23.450 --> 03:56:23.460 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:56:25.790 --> 03:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
but a lot of it is generally over the
 
03:56:27.769 --> 03:56:27.779 align:start position:0%
years the big ones are always for power
 
03:56:30.170 --> 03:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
and the smaller ones for we're
 
03:56:32.630 --> 03:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
empowerment and flood control
 
03:56:34.670 --> 03:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
but not really to create drinking water
 
03:56:37.849 --> 03:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
no there were some dams like pogus Bay
 
03:56:40.429 --> 03:56:40.439 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee is an intake for Laconia
 
03:56:43.910 --> 03:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
Waterworks and we do have basins up
 
03:56:46.070 --> 03:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester Massachusetts that's their
 
03:56:48.889 --> 03:56:48.899 align:start position:0%
water intake but the Lion's Share of
 
03:56:51.769 --> 03:56:51.779 align:start position:0%
dams are not for drinking water and
 
03:56:54.889 --> 03:56:54.899 align:start position:0%
they're generally uh and we try and get
 
03:56:56.450 --> 03:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
people to the point where the treatment
 
03:56:58.429 --> 03:56:58.439 align:start position:0%
costs are a lot less if they use ground
 
03:57:00.590 --> 03:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
Waters the drinking water source so
 
03:57:03.050 --> 03:57:03.060 align:start position:0%
people generally go that route first and
 
03:57:05.750 --> 03:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
foremost if they don't have any luck in
 
03:57:07.729 --> 03:57:07.739 align:start position:0%
achieving that then in fact they look
 
03:57:10.309 --> 03:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
for surface water thank you
 
03:57:10.319 --> 03:57:15.889 align:start position:0%
for surface water thank you
foreign

03:57:15.889 --> 03:57:15.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:22.309 --> 03:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
so if I go to slide 31 it's the last
 
03:57:24.950 --> 03:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
Bureau within the department and it's
 
03:57:26.570 --> 03:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
the Wastewater engineering Bureau
 
03:57:28.309 --> 03:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
they're the folks that oversee all the
 
03:57:30.229 --> 03:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facilities within
 
03:57:33.110 --> 03:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
the state we have a very active operated
 
03:57:36.050 --> 03:57:36.060 align:start position:0%
certification program as you may may not
 
03:57:39.349 --> 03:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
know all Municipal in any wastewater
 
03:57:41.389 --> 03:57:41.399 align:start position:0%
treatment plant has to have a certified
 
03:57:44.510 --> 03:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
operator to run that facility and we
 
03:57:47.030 --> 03:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
also Grant permits for the discharges
 
03:57:48.590 --> 03:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
that come out of those Wastewater
 
03:57:51.229 --> 03:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
facilities they generate there are a few
 
03:57:53.110 --> 03:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
in the state that go to the groundwater
 
03:57:56.870 --> 03:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
and generally into what we call
 
03:58:01.309 --> 03:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
uh-oh I'm getting the boot and they have
 
03:58:03.229 --> 03:58:03.239 align:start position:0%
a discharge to the surface water at some
 
03:58:05.150 --> 03:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
point in time which we regulate as well
 
03:58:07.250 --> 03:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that what's going into
 
03:58:09.650 --> 03:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
the water resources is safe and
 
03:58:09.660 --> 03:58:11.769 align:start position:0%
the water resources is safe and
protected

03:58:11.769 --> 03:58:11.779 align:start position:0%
protected
 
03:58:14.689 --> 03:58:14.699 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll the one and last
 
03:58:17.450 --> 03:58:17.460 align:start position:0%
slide 33 is the Winnipesaukee River
 
03:58:19.610 --> 03:58:19.620 align:start position:0%
Basin that's located in Franklin New
 
03:58:21.830 --> 03:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as you can see on the slides
 
03:58:26.090 --> 03:58:26.100 align:start position:0%
we have some 10 communities that that we
 
03:58:28.250 --> 03:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
have in the state budget system but that
 
03:58:30.610 --> 03:58:30.620 align:start position:0%
is totally funded by the 10 communities
 
03:58:33.170 --> 03:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
that discharge waste water to that
 
03:58:35.870 --> 03:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
facility we have state employees that
 
03:58:39.889 --> 03:58:39.899 align:start position:0%
run that facility it was built in 1974
 
03:58:42.170 --> 03:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
as you might imagine it's got a lot of
 
03:58:43.729 --> 03:58:43.739 align:start position:0%
infrastructure needs and upgrades
 
03:58:47.750 --> 03:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
necessary but it's been probably one of
 
03:58:50.330 --> 03:58:50.340 align:start position:0%
the the only one that I'm aware of in
 
03:58:51.650 --> 03:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
the country where the state owns a
 
03:58:54.229 --> 03:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
treatment Wastewater Plant so it's very
 
03:58:56.689 --> 03:58:56.699 align:start position:0%
unique but we've been fortunate to have
 
03:58:59.330 --> 03:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
some really good staff and I think it
 
03:59:01.250 --> 03:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
really has gone a long way to clean up
 
03:59:03.950 --> 03:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
the Lakes Region as far as Wastewater
 
03:59:06.590 --> 03:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
03:59:10.189 --> 03:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:11.570 --> 03:59:11.580 align:start position:0%
and just a finer point on the
 
03:59:12.950 --> 03:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee River Basin the wastewater
 
03:59:15.889 --> 03:59:15.899 align:start position:0%
treatment plant that that is user funded
 
03:59:17.450 --> 03:59:17.460 align:start position:0%
that's not funded out of General funds
 
03:59:17.460 --> 03:59:21.950 align:start position:0%
that's not funded out of General funds
right

03:59:21.950 --> 03:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:25.490 --> 03:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
so thank you Randy so uh Mike you get a
 
03:59:28.370 --> 03:59:28.380 align:start position:0%
whole five minutes I think you were
 
03:59:30.769 --> 03:59:30.779 align:start position:0%
is uh I'd like to introduce Mike Wimsatt
 
03:59:33.530 --> 03:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
with the waste management division
 
03:59:35.330 --> 03:59:35.340 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again my name is Mike
 
03:59:37.309 --> 03:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
Wimsatt a service director of the waste
 
03:59:39.410 --> 03:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
division for the record and uh my last
 
03:59:41.990 --> 03:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
name begins with W so I long ago made my
 
03:59:44.750 --> 03:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
peace with going last
 
03:59:46.910 --> 03:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
so I'll try I know that you've got other
 
03:59:48.530 --> 03:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
folks waiting out in the lobby so I'll
 
03:59:50.929 --> 03:59:50.939 align:start position:0%
try to be as brief as I can be I think
 
03:59:52.550 --> 03:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
the most concise way to think of the
 
03:59:53.929 --> 03:59:53.939 align:start position:0%
waste management division is we really
 
03:59:56.570 --> 03:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
have two core functions one is we want
 
03:59:59.150 --> 03:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
to help people and ensure that
 
04:00:01.010 --> 04:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
um the materials and waste that they
 
04:00:03.530 --> 04:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
generate are managed properly and then
 
04:00:05.689 --> 04:00:05.699 align:start position:0%
when they when that doesn't work out we
 
04:00:07.309 --> 04:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
have programs to investigate and
 
04:00:10.429 --> 04:00:10.439 align:start position:0%
remediate any releases that occur
 
04:00:12.950 --> 04:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna I these slides I think will
 
04:00:14.330 --> 04:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
speak for themselves I'm going to skip
 
04:00:16.790 --> 04:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
over this in the interest of time as far
 
04:00:18.530 --> 04:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
as petroleum products go that's really
 
04:00:19.910 --> 04:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
the only sort of material that we
 
04:00:21.290 --> 04:00:21.300 align:start position:0%
regulate the rest of the things we
 
04:00:23.570 --> 04:00:23.580 align:start position:0%
regulate are either solid or hazardous
 
04:00:25.309 --> 04:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
waste but we do have a very active
 
04:00:27.229 --> 04:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
program for ensuring that both
 
04:00:28.729 --> 04:00:28.739 align:start position:0%
underground and above ground storage
 
04:00:30.830 --> 04:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
tanks are properly designed and
 
04:00:33.290 --> 04:00:33.300 align:start position:0%
maintained and operated to prevent
 
04:00:37.130 --> 04:00:37.140 align:start position:0%
releases of petroleum we do administer a
 
04:00:40.189 --> 04:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
uh oil fund or oil discharge disposal
 
04:00:42.590 --> 04:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
cleanup fund which is distributed
 
04:00:44.269 --> 04:00:44.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 12 and 14 million
 
04:00:46.070 --> 04:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
dollars a year in reimbursements for
 
04:00:48.530 --> 04:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
eligible parties who have had a release
 
04:00:50.510 --> 04:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
to do the investigation cleanup and
 
04:00:52.070 --> 04:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
monitoring of any releases that have
 
04:00:55.189 --> 04:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
occurred on the on the prevention side
 
04:00:57.769 --> 04:00:57.779 align:start position:0%
for both solid and hazardous waste we
 
04:00:59.450 --> 04:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
have a solid waste management Bureau and
 
04:01:01.729 --> 04:01:01.739 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste management Bureau and
 
04:01:03.889 --> 04:01:03.899 align:start position:0%
they perform a variety of activities
 
04:01:05.630 --> 04:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
related to compliance assurance and
 
04:01:08.090 --> 04:01:08.100 align:start position:0%
inspections of solid and hazardous waste
 
04:01:10.370 --> 04:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
facilities facility design and review
 
04:01:12.229 --> 04:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
and permitting particularly for solid
 
04:01:13.929 --> 04:01:13.939 align:start position:0%
waste landfills and that sort of thing
 
04:01:17.150 --> 04:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
we also track all the Hazardous Waste
 
04:01:18.950 --> 04:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
shipments that occur through a federal
 
04:01:20.809 --> 04:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
manifest system that's required when
 
04:01:22.490 --> 04:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste to ship to ensure that
 
04:01:24.349 --> 04:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
it gets delivered to an appropriate
 
04:01:27.530 --> 04:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
facility and we also through all of our
 
04:01:30.229 --> 04:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
programs maintain the ability to perform
 
04:01:32.809 --> 04:01:32.819 align:start position:0%
complaint investigations when we receive
 
04:01:35.570 --> 04:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
citizen complaints important to note
 
04:01:38.389 --> 04:01:38.399 align:start position:0%
that we do provide the 24 7 365
 
04:01:41.389 --> 04:01:41.399 align:start position:0%
emergency response capability we have
 
04:01:43.790 --> 04:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
someone on call all the time and we
 
04:01:45.710 --> 04:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
serve primarily we really work very
 
04:01:47.269 --> 04:01:47.279 align:start position:0%
closely with local fire departments
 
04:01:49.250 --> 04:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
they're the First Responders and when
 
04:01:50.570 --> 04:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
they run into something where they need
 
04:01:52.910 --> 04:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
our Assistance or guidance we always
 
04:01:54.349 --> 04:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
have someone they can call no matter
 
04:01:56.809 --> 04:01:56.819 align:start position:0%
what time a day or night that may occur
 
04:01:58.849 --> 04:01:58.859 align:start position:0%
and we maintain the ability to go out
 
04:02:01.070 --> 04:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
and respond and provide assistance and
 
04:02:02.990 --> 04:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
also hire contractors when the need
 
04:02:03.000 --> 04:02:04.670 align:start position:0%
also hire contractors when the need
arises

04:02:04.670 --> 04:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
arises
 
04:02:07.490 --> 04:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
um we also do maintain a very active
 
04:02:10.250 --> 04:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
program out on the Seacoast to ensure
 
04:02:12.110 --> 04:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
that the petroleum products that are
 
04:02:14.210 --> 04:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
stored on the piscataqua river are
 
04:02:15.710 --> 04:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
managed properly and if there's and
 
04:02:17.410 --> 04:02:17.420 align:start position:0%
being prepared if there's a release
 
04:02:19.790 --> 04:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
primarily to protect Great Bay because
 
04:02:22.490 --> 04:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
that would be sort of the big risk of a
 
04:02:24.469 --> 04:02:24.479 align:start position:0%
resource out there if we were to have a
 
04:02:26.330 --> 04:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
significant petroleum spill
 
04:02:28.490 --> 04:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
on the cleanup investigation side of the
 
04:02:30.349 --> 04:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
house I mentioned the oil discharge and
 
04:02:33.769 --> 04:02:33.779 align:start position:0%
Disposal cleanup fund we also manage
 
04:02:37.849 --> 04:02:37.859 align:start position:0%
about 600 hazardous waste sites and 22
 
04:02:40.370 --> 04:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
Superfund sites and really the primary
 
04:02:42.710 --> 04:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
way that we deal with that is we we try
 
04:02:44.389 --> 04:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
to prevent exposure to contaminants
 
04:02:46.189 --> 04:02:46.199 align:start position:0%
means we want to make sure when there is
 
04:02:47.450 --> 04:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
a release that it's investigated
 
04:02:49.670 --> 04:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
properly and assessed and then that we
 
04:02:51.769 --> 04:02:51.779 align:start position:0%
make risk-based decisions about how best
 
04:02:54.410 --> 04:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
to clean that up
 
04:02:56.210 --> 04:02:56.220 align:start position:0%
um also it's been mentioned the drinking
 
04:02:58.130 --> 04:02:58.140 align:start position:0%
one and groundwater trust fund and just
 
04:02:59.630 --> 04:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
to clarify on that if there's any
 
04:03:02.269 --> 04:03:02.279 align:start position:0%
confusion that was first capitalized
 
04:03:04.729 --> 04:03:04.739 align:start position:0%
with two there was a 236 million dollar
 
04:03:07.189 --> 04:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
trial verdict but because of uh interest
 
04:03:09.530 --> 04:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
accruals and that sort of thing when all
 
04:03:11.570 --> 04:03:11.580 align:start position:0%
was said and done 280 million dollars
 
04:03:13.729 --> 04:03:13.739 align:start position:0%
went to that drink you want a
 
04:03:15.050 --> 04:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund that was created
 
04:03:17.510 --> 04:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
by the legislature uh and again that's
 
04:03:20.330 --> 04:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
administered by a commission that we
 
04:03:22.429 --> 04:03:22.439 align:start position:0%
work very closely with Mr Scott serves
 
04:03:23.689 --> 04:03:23.699 align:start position:0%
as one of the Commissioners on that
 
04:03:26.330 --> 04:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
19-member commission and to answer the
 
04:03:28.610 --> 04:03:28.620 align:start position:0%
question about you know its lifespan the
 
04:03:30.650 --> 04:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
commission gets an update every year on
 
04:03:32.210 --> 04:03:32.220 align:start position:0%
the status of that and they make
 
04:03:33.769 --> 04:03:33.779 align:start position:0%
decisions about how much they're going
 
04:03:35.389 --> 04:03:35.399 align:start position:0%
to make in Grants and Loans each year
 
04:03:37.670 --> 04:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
with an eye toward trying to manage that
 
04:03:39.530 --> 04:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
fund as a legacy fund for many many
 
04:03:41.870 --> 04:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
years to come so they can adjust that on
 
04:03:43.910 --> 04:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
an annual basis about how much they're
 
04:03:46.070 --> 04:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
going to make in Grants and loans and
 
04:03:47.510 --> 04:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
then again as the commissioner indicated
 
04:03:50.030 --> 04:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
pfas dominates the tremendous amount of
 
04:03:50.990 --> 04:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
our time
 
04:03:53.210 --> 04:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
um we are managing some significant
 
04:03:55.429 --> 04:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
sites in Southern New Hampshire but we
 
04:03:57.410 --> 04:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
do have pfas impacts across the state
 
04:04:00.110 --> 04:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
and we do have a very active rebate
 
04:04:01.729 --> 04:04:01.739 align:start position:0%
program for folks who want to treat
 
04:04:04.189 --> 04:04:04.199 align:start position:0%
their drinking water at their home they
 
04:04:06.710 --> 04:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
can put in an in-home treatment system
 
04:04:09.229 --> 04:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
and apply for a rebate for to offset the
 
04:04:11.750 --> 04:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
cost of that and we also administer a
 
04:04:14.389 --> 04:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
pfas loan and grant program largely to
 
04:04:17.210 --> 04:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
that's primarily targeted at public
 
04:04:18.889 --> 04:04:18.899 align:start position:0%
drinking water systems that need to put
 
04:04:20.510 --> 04:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
treatment on to make sure that the
 
04:04:21.710 --> 04:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
public drinking water that they
 
04:04:23.689 --> 04:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
distribute to their system meets
 
04:04:25.610 --> 04:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
standards and that's a whirlwind tour of
 
04:04:27.170 --> 04:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
the waste management division I'll be
 
04:04:30.590 --> 04:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:33.590 --> 04:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative evil yeah um I guess I
 
04:04:34.729 --> 04:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
wondered I know you know you don't want
 
04:04:36.889 --> 04:04:36.899 align:start position:0%
to talk about pfas that much but as well
 
04:04:39.889 --> 04:04:39.899 align:start position:0%
uh considering pfas and emerging
 
04:04:43.370 --> 04:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
contaminants I wonder how money how much
 
04:04:46.189 --> 04:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
strain all of the um
 
04:04:49.070 --> 04:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
testing requirements all the flood of
 
04:04:52.250 --> 04:04:52.260 align:start position:0%
pfas into the system how that strains
 
04:04:54.309 --> 04:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
both the wastewater treatment system
 
04:04:57.410 --> 04:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
landfill systems that's like a really
 
04:05:00.229 --> 04:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
big soccer question but I I think it's
 
04:05:02.870 --> 04:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
important to understand the effects of
 
04:05:04.969 --> 04:05:04.979 align:start position:0%
all these things groundwater wise
 
04:05:06.889 --> 04:05:06.899 align:start position:0%
surface water and then the strain on
 
04:05:09.290 --> 04:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
Municipal and business budgets sure
 
04:05:10.969 --> 04:05:10.979 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question the short
 
04:05:12.769 --> 04:05:12.779 align:start position:0%
answer is is that anybody who is
 
04:05:14.450 --> 04:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
involved in managing and protecting
 
04:05:16.670 --> 04:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
Drinking Water waste water anything of
 
04:05:18.769 --> 04:05:18.779 align:start position:0%
that sort pfas has got to be on their
 
04:05:20.389 --> 04:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
list they need to be paying attention to
 
04:05:23.030 --> 04:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
it we do see it in landfill leachate and
 
04:05:24.530 --> 04:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
that landfill leachate gets
 
04:05:26.809 --> 04:05:26.819 align:start position:0%
traditionally trucked to a Wastewater
 
04:05:28.550 --> 04:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
Plant where it's you know treated and
 
04:05:30.830 --> 04:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
discharged Wastewater plants currently
 
04:05:32.570 --> 04:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
don't really have technology that
 
04:05:35.030 --> 04:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
significantly treats pfas so it's simply
 
04:05:37.370 --> 04:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
abortions at some rate between the
 
04:05:39.769 --> 04:05:39.779 align:start position:0%
residuals the sludge that's created and
 
04:05:41.450 --> 04:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
the discharge to the receiving body
 
04:05:44.929 --> 04:05:44.939 align:start position:0%
there's really we don't the our plants
 
04:05:47.389 --> 04:05:47.399 align:start position:0%
are not capable of destroying pfas in
 
04:05:48.769 --> 04:05:48.779 align:start position:0%
the treatment process so we're looking
 
04:05:50.330 --> 04:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
closely at that that has implications
 
04:05:52.610 --> 04:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
for surface water quality but also for
 
04:05:55.370 --> 04:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
how we manage residuals and biosolids
 
04:05:58.010 --> 04:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
and such and then in drinking water you
 
04:05:59.689 --> 04:05:59.699 align:start position:0%
know if you ask any drinking water
 
04:06:02.389 --> 04:06:02.399 align:start position:0%
operator in the state he knows a lot
 
04:06:04.610 --> 04:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
about pfas because they they have to
 
04:06:07.070 --> 04:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
they've been even if they don't have it
 
04:06:08.750 --> 04:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
above standards they've had to test for
 
04:06:10.189 --> 04:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
it and determine whether it's an issue
 
04:06:12.110 --> 04:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
for them and we're all watching closely
 
04:06:13.969 --> 04:06:13.979 align:start position:0%
to see what EPA is going to do in
 
04:06:16.189 --> 04:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
proposing a new drinking water standard
 
04:06:18.830 --> 04:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
for pfas and this sometime this year we
 
04:06:18.840 --> 04:06:21.050 align:start position:0%
for pfas and this sometime this year we
anticipate

04:06:21.050 --> 04:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
04:06:21.060 --> 04:06:24.229 align:start position:0%
anticipate
follow-up

04:06:24.229 --> 04:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:26.570 --> 04:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
so the standards that you have right now
 
04:06:29.030 --> 04:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
for pfas
 
04:06:31.130 --> 04:06:31.140 align:start position:0%
they're set by the state but that's
 
04:06:31.140 --> 04:06:32.330 align:start position:0%
they're set by the state but that's
correct

04:06:32.330 --> 04:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:06:35.929 --> 04:06:35.939 align:start position:0%
could you explain how you set them do
 
04:06:38.150 --> 04:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
they reflect are they tighter than other
 
04:06:39.830 --> 04:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
states do they come from federal
 
04:06:42.410 --> 04:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
standards I I think it's fair to say
 
04:06:44.510 --> 04:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
that we have some of the most stringent
 
04:06:46.670 --> 04:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
pfas standards for drinking water in in
 
04:06:48.050 --> 04:06:48.060 align:start position:0%
the country there are a number of states
 
04:06:50.030 --> 04:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
that are sort of aligned with us in
 
04:06:51.530 --> 04:06:51.540 align:start position:0%
other states that are really haven't
 
04:06:53.630 --> 04:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
found their way to that yet the way that
 
04:06:55.849 --> 04:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
we set those is we we did work very
 
04:06:58.849 --> 04:06:58.859 align:start position:0%
close we hired a toxicologist uh both an
 
04:07:01.010 --> 04:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
internal one and we had that benefit in
 
04:07:02.929 --> 04:07:02.939 align:start position:0%
the services of an external one as well
 
04:07:05.809 --> 04:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
as long as as well as a team of risk
 
04:07:08.269 --> 04:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
assessors who really dug into the
 
04:07:09.830 --> 04:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
current science and what we knew about
 
04:07:12.349 --> 04:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
it and we believe that we set a very
 
04:07:14.630 --> 04:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
protective and appropriate standard as a
 
04:07:16.070 --> 04:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
result of that process
 
04:07:17.689 --> 04:07:17.699 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
04:07:19.189 --> 04:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
um now that and that was in an
 
04:07:20.929 --> 04:07:20.939 align:start position:0%
environment where EPA had not set any
 
04:07:22.849 --> 04:07:22.859 align:start position:0%
enforceable standards so we were on our
 
04:07:24.590 --> 04:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
own we knew we had a problem we had to
 
04:07:26.570 --> 04:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
develop standards that were appropriate
 
04:07:29.090 --> 04:07:29.100 align:start position:0%
and protective but right now he is kind
 
04:07:30.910 --> 04:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
of catching up and they're working on
 
04:07:33.170 --> 04:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
proposing we expect them sometime the
 
04:07:34.670 --> 04:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
next several months to propose a
 
04:07:36.410 --> 04:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
standard we don't know what that
 
04:07:38.210 --> 04:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
standard will be but it is very possible
 
04:07:40.370 --> 04:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
it will be lower than the standard that
 
04:07:42.530 --> 04:07:42.540 align:start position:0%
we've set so to the extent that that
 
04:07:45.590 --> 04:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
happens if they'll propose a national
 
04:07:48.410 --> 04:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
drinking water MCL and then that won't
 
04:07:49.910 --> 04:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
be effective immediately it'll go
 
04:07:51.769 --> 04:07:51.779 align:start position:0%
through probably a one-year process of
 
04:07:55.070 --> 04:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
finalization but once it's finalized we
 
04:07:56.990 --> 04:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
would be required as a matter of say law
 
04:08:00.110 --> 04:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
to to basically adopt that standard as
 
04:08:02.510 --> 04:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
as the as the drinking water MCL in the
 
04:08:06.170 --> 04:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
state so that's parts per trillion or
 
04:08:08.750 --> 04:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
parts per quadrillion no the the current
 
04:08:10.790 --> 04:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
the right currents thank you for the
 
04:08:12.349 --> 04:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
question that's I believe it not an
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
important one
 
04:08:17.269 --> 04:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
um we we currently regulate um for pfas
 
04:08:18.950 --> 04:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh the two primary ones that most people
 
04:08:22.790 --> 04:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
know about pfoa and pfos are at 12 parts
 
04:08:25.309 --> 04:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
per trillion and 15 parts per trillion
 
04:08:25.319 --> 04:08:26.990 align:start position:0%
per trillion and 15 parts per trillion
respectively

04:08:26.990 --> 04:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
respectively
 
04:08:30.650 --> 04:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
um we uh and you're going down the road
 
04:08:32.570 --> 04:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
the parts per quadrillion issue comes up
 
04:08:36.050 --> 04:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
because EPA has set something that is
 
04:08:37.490 --> 04:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
not intended to be a standard but
 
04:08:39.469 --> 04:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
they've established an interim Health
 
04:08:43.010 --> 04:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
advisory of four parts per quadrillion
 
04:08:45.229 --> 04:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
which is three orders of magnitude lower
 
04:08:46.610 --> 04:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
than where when we were talking about
 
04:08:46.620 --> 04:08:47.710 align:start position:0%
than where when we were talking about
before

04:08:47.710 --> 04:08:47.720 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:08:50.630 --> 04:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
as a potential as a zero risk Health
 
04:08:52.510 --> 04:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
based number
 
04:08:55.610 --> 04:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
they when at the same time we anticipate
 
04:08:57.110 --> 04:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
that at the same time they set the
 
04:08:59.330 --> 04:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
drinking water MCL or they propose a
 
04:09:01.550 --> 04:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
drinking water MCL they will also
 
04:09:04.250 --> 04:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
finalize that Health advisory and we we
 
04:09:06.110 --> 04:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
think it could be we don't know what
 
04:09:07.849 --> 04:09:07.859 align:start position:0%
they're going to do for exactly there's
 
04:09:09.349 --> 04:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of talk around when we really
 
04:09:11.210 --> 04:09:11.220 align:start position:0%
don't know but they could set it in the
 
04:09:13.729 --> 04:09:13.739 align:start position:0%
quadrillion category and it's important
 
04:09:15.950 --> 04:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
to understand that nobody none of the
 
04:09:17.630 --> 04:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
labs in the best Labs who were doing
 
04:09:20.389 --> 04:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
this work on Drinking Water Analysis can
 
04:09:21.950 --> 04:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
get down to parts per quite you know
 
04:09:23.830 --> 04:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
single digit parts per quadrillion
 
04:09:26.870 --> 04:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
detection limits so it's a it's a cons
 
04:09:28.490 --> 04:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
it's a concept but it's not something we
 
04:09:30.130 --> 04:09:30.140 align:start position:0%
can really measure
 
04:09:33.229 --> 04:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Mr chairman
 
04:09:36.769 --> 04:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
um commissioner Scott your Des oversees
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of these very large trust funds
 
04:09:43.309 --> 04:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
how is that money invested is it similar
 
04:09:46.370 --> 04:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
to what the retirement system tries to
 
04:09:50.269 --> 04:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
invest for gain or some other way
 
04:09:51.710 --> 04:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
so now we're going to phone a friend
 
04:09:53.929 --> 04:09:53.939 align:start position:0%
again and talk
 
04:09:57.650 --> 04:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
so so uh I'll let Sue talk to that as as
 
04:09:59.870 --> 04:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
far as uh working with the treasurer's
 
04:09:59.880 --> 04:10:01.670 align:start position:0%
far as uh working with the treasurer's
office

04:10:01.670 --> 04:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
office
 
04:10:04.309 --> 04:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
um yes all of our money is actually
 
04:10:06.050 --> 04:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
invested by the state treasurer's office
 
04:10:06.060 --> 04:10:07.849 align:start position:0%
invested by the state treasurer's office
they

04:10:07.849 --> 04:10:07.859 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:10:09.950 --> 04:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
um under statute have limitations on
 
04:10:13.010 --> 04:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
what they can invest in and we work very
 
04:10:15.410 --> 04:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
closely with them on cash flow analysis
 
04:10:17.630 --> 04:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
and so that they know how much of our
 
04:10:19.910 --> 04:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
funds that they can investor earn
 
04:10:19.920 --> 04:10:22.490 align:start position:0%
funds that they can investor earn
interest

04:10:22.490 --> 04:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:24.889 --> 04:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll ask the treasurer when
 
04:10:26.469 --> 04:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
they're here
 
04:10:29.210 --> 04:10:29.220 align:start position:0%
that the reality of it is we are not
 
04:10:31.550 --> 04:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
nearly as aggressive as the retirement
 
04:10:31.560 --> 04:10:32.630 align:start position:0%
nearly as aggressive as the retirement
system

04:10:32.630 --> 04:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:10:35.630 --> 04:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
because by law the treasurer is bound to
 
04:10:38.929 --> 04:10:38.939 align:start position:0%
limited investment opportunities thank
 
04:10:41.330 --> 04:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
you are you familiar whether do you know
 
04:10:43.490 --> 04:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
whether other states do the same thing
 
04:10:44.809 --> 04:10:44.819 align:start position:0%
or no
 
04:10:46.969 --> 04:10:46.979 align:start position:0%
I am not familiar with that okay thank
 
04:10:49.010 --> 04:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
you Alice the treasury
 
04:10:51.830 --> 04:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions Mr chair I know
 
04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
we're running over but I just wanted to
 
04:10:54.889 --> 04:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
opine a little bit on representative
 
04:10:57.590 --> 04:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
Evil's question on pfas so certainly
 
04:11:00.769 --> 04:11:00.779 align:start position:0%
pfas is a daunting concern Statewide and
 
04:11:03.889 --> 04:11:03.899 align:start position:0%
nationally so two challenges to that and
 
04:11:05.389 --> 04:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
and one I think New Hampshire has
 
04:11:07.670 --> 04:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
positioned themselves very well one is
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
it is such a daunting concern we as you
 
04:11:13.550 --> 04:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
well know we have many competing
 
04:11:15.469 --> 04:11:15.479 align:start position:0%
concerns with contaminants in the
 
04:11:17.510 --> 04:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
environment and what we do so it's it's
 
04:11:19.729 --> 04:11:19.739 align:start position:0%
it's it's a hard hard issue to make sure
 
04:11:21.110 --> 04:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
that one doesn't eclipse the other
 
04:11:22.849 --> 04:11:22.859 align:start position:0%
having said that I think the good news
 
04:11:25.309 --> 04:11:25.319 align:start position:0%
story is New Hampshire has done a lot of
 
04:11:27.530 --> 04:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
testing sampling throughout the state so
 
04:11:31.370 --> 04:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
we we understand the pfas issue uh and
 
04:11:33.229 --> 04:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
now of course nobody anticipated covid
 
04:11:34.490 --> 04:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
and All the Monies that are now
 
04:11:36.290 --> 04:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
happening from the infrastructure Bill
 
04:11:38.929 --> 04:11:38.939 align:start position:0%
and that type of thing but uh New
 
04:11:40.969 --> 04:11:40.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is targeted to receive out of
 
04:11:42.530 --> 04:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
the federal money on the order of about
 
04:11:44.210 --> 04:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars a year for the next
 
04:11:47.150 --> 04:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
five years for uh emerging contaminant
 
04:11:48.469 --> 04:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
funds which doesn't have to be used just
 
04:11:51.530 --> 04:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
for PFS but certainly it can I talked to
 
04:11:53.809 --> 04:11:53.819 align:start position:0%
some of my counterparts in other states
 
04:11:55.610 --> 04:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
and they're talking about using this
 
04:11:55.620 --> 04:11:56.929 align:start position:0%
and they're talking about using this
money

04:11:56.929 --> 04:11:56.939 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:11:59.150 --> 04:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
similar monies that they'll get to do
 
04:12:00.950 --> 04:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
the sampling that we've already done and
 
04:12:02.510 --> 04:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
that I feel that that's kind of
 
04:12:04.610 --> 04:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
unfortunate for them because the money
 
04:12:06.530 --> 04:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
needs to go to solving the problem and
 
04:12:08.750 --> 04:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
remediating and that type of thing and
 
04:12:09.950 --> 04:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
they'll they're totally going to miss
 
04:12:11.990 --> 04:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
the whole that funding cycle which I
 
04:12:13.370 --> 04:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
don't think we'll see again in certainly
 
04:12:15.830 --> 04:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
in my lifetime is they're going to miss
 
04:12:17.750 --> 04:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
all that because they're so far behind
 
04:12:20.210 --> 04:12:20.220 align:start position:0%
the behind the curve so in a backhanded
 
04:12:22.250 --> 04:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
way yes we have a problem we're not the
 
04:12:24.769 --> 04:12:24.779 align:start position:0%
only ones with it and we post ourselves
 
04:12:26.990 --> 04:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
very well to to make good use of the
 
04:12:30.910 --> 04:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:33.530 --> 04:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify one point though
 
04:12:36.710 --> 04:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm trying to link up the
 
04:12:40.610 --> 04:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
how you say the pathway for pfas removal
 
04:12:45.170 --> 04:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
is it true that when the say landfill
 
04:12:47.090 --> 04:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
leachate goes to wastewater treatment
 
04:12:49.490 --> 04:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
plants or whatever goes to wastewater
 
04:12:52.309 --> 04:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
treatment plants they withdraw the pfas
 
04:12:53.689 --> 04:12:53.699 align:start position:0%
and then it ends up back in the
 
04:12:57.290 --> 04:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
landfills or where do the pfas or how
 
04:12:59.389 --> 04:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
does that all work
 
04:13:02.630 --> 04:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
in a hundred words or less if Mike
 
04:13:03.950 --> 04:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
thinks he can do that 100 words or less
 
04:13:06.830 --> 04:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm confident that I can
 
04:13:08.870 --> 04:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
um the the best way to answer that is
 
04:13:10.309 --> 04:13:10.319 align:start position:0%
that when the Wastewater when the
 
04:13:12.530 --> 04:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
leachate containing pfas goes to a
 
04:13:14.210 --> 04:13:14.220 align:start position:0%
Wastewater Plant
 
04:13:16.429 --> 04:13:16.439 align:start position:0%
um it is again apportioned into two
 
04:13:18.469 --> 04:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
places only one is the residuals or the
 
04:13:20.030 --> 04:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
sludge that are generated from the
 
04:13:22.849 --> 04:13:22.859 align:start position:0%
process or it goes out in a diluted
 
04:13:25.010 --> 04:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
fashion to in the discharge to the
 
04:13:26.389 --> 04:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
surface water
 
04:13:27.710 --> 04:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
um depending on the plant depending on
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances that it's not that's not
 
04:13:31.550 --> 04:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
like a we can't say exactly what that
 
04:13:32.870 --> 04:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
number is what the what the percent
 
04:13:35.389 --> 04:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
relative percentages are to the extent
 
04:13:37.429 --> 04:13:37.439 align:start position:0%
that the sludge gets collected and then
 
04:13:40.070 --> 04:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
goes back to a landfill for disposal yes
 
04:13:41.870 --> 04:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's going through a cycle where it
 
04:13:43.189 --> 04:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
came from the landfill and it goes back
 
04:13:45.050 --> 04:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
to the landfill but not all of it
 
04:13:46.729 --> 04:13:46.739 align:start position:0%
because some of it will go out in
 
04:13:49.309 --> 04:13:49.319 align:start position:0%
discharge surface water discharges to
 
04:13:50.570 --> 04:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
surface water
 
04:13:50.580 --> 04:13:53.050 align:start position:0%
surface water
thanks

04:13:53.050 --> 04:13:53.060 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
04:13:55.010 --> 04:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
there's a hundred there's probably more
 
04:13:55.020 --> 04:13:57.650 align:start position:0%
there's a hundred there's probably more
but

04:13:57.650 --> 04:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:59.929 --> 04:13:59.939 align:start position:0%
speed of a hundred
 
04:14:01.790 --> 04:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions thank you
 
04:14:03.769 --> 04:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
commissioner and your staff Mike good to
 
04:14:06.349 --> 04:14:06.359 align:start position:0%
see you as always and the rest of you
 
04:14:08.210 --> 04:14:08.220 align:start position:0%
folks thanks for your good work we'll
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
see you in the next couple of weeks with
 
04:14:18.830 --> 04:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:21.410 --> 04:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
we'll just take a very short break so
 
04:14:23.450 --> 04:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office can come
 
04:14:25.550 --> 04:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
in and get set up
 
04:15:41.570 --> 04:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:44.689 --> 04:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
well good to see you Mr secretary and uh
 
04:15:46.849 --> 04:15:46.859 align:start position:0%
some former members of the finance
 
04:15:49.670 --> 04:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
committee uh
 
04:15:51.650 --> 04:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
and you're all welcome to come forward
 
04:15:57.889 --> 04:15:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:59.929 --> 04:15:59.939 align:start position:0%
so for those of you don't know Aaron
 
04:16:01.309 --> 04:16:01.319 align:start position:0%
Hennessey served in the finance
 
04:16:03.469 --> 04:16:03.479 align:start position:0%
committee and then left us went to the
 
04:16:05.870 --> 04:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
Senate and now she's with the secretary
 
04:16:08.870 --> 04:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
and Patty Lovejoy served as chair of
 
04:16:10.849 --> 04:16:10.859 align:start position:0%
this division at one time and was on the
 
04:16:12.650 --> 04:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
finance committee for a couple of terms
 
04:16:14.570 --> 04:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
so we have some good friends and Dave
 
04:16:18.110 --> 04:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
also we know David well so thanks Mr
 
04:16:18.120 --> 04:16:21.590 align:start position:0%
also we know David well so thanks Mr
secretary

04:16:21.590 --> 04:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:25.250 --> 04:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
you know let's just jump right in okay
 
04:16:27.050 --> 04:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
04:16:27.060 --> 04:16:28.010 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
committee

04:16:28.010 --> 04:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:16:30.650 --> 04:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
uh we're here to give a presentation on
 
04:16:33.950 --> 04:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
the department of of State
 
04:16:33.960 --> 04:16:36.110 align:start position:0%
the department of of State
um

04:16:36.110 --> 04:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:38.330 --> 04:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
I'll just start off by saying that we
 
04:16:41.990 --> 04:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
are a state agency nowhere near the size
 
04:16:45.349 --> 04:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services but uh
 
04:16:47.809 --> 04:16:47.819 align:start position:0%
but we do play an important role
 
04:16:47.819 --> 04:16:48.769 align:start position:0%
but we do play an important role
um

04:16:48.769 --> 04:16:48.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:52.070 --> 04:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
and among the uh the things that we do
 
04:16:53.450 --> 04:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
start off with the administrative
 
04:16:55.429 --> 04:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
offices which is which are on the second
 
04:16:57.889 --> 04:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
floor of the State House
 
04:17:00.229 --> 04:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh an area hopefully that all of you are
 
04:17:02.269 --> 04:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
familiar with but if you're not uh you
 
04:17:04.070 --> 04:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
know just our door is always open stop
 
04:17:04.080 --> 04:17:05.150 align:start position:0%
know just our door is always open stop
in

04:17:05.150 --> 04:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:17:07.130 --> 04:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
candy jars are usually pretty full so
 
04:17:10.189 --> 04:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
that's handy on session days and uh you
 
04:17:11.450 --> 04:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
know just out come in and help yourself
 
04:17:15.229 --> 04:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
but you know in that in that uh
 
04:17:19.330 --> 04:17:19.340 align:start position:0%
space we receive a lot of the statutory
 
04:17:21.410 --> 04:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
required filings
 
04:17:25.790 --> 04:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
from legislators members of the public
 
04:17:28.910 --> 04:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioners from executive departments
 
04:17:28.920 --> 04:17:30.610 align:start position:0%
Commissioners from executive departments
we

04:17:30.610 --> 04:17:30.620 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:17:33.469 --> 04:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
issue a post deals which are
 
04:17:37.070 --> 04:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
certifications of notary
 
04:17:41.269 --> 04:17:41.279 align:start position:0%
signatures typically used for uh
 
04:17:44.030 --> 04:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
foreign transactions and most commonly
 
04:17:48.889 --> 04:17:48.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:48.899 --> 04:17:50.809 align:start position:0%
 
we

04:17:50.809 --> 04:17:50.819 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:17:53.570 --> 04:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
handle all of the commissions that are
 
04:17:54.769 --> 04:17:54.779 align:start position:0%
approved by the government Council
 
04:17:56.410 --> 04:17:56.420 align:start position:0%
related to
 
04:18:00.170 --> 04:18:00.180 align:start position:0%
notary publics and justices of the peace
 
04:18:02.030 --> 04:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
and there are
 
04:18:04.189 --> 04:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
typically five thousand or so of those
 
04:18:07.670 --> 04:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
that are issued per year and uh
 
04:18:09.469 --> 04:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
Aaron knows that very well because she
 
04:18:12.769 --> 04:18:12.779 align:start position:0%
has to sign every one of those so
 
04:18:12.779 --> 04:18:14.030 align:start position:0%
has to sign every one of those so
um

04:18:14.030 --> 04:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:17.630 --> 04:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
the uh we also uh
 
04:18:19.610 --> 04:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
cater to the governed Council so
 
04:18:21.110 --> 04:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
whenever they have a government council
 
04:18:23.929 --> 04:18:23.939 align:start position:0%
meeting a member of my staff is sitting
 
04:18:27.170 --> 04:18:27.180 align:start position:0%
at the table keeping the minutes and and
 
04:18:29.150 --> 04:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
the governor in line so
 
04:18:29.160 --> 04:18:32.050 align:start position:0%
the governor in line so
um

04:18:32.050 --> 04:18:32.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:35.630 --> 04:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
and so we we prepare the agendas for the
 
04:18:38.389 --> 04:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
council the government Council submitted
 
04:18:41.570 --> 04:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
by all of the agencies in the state
 
04:18:44.630 --> 04:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
and we keep the minutes and afterwards
 
04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
those minutes are put up online so that
 
04:18:49.490 --> 04:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
the General Public
 
04:18:51.769 --> 04:18:51.779 align:start position:0%
can hear what what happened at the
 
04:18:51.779 --> 04:18:53.929 align:start position:0%
can hear what what happened at the
meetings

04:18:53.929 --> 04:18:53.939 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
04:18:56.750 --> 04:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
we also have a corporations Division and
 
04:18:58.610 --> 04:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Securities housed in the
 
04:19:00.290 --> 04:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
Annex Building and I think all of you
 
04:19:02.330 --> 04:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
know where that is
 
04:19:04.670 --> 04:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
on the second floor
 
04:19:06.769 --> 04:19:06.779 align:start position:0%
corporations of course registers all
 
04:19:08.710 --> 04:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
business entities that
 
04:19:11.570 --> 04:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
that are operating in the state of New
 
04:19:11.580 --> 04:19:12.590 align:start position:0%
that are operating in the state of New
Hampshire

04:19:12.590 --> 04:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:19:16.130 --> 04:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
and the Bureau of Securities registers
 
04:19:19.250 --> 04:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
dealer Brokers and those individuals
 
04:19:22.189 --> 04:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
that deal with financial instruments uh
 
04:19:24.050 --> 04:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
and and the General Public
 
04:19:26.389 --> 04:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
so they are a the Securities is
 
04:19:28.849 --> 04:19:28.859 align:start position:0%
certainly the largest revenue Source in
 
04:19:31.729 --> 04:19:31.739 align:start position:0%
our office they raise in excess of 40
 
04:19:33.469 --> 04:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year through
 
04:19:36.050 --> 04:19:36.060 align:start position:0%
registration fees that go directly to
 
04:19:37.610 --> 04:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
the general fund
 
04:19:39.830 --> 04:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
Securities interestingly enough is
 
04:19:42.469 --> 04:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
funded by the fines that they collect
 
04:19:44.590 --> 04:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
through their enforcement actions
 
04:19:47.990 --> 04:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
and uh in recent years they've had no
 
04:19:50.330 --> 04:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
problem with the funds that they need to
 
04:19:53.330 --> 04:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
operate so I think they're doing a good
 
04:19:56.689 --> 04:19:56.699 align:start position:0%
job and certainly uh improving over
 
04:19:56.699 --> 04:19:58.610 align:start position:0%
job and certainly uh improving over
there

04:19:58.610 --> 04:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:20:01.370 --> 04:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
and then we have the archives building
 
04:20:03.650 --> 04:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
which is up on the state hospital
 
04:20:03.660 --> 04:20:05.450 align:start position:0%
which is up on the state hospital
grounds

04:20:05.450 --> 04:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
grounds
 
04:20:05.460 --> 04:20:06.530 align:start position:0%
grounds
um

04:20:06.530 --> 04:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:09.410 --> 04:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
and in that building we have the
 
04:20:12.050 --> 04:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
division of Vital Records which collects
 
04:20:14.809 --> 04:20:14.819 align:start position:0%
information on births deaths marriages
 
04:20:17.410 --> 04:20:17.420 align:start position:0%
divorces and things like that
 
04:20:21.110 --> 04:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:23.269 --> 04:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
they they take in the information they
 
04:20:26.150 --> 04:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
put it in the appropriate databases and
 
04:20:28.250 --> 04:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
that information then is available to
 
04:20:30.429 --> 04:20:30.439 align:start position:0%
agencies like Health and Human Services
 
04:20:33.769 --> 04:20:33.779 align:start position:0%
that need the information to track uh
 
04:20:36.110 --> 04:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases and things like
 
04:20:36.120 --> 04:20:36.889 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases and things like
that

04:20:36.889 --> 04:20:36.899 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:20:40.370 --> 04:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
they also share information with the
 
04:20:42.290 --> 04:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
Center for Disease Control in Washington
 
04:20:42.300 --> 04:20:44.330 align:start position:0%
Center for Disease Control in Washington
and

04:20:44.330 --> 04:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:44.340 --> 04:20:45.050 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:20:45.050 --> 04:20:45.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:47.389 --> 04:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
they have a big responsibility to keep
 
04:20:50.210 --> 04:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
that information the specific individual
 
04:20:52.570 --> 04:20:52.580 align:start position:0%
information on the
 
04:20:54.830 --> 04:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
on the individual private and
 
04:20:56.689 --> 04:20:56.699 align:start position:0%
confidential and they've been doing a
 
04:20:59.689 --> 04:20:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:02.570 --> 04:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
also in the building we have state
 
04:21:05.450 --> 04:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
archives which houses some of the most
 
04:21:08.150 --> 04:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
precious historical documents that the
 
04:21:09.469 --> 04:21:09.479 align:start position:0%
state has
 
04:21:11.450 --> 04:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
um probably the most famous document is
 
04:21:13.790 --> 04:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
the ratification document where New
 
04:21:15.889 --> 04:21:15.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was the ninth state to ratify
 
04:21:18.110 --> 04:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
the United States Constitution
 
04:21:19.729 --> 04:21:19.739 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:21:22.309 --> 04:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
the copy that we have is better than the
 
04:21:24.830 --> 04:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
one that is on display in Washington D.C
 
04:21:27.650 --> 04:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
at the National Archives
 
04:21:31.070 --> 04:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh we would like to put it on display
 
04:21:35.090 --> 04:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
more but we realized or the archivists
 
04:21:37.189 --> 04:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
Frank mavers when he was the state
 
04:21:39.110 --> 04:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
archivist noticed that there was a
 
04:21:42.530 --> 04:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
deterioration in the ink on the
 
04:21:46.010 --> 04:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
parchment uh while it was on display so
 
04:21:49.130 --> 04:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
it's obvious that for us to display that
 
04:21:52.550 --> 04:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
document publicly for long periods of
 
04:21:55.969 --> 04:21:55.979 align:start position:0%
time that it needs to be in a in an
 
04:21:58.370 --> 04:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
environment that would be protected from
 
04:21:59.530 --> 04:21:59.540 align:start position:0%
some light
 
04:22:04.550 --> 04:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh and secure keep it from being stolen
 
04:22:06.830 --> 04:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
um and there could be significant costs
 
04:22:08.990 --> 04:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
involved with that but if this committee
 
04:22:10.490 --> 04:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
is interested in coming up and viewing
 
04:22:11.870 --> 04:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
it you know we're happy to make it
 
04:22:14.330 --> 04:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
available for short periods of time so
 
04:22:17.150 --> 04:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
that you can actually see a really
 
04:22:19.070 --> 04:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
important and fascinating piece of
 
04:22:19.080 --> 04:22:20.210 align:start position:0%
important and fascinating piece of
History

04:22:20.210 --> 04:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
History
 
04:22:20.220 --> 04:22:21.229 align:start position:0%
History
um

04:22:21.229 --> 04:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:23.210 --> 04:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
other documents up there civil war
 
04:22:23.220 --> 04:22:25.210 align:start position:0%
other documents up there civil war
records

04:22:25.210 --> 04:22:25.220 align:start position:0%
records
 
04:22:28.729 --> 04:22:28.739 align:start position:0%
revolutionary war records we have I
 
04:22:30.650 --> 04:22:30.660 align:start position:0%
think the oldest record in the archives
 
04:22:34.490 --> 04:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
dates back to I think 16 30 somewhere in
 
04:22:36.950 --> 04:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
that vicinity
 
04:22:36.960 --> 04:22:37.849 align:start position:0%
that vicinity
um

04:22:37.849 --> 04:22:37.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:41.809 --> 04:22:41.819 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot that you know we have
 
04:22:44.750 --> 04:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
to work with there and then the records
 
04:22:47.389 --> 04:22:47.399 align:start position:0%
management part of the archives is
 
04:22:50.750 --> 04:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
the the vast Stacks that we have up
 
04:22:53.630 --> 04:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
there to house paper copies of
 
04:22:55.670 --> 04:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
correspondence and and just paper
 
04:23:00.410 --> 04:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
records that agencies no longer need on
 
04:23:03.769 --> 04:23:03.779 align:start position:0%
a daily basis but they haven't quite met
 
04:23:05.809 --> 04:23:05.819 align:start position:0%
the retention period for being able to
 
04:23:08.469 --> 04:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
destroy those records and so
 
04:23:11.150 --> 04:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
we will keep those records if the agency
 
04:23:13.250 --> 04:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
needs them for whatever reason they send
 
04:23:14.450 --> 04:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
a request
 
04:23:17.330 --> 04:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
uh we'll retrieve the information get it
 
04:23:19.250 --> 04:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
to them pick it up when they're done and
 
04:23:20.510 --> 04:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
refile it
 
04:23:23.269 --> 04:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
and then when the retention schedule is
 
04:23:26.330 --> 04:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
up on those documents we notify the
 
04:23:26.340 --> 04:23:27.410 align:start position:0%
up on those documents we notify the
agency

04:23:27.410 --> 04:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
agency
 
04:23:29.689 --> 04:23:29.699 align:start position:0%
ask for their permission to destroy the
 
04:23:32.750 --> 04:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
records and upon that approval uh we
 
04:23:35.570 --> 04:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
will we will do that
 
04:23:35.580 --> 04:23:37.010 align:start position:0%
will we will do that
uh

04:23:37.010 --> 04:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:23:39.950 --> 04:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
through some last budget activity we
 
04:23:43.010 --> 04:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
were able to create a digitization
 
04:23:46.849 --> 04:23:46.859 align:start position:0%
center in the archives which has some
 
04:23:50.030 --> 04:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art equipment in there and
 
04:23:52.429 --> 04:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
we're gearing up now to
 
04:23:52.439 --> 04:23:53.090 align:start position:0%
we're gearing up now to
um

04:23:53.090 --> 04:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:55.729 --> 04:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
use that to digitize a lot of those
 
04:23:57.650 --> 04:23:57.660 align:start position:0%
important collections historical
 
04:23:59.389 --> 04:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
collections that we have
 
04:24:01.490 --> 04:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
but it can also be used as a resource
 
04:24:03.290 --> 04:24:03.300 align:start position:0%
for smaller State agencies that want to
 
04:24:05.630 --> 04:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
start digitizing their records to be
 
04:24:07.929 --> 04:24:07.939 align:start position:0%
able to do that
 
04:24:11.830 --> 04:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I think we're very excited that
 
04:24:15.229 --> 04:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
we have found a replacement for the
 
04:24:18.610 --> 04:24:18.620 align:start position:0%
recently retired archivist Brian Burford
 
04:24:21.610 --> 04:24:21.620 align:start position:0%
who is a young
 
04:24:25.550 --> 04:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh a graduate dual dual Masters in
 
04:24:28.670 --> 04:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
history and archives management that has
 
04:24:31.070 --> 04:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
experience with archival work here in
 
04:24:34.969 --> 04:24:34.979 align:start position:0%
Concord and very enthusiastic individual
 
04:24:37.969 --> 04:24:37.979 align:start position:0%
that has a lot of experience with the
 
04:24:40.969 --> 04:24:40.979 align:start position:0%
digitization and archives and so I think
 
04:24:42.590 --> 04:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a huge asset for the
 
04:24:44.030 --> 04:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
department and the state of New
 
04:24:46.130 --> 04:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when we can get those records
 
04:24:46.140 --> 04:24:47.990 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when we can get those records
online

04:24:47.990 --> 04:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
online
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
um you know for the general public to be
 
04:24:53.760 --> 04:24:53.770 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:53.770 --> 04:24:54.290 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:24:54.290 --> 04:24:54.300 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:24:54.300 --> 04:24:55.790 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:24:55.790 --> 04:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:58.309 --> 04:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
and then that brings us to the elections
 
04:25:00.710 --> 04:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
division which is the most exciting part
 
04:25:03.229 --> 04:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
of the office
 
04:25:05.510 --> 04:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
it seems like we're always working in
 
04:25:09.349 --> 04:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
election mode in one way or another
 
04:25:09.359 --> 04:25:10.790 align:start position:0%
election mode in one way or another
um

04:25:10.790 --> 04:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:13.729 --> 04:25:13.739 align:start position:0%
and it is probably the area that is
 
04:25:16.130 --> 04:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
going to see the most action before this
 
04:25:19.670 --> 04:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
committee coming up
 
04:25:22.070 --> 04:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:25:25.490 --> 04:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
the elections office houses what we call
 
04:25:28.729 --> 04:25:28.739 align:start position:0%
the help America vote act office
 
04:25:32.990 --> 04:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
and that's an office that is funded by
 
04:25:35.210 --> 04:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
the help America vote act which passed
 
04:25:36.670 --> 04:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
Congress in
 
04:25:40.670 --> 04:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
2002 uh when the Act passed it required
 
04:25:43.309 --> 04:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
that the state do five things number one
 
04:25:46.189 --> 04:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
create a Statewide centralized voter
 
04:25:46.199 --> 04:25:47.269 align:start position:0%
create a Statewide centralized voter
database

04:25:47.269 --> 04:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
database
 
04:25:49.429 --> 04:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
which at the time
 
04:25:52.010 --> 04:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
we did not have every community in New
 
04:25:53.630 --> 04:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire had their own
 
04:25:57.110 --> 04:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
checklist of Voters some of it was kept
 
04:25:58.849 --> 04:25:58.859 align:start position:0%
on paper and every time they redid the
 
04:26:00.530 --> 04:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
checklist they wrote you know the whole
 
04:26:01.849 --> 04:26:01.859 align:start position:0%
thing over again
 
04:26:04.429 --> 04:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
and the cities had you know were more
 
04:26:06.170 --> 04:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
advanced at the time and had
 
04:26:09.849 --> 04:26:09.859 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets and uh computerized
 
04:26:12.769 --> 04:26:12.779 align:start position:0%
checklists but we had to take all of
 
04:26:16.729 --> 04:26:16.739 align:start position:0%
that information and and uh make it
 
04:26:18.710 --> 04:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
uniform so that we could enter it into
 
04:26:22.070 --> 04:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
the database we're currently working on
 
04:26:24.950 --> 04:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
the next generation of uh we're
 
04:26:27.710 --> 04:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
replacing the Legacy database that we
 
04:26:30.769 --> 04:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
created that was that went into effect
 
04:26:34.130 --> 04:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
in 2006 and we expect a new one to go
 
04:26:35.889 --> 04:26:35.899 align:start position:0%
live this summer
 
04:26:39.710 --> 04:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
with a lot more functionality so I
 
04:26:41.750 --> 04:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
expect that you know the supervisors of
 
04:26:43.969 --> 04:26:43.979 align:start position:0%
the checklist and the town clerks are
 
04:26:47.210 --> 04:26:47.220 align:start position:0%
going to see advantages to uh what we've
 
04:26:47.220 --> 04:26:49.490 align:start position:0%
going to see advantages to uh what we've
created

04:26:49.490 --> 04:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
created
 
04:26:51.110 --> 04:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
the other one of the other things we had
 
04:26:52.330 --> 04:26:52.340 align:start position:0%
to do was
 
04:26:54.590 --> 04:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
have accessible voting equipment
 
04:26:57.649 --> 04:26:57.659 align:start position:0%
available in every polling place so that
 
04:26:59.929 --> 04:26:59.939 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities to the
 
04:27:02.630 --> 04:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
extent possible would be able to vote
 
04:27:05.990 --> 04:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
independently and privately and you know
 
04:27:08.269 --> 04:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
I believe we're on our third generation
 
04:27:11.330 --> 04:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
of equipment to allow that to happen and
 
04:27:13.670 --> 04:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
if you go into your polling place you'll
 
04:27:15.830 --> 04:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
see a white tent that's set up and
 
04:27:19.250 --> 04:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
inside the tent is a printer and a
 
04:27:19.260 --> 04:27:20.210 align:start position:0%
inside the tent is a printer and a
tablet

04:27:20.210 --> 04:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
tablet
 
04:27:22.790 --> 04:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
the the voter is able to make their
 
04:27:25.550 --> 04:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
choices on the tablet and then when
 
04:27:27.769 --> 04:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
they're ready they push the button and
 
04:27:30.110 --> 04:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
an actual official ballot is placed in
 
04:27:32.269 --> 04:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
the printer it goes through the printer
 
04:27:35.030 --> 04:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
the printer places the marks on the
 
04:27:36.769 --> 04:27:36.779 align:start position:0%
choices of the voter
 
04:27:38.570 --> 04:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
and then the voter can take that and
 
04:27:40.010 --> 04:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
actually run it through the ballot
 
04:27:41.389 --> 04:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
counting device just like any other
 
04:27:44.750 --> 04:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
voter in the polling place does so we've
 
04:27:47.030 --> 04:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
come a long way in that regard
 
04:27:50.269 --> 04:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
the um in the last election we had
 
04:27:52.189 --> 04:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
available for the first time
 
04:27:52.199 --> 04:27:53.689 align:start position:0%
available for the first time
uh

04:27:53.689 --> 04:27:53.699 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:27:57.530 --> 04:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
a a an opportunity for voters with site
 
04:27:59.510 --> 04:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities to be able to receive their
 
04:28:02.030 --> 04:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
ballot electronically at home
 
04:28:04.550 --> 04:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
and uh in the same manner as the
 
04:28:06.349 --> 04:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
accessible voting print their ballot off
 
04:28:09.050 --> 04:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
with a marks on it but they would mail
 
04:28:11.630 --> 04:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
it into the back into the town clerk in
 
04:28:15.170 --> 04:28:15.180 align:start position:0%
the same way any absentee voter would so
 
04:28:18.229 --> 04:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh you know we improved that process
 
04:28:22.429 --> 04:28:22.439 align:start position:0%
our website went through a major
 
04:28:22.439 --> 04:28:24.050 align:start position:0%
our website went through a major
overhaul

04:28:24.050 --> 04:28:24.060 align:start position:0%
overhaul
 
04:28:26.630 --> 04:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
which improves the functionality of it I
 
04:28:28.070 --> 04:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
think tremendously and we're still
 
04:28:30.469 --> 04:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
working on making it even better
 
04:28:31.969 --> 04:28:31.979 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that we did in
 
04:28:36.769 --> 04:28:36.779 align:start position:0%
that process was make the website uh Ada
 
04:28:39.349 --> 04:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
accessible so that voters again with
 
04:28:41.689 --> 04:28:41.699 align:start position:0%
site disabilities can pull up the
 
04:28:43.849 --> 04:28:43.859 align:start position:0%
website put their cursor anywhere on the
 
04:28:46.849 --> 04:28:46.859 align:start position:0%
screen and and have read to them what is
 
04:28:49.309 --> 04:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
being displayed so
 
04:28:56.389 --> 04:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:59.689 --> 04:28:59.699 align:start position:0%
and then we have a number of initiatives
 
04:29:01.849 --> 04:29:01.859 align:start position:0%
that are ongoing
 
04:29:04.490 --> 04:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
first of all you know with uh as you all
 
04:29:07.670 --> 04:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
know secretary Gardner retired uh a year
 
04:29:07.680 --> 04:29:08.630 align:start position:0%
know secretary Gardner retired uh a year
ago

04:29:08.630 --> 04:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
ago
 
04:29:14.929 --> 04:29:14.939 align:start position:0%
and uh when he left after 45 years we've
 
04:29:16.929 --> 04:29:16.939 align:start position:0%
been aggressively you know going through
 
04:29:21.050 --> 04:29:21.060 align:start position:0%
the department and just assessing things
 
04:29:23.929 --> 04:29:23.939 align:start position:0%
and and making I think some pretty
 
04:29:27.050 --> 04:29:27.060 align:start position:0%
aggressive uh improvements most of it in
 
04:29:28.790 --> 04:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
the area of Technology
 
04:29:28.800 --> 04:29:31.130 align:start position:0%
the area of Technology
we

04:29:31.130 --> 04:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:29:34.849 --> 04:29:34.859 align:start position:0%
had a situation where we had inherited a
 
04:29:38.210 --> 04:29:38.220 align:start position:0%
vendor that was maintaining the computer
 
04:29:38.220 --> 04:29:41.269 align:start position:0%
vendor that was maintaining the computer
systems

04:29:41.269 --> 04:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:44.630 --> 04:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
the the vendor purchased the company
 
04:29:47.149 --> 04:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
from the former vendor and the new
 
04:29:49.490 --> 04:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
company that we ended up with was just
 
04:29:49.500 --> 04:29:50.870 align:start position:0%
company that we ended up with was just
incompetent

04:29:50.870 --> 04:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
incompetent
 
04:29:52.790 --> 04:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
and it caused since all kinds of
 
04:29:56.210 --> 04:29:56.220 align:start position:0%
problems uh you know they weren't they
 
04:29:58.610 --> 04:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
weren't keeping things maintained when
 
04:29:59.929 --> 04:29:59.939 align:start position:0%
we had issues whether it was in
 
04:30:03.050 --> 04:30:03.060 align:start position:0%
corporations or with the Statewide voter
 
04:30:05.510 --> 04:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
registration database they were very
 
04:30:07.910 --> 04:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
slow to fix it they clearly didn't have
 
04:30:10.969 --> 04:30:10.979 align:start position:0%
the staff on hand to handle the needs of
 
04:30:13.550 --> 04:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire other states that had the
 
04:30:14.870 --> 04:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
same company were having the same
 
04:30:17.630 --> 04:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
problems so I'm happy to say that for
 
04:30:19.610 --> 04:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
the most part we're completely out from
 
04:30:23.570 --> 04:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
under that company now corporations the
 
04:30:26.269 --> 04:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
corporation's quick start system where
 
04:30:28.309 --> 04:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
agencies can honor get on and register
 
04:30:31.750 --> 04:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
businesses pay their annual filing fees
 
04:30:35.530 --> 04:30:35.540 align:start position:0%
is working better than it ever has been
 
04:30:39.490 --> 04:30:39.500 align:start position:0%
and it allows us to look at Innovative
 
04:30:42.889 --> 04:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
additions to that process which we are
 
04:30:42.899 --> 04:30:43.969 align:start position:0%
additions to that process which we are
doing

04:30:43.969 --> 04:30:43.979 align:start position:0%
doing
 
04:30:48.410 --> 04:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:50.330 --> 04:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the next generation of
 
04:30:52.309 --> 04:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
ballot counting devices because the
 
04:30:55.790 --> 04:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
accuvote machine is rapidly reaching the
 
04:30:59.349 --> 04:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
end of its useful lifespan and so we are
 
04:31:05.090 --> 04:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
testing new models in real elections we
 
04:31:07.370 --> 04:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
tested a device with open source
 
04:31:10.790 --> 04:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
software during the general election and
 
04:31:12.349 --> 04:31:12.359 align:start position:0%
we're testing three different devices
 
04:31:15.830 --> 04:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
that have proprietary software for the
 
04:31:18.590 --> 04:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
March town meeting and the towns of
 
04:31:22.429 --> 04:31:22.439 align:start position:0%
Winchester Milford Londonderry and
 
04:31:22.439 --> 04:31:23.689 align:start position:0%
Winchester Milford Londonderry and
Ashland

04:31:23.689 --> 04:31:23.699 align:start position:0%
Ashland
 
04:31:26.929 --> 04:31:26.939 align:start position:0%
and so hopefully we'll have good
 
04:31:29.570 --> 04:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
experiences there and I think within the
 
04:31:30.889 --> 04:31:30.899 align:start position:0%
next year or so the ballot law
 
04:31:32.630 --> 04:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
commission should reach the point where
 
04:31:35.929 --> 04:31:35.939 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to decide which device
 
04:31:39.010 --> 04:31:39.020 align:start position:0%
they want to approve moving forward
 
04:31:41.870 --> 04:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
the newer technology has what's called
 
04:31:44.870 --> 04:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
digital scan technology which means that
 
04:31:46.729 --> 04:31:46.739 align:start position:0%
when the ballots are being fed through
 
04:31:48.130 --> 04:31:48.140 align:start position:0%
the device
 
04:31:51.530 --> 04:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
there is a a digital recording of every
 
04:31:53.769 --> 04:31:53.779 align:start position:0%
ballot both sides of the of the paper
 
04:31:56.510 --> 04:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
and so the ballot the image of the
 
04:31:58.309 --> 04:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
ballast can be pulled up later which
 
04:32:01.490 --> 04:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
could be really helpful in audits that
 
04:32:05.570 --> 04:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh you know will excuse me are important
 
04:32:08.330 --> 04:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
to giving voters confidence in
 
04:32:13.429 --> 04:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:16.370 --> 04:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
the use of electronic poll books is
 
04:32:19.610 --> 04:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
expanding uh not as fast as I would like
 
04:32:22.670 --> 04:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
to see it but we have 16 polling places
 
04:32:25.309 --> 04:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
now that are using those devices and
 
04:32:28.010 --> 04:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
that represents approximately 150 000
 
04:32:31.309 --> 04:32:31.319 align:start position:0%
voters in the state so each each
 
04:32:32.870 --> 04:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
election there's more and more of that
 
04:32:34.429 --> 04:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
going on
 
04:32:38.090 --> 04:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
we've expanded the training that we put
 
04:32:41.269 --> 04:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
on for poll workers not only do we
 
04:32:43.070 --> 04:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
travel around every county in the state
 
04:32:46.550 --> 04:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
multiple times in an election cycle but
 
04:32:48.649 --> 04:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
we're putting the trainings up online so
 
04:32:51.229 --> 04:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
that if election officials are not able
 
04:32:53.630 --> 04:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
to attend an in-person training they're
 
04:32:55.870 --> 04:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
able to pull it up online and watch it
 
04:33:01.250 --> 04:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:01.260 --> 04:33:03.290 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:33:03.290 --> 04:33:03.300 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:33:05.990 --> 04:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
we've done a lot more too with voter
 
04:33:08.570 --> 04:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
education and we're utilizing we've
 
04:33:10.970 --> 04:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
hired a communications director in the
 
04:33:13.131 --> 04:33:13.141 align:start position:0%
process which is a role that I think
 
04:33:16.131 --> 04:33:16.141 align:start position:0%
would need it for a long time and that
 
04:33:18.289 --> 04:33:18.299 align:start position:0%
individual has been putting up a lot of
 
04:33:20.810 --> 04:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
election related information on social
 
04:33:20.820 --> 04:33:21.910 align:start position:0%
election related information on social
media

04:33:21.910 --> 04:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
media
 
04:33:24.490 --> 04:33:24.500 align:start position:0%
mostly to just inform voters about
 
04:33:27.650 --> 04:33:27.660 align:start position:0%
procedures in the polling place and to
 
04:33:29.750 --> 04:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
encourage them to turn out and vote
 
04:33:33.170 --> 04:33:33.180 align:start position:0%
we also use traditional media and we're
 
04:33:35.090 --> 04:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
doing we have been doing a lot more with
 
04:33:36.650 --> 04:33:36.660 align:start position:0%
speaking engagements and meeting with
 
04:33:36.660 --> 04:33:37.910 align:start position:0%
speaking engagements and meeting with
groups

04:33:37.910 --> 04:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
groups
 
04:33:40.250 --> 04:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
that are out there
 
04:33:40.260 --> 04:33:41.150 align:start position:0%
that are out there
um

04:33:41.150 --> 04:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:44.869 --> 04:33:44.879 align:start position:0%
we have done for the first time
 
04:33:44.879 --> 04:33:46.209 align:start position:0%
we have done for the first time
uh

04:33:46.209 --> 04:33:46.219 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:48.410 --> 04:33:48.420 align:start position:0%
we've been working on some initiatives
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
with putting information out there in
 
04:33:54.709 --> 04:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
foreign languages to you know the
 
04:33:58.131 --> 04:33:58.141 align:start position:0%
communities in New Hampshire that don't
 
04:34:00.349 --> 04:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
speak English as a foreign language and
 
04:34:02.390 --> 04:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
we have populations of those individuals
 
04:34:05.449 --> 04:34:05.459 align:start position:0%
that are growing So based on census
 
04:34:05.459 --> 04:34:06.250 align:start position:0%
that are growing So based on census
information

04:34:06.250 --> 04:34:06.260 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:34:09.289 --> 04:34:09.299 align:start position:0%
which we chose Spanish French and
 
04:34:12.890 --> 04:34:12.900 align:start position:0%
Mandarin Chinese which in the last
 
04:34:12.900 --> 04:34:13.970 align:start position:0%
Mandarin Chinese which in the last
census

04:34:13.970 --> 04:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
census
 
04:34:16.849 --> 04:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
seem to be the three most highly spoken
 
04:34:18.650 --> 04:34:18.660 align:start position:0%
languages in New Hampshire other than
 
04:34:18.660 --> 04:34:19.730 align:start position:0%
languages in New Hampshire other than
English

04:34:19.730 --> 04:34:19.740 align:start position:0%
English
 
04:34:21.890 --> 04:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
and not only have we published some
 
04:34:24.470 --> 04:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
election related information in those
 
04:34:24.480 --> 04:34:26.209 align:start position:0%
election related information in those
languages

04:34:26.209 --> 04:34:26.219 align:start position:0%
languages
 
04:34:28.730 --> 04:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
we have an initiative in the Securities
 
04:34:31.789 --> 04:34:31.799 align:start position:0%
division where we're devoting a lot more
 
04:34:34.689 --> 04:34:34.699 align:start position:0%
time and resources to investor education
 
04:34:38.150 --> 04:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
and we actually have a program on
 
04:34:38.160 --> 04:34:39.650 align:start position:0%
and we actually have a program on
investor

04:34:39.650 --> 04:34:39.660 align:start position:0%
investor
 
04:34:41.929 --> 04:34:41.939 align:start position:0%
financial literacy
 
04:34:44.269 --> 04:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
where we're trying to reach out to you
 
04:34:45.650 --> 04:34:45.660 align:start position:0%
know individuals that may have money to
 
04:34:47.810 --> 04:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
invest or that they want to save for
 
04:34:50.570 --> 04:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
their children's college education
 
04:34:53.269 --> 04:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
to know the basic language and
 
04:34:55.970 --> 04:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
principles in investing and also more
 
04:34:58.310 --> 04:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
importantly how to avoid scams with the
 
04:35:01.490 --> 04:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
money that they want to invest and not
 
04:35:03.230 --> 04:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
only did we publish that guide in
 
04:35:05.990 --> 04:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
English but also in Spanish
 
04:35:08.929 --> 04:35:08.939 align:start position:0%
um and I know some of you should have
 
04:35:11.330 --> 04:35:11.340 align:start position:0%
received copies uh the incumbent members
 
04:35:13.010 --> 04:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
the newer members will make sure that
 
04:35:14.929 --> 04:35:14.939 align:start position:0%
you get copies of that so that you can
 
04:35:20.510 --> 04:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
see uh that effort there's also a a web
 
04:35:22.131 --> 04:35:22.141 align:start position:0%
page that goes along with that that's
 
04:35:26.510 --> 04:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
interactive with the investor
 
04:35:28.970 --> 04:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
and so that's an important resource and
 
04:35:30.949 --> 04:35:30.959 align:start position:0%
they're also reaching out Securities is
 
04:35:35.150 --> 04:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
also going out and speaking to groups
 
04:35:40.730 --> 04:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:40.740 --> 04:35:42.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:35:42.070 --> 04:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:45.109 --> 04:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
we have the campaign Finance system
 
04:35:47.029 --> 04:35:47.039 align:start position:0%
which you know I think some of you have
 
04:35:50.510 --> 04:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
used that has been a problem because of
 
04:35:52.010 --> 04:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
the vendor situation that I had
 
04:35:55.429 --> 04:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
described earlier the contract we have
 
04:35:58.970 --> 04:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
with that vendor is finished in March we
 
04:36:01.189 --> 04:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
have a new vendor that is ready to go so
 
04:36:04.490 --> 04:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
you know the issues that we have had in
 
04:36:07.789 --> 04:36:07.799 align:start position:0%
the past will not be issues for the 2024
 
04:36:09.289 --> 04:36:09.299 align:start position:0%
election and
 
04:36:12.230 --> 04:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
we really look forward to that
 
04:36:12.240 --> 04:36:14.750 align:start position:0%
we really look forward to that
um

04:36:14.750 --> 04:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:18.349 --> 04:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:21.650 --> 04:36:21.660 align:start position:0%
but there is a
 
04:36:24.529 --> 04:36:24.539 align:start position:0%
a lot happening with policy decisions of
 
04:36:27.051 --> 04:36:27.061 align:start position:0%
the legislature related to post-election
 
04:36:29.109 --> 04:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
Audits and
 
04:36:32.390 --> 04:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature prior to the 2022
 
04:36:32.400 --> 04:36:33.429 align:start position:0%
the legislature prior to the 2022
election

04:36:33.429 --> 04:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
election
 
04:36:35.510 --> 04:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
required that the Secretary of State
 
04:36:35.520 --> 04:36:37.429 align:start position:0%
required that the Secretary of State
conduct

04:36:37.429 --> 04:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
04:36:40.131 --> 04:36:40.141 align:start position:0%
audits using high-speed scanners
 
04:36:42.709 --> 04:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
with two towns in the primary election
 
04:36:45.470 --> 04:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
we did four towns in the general
 
04:36:49.189 --> 04:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
election uh it was a very successful uh
 
04:36:49.199 --> 04:36:51.709 align:start position:0%
election uh it was a very successful uh
exercise

04:36:51.709 --> 04:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
exercise
 
04:36:54.470 --> 04:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
um there's a bill in by Senator gray to
 
04:36:57.109 --> 04:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
expand that uh and do it again
 
04:37:00.289 --> 04:37:00.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:00.299 --> 04:37:02.209 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:37:02.209 --> 04:37:02.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:04.609 --> 04:37:04.619 align:start position:0%
both Patty was very involved in that and
 
04:37:06.310 --> 04:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
I'll let her speak to that in a minute
 
04:37:10.269 --> 04:37:10.279 align:start position:0%
the other audit that we did was after
 
04:37:13.849 --> 04:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
the election was over and and we had the
 
04:37:16.310 --> 04:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
recounts there was a statute that
 
04:37:18.349 --> 04:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
required us to pick
 
04:37:22.369 --> 04:37:22.379 align:start position:0%
10 state representative recounts and
 
04:37:25.250 --> 04:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
then do a basically another recount for
 
04:37:27.949 --> 04:37:27.959 align:start position:0%
offices higher up on the ticket just to
 
04:37:31.310 --> 04:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
verify the results and we did that again
 
04:37:33.170 --> 04:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
a useful exercise
 
04:37:36.230 --> 04:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
the legislature required that we keep
 
04:37:40.070 --> 04:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
track of undervotes and over votes which
 
04:37:42.289 --> 04:37:42.299 align:start position:0%
was really helpful during the recount
 
04:37:44.269 --> 04:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
and the audit process because it you
 
04:37:45.551 --> 04:37:45.561 align:start position:0%
know it helped
 
04:37:48.650 --> 04:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
reconcile numbers a lot easier and
 
04:37:50.330 --> 04:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
better than we're able to do in the past
 
04:37:52.189 --> 04:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
and you know I think now that we had a
 
04:37:54.109 --> 04:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
taste of doing that you know we're going
 
04:37:57.410 --> 04:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
to refine the way that process worked
 
04:37:57.420 --> 04:37:58.189 align:start position:0%
to refine the way that process worked
um

04:37:58.189 --> 04:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:03.289 --> 04:38:03.299 align:start position:0%
it was challenging uh you know after the
 
04:38:04.970 --> 04:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
election because of the number of
 
04:38:07.429 --> 04:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
recounts that we had a record number of
 
04:38:10.369 --> 04:38:10.379 align:start position:0%
recounts in this last election and then
 
04:38:13.070 --> 04:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
the added uh requirement of doing the
 
04:38:15.830 --> 04:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
audits basically in the same time frame
 
04:38:18.709 --> 04:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
and so you know we were able to get the
 
04:38:21.289 --> 04:38:21.299 align:start position:0%
job done but yeah I think that we are
 
04:38:24.349 --> 04:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
going to have to ask for resources in
 
04:38:26.631 --> 04:38:26.641 align:start position:0%
terms of you know extra people to help
 
04:38:28.849 --> 04:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
with that effort
 
04:38:28.859 --> 04:38:29.769 align:start position:0%
with that effort
um

04:38:29.769 --> 04:38:29.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:33.051 --> 04:38:33.061 align:start position:0%
and uh yeah so we'll we'll be discussing
 
04:38:34.730 --> 04:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
that when those bills come before you
 
04:38:36.769 --> 04:38:36.779 align:start position:0%
again this session
 
04:38:40.609 --> 04:38:40.619 align:start position:0%
um in the budget we are asking for five
 
04:38:43.250 --> 04:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
additional positions uh the governor
 
04:38:46.131 --> 04:38:46.141 align:start position:0%
placed the positions in his budget uh
 
04:38:48.170 --> 04:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
they are not specific to elections but
 
04:38:49.910 --> 04:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
they are you know in the various
 
04:38:53.510 --> 04:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
divisions within the department
 
04:38:53.520 --> 04:38:54.170 align:start position:0%
divisions within the department
um

04:38:54.170 --> 04:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:55.730 --> 04:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
you know we're trying to make the
 
04:38:58.189 --> 04:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
department overall more efficient and
 
04:39:01.490 --> 04:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
and streamlined and and just being being
 
04:39:03.650 --> 04:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
in a better position to offer top
 
04:39:05.810 --> 04:39:05.820 align:start position:0%
quality service to you know the people
 
04:39:08.090 --> 04:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
that use our services uh moving forward
 
04:39:10.789 --> 04:39:10.799 align:start position:0%
and I think we've come a long way in a
 
04:39:13.789 --> 04:39:13.799 align:start position:0%
year and I'm really excited about you
 
04:39:15.109 --> 04:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
know where we're going to be a year from
 
04:39:15.119 --> 04:39:16.250 align:start position:0%
know where we're going to be a year from
now

04:39:16.250 --> 04:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:39:20.990 --> 04:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
um uh and uh I'm gonna I'm gonna stop
 
04:39:23.750 --> 04:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
there and let Patty and Aaron jump in
 
04:39:26.150 --> 04:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
Aaron has been the person in the office
 
04:39:28.789 --> 04:39:28.799 align:start position:0%
that has been you know working hard on
 
04:39:31.189 --> 04:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
the preparation of fiscal notes you know
 
04:39:32.570 --> 04:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
which are going to be important to your
 
04:39:35.390 --> 04:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
committee and Patty has been
 
04:39:39.288 --> 04:39:39.298 align:start position:0%
she's done a lot with the Audits and and
 
04:39:41.750 --> 04:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
the recounts but more importantly she's
 
04:39:43.670 --> 04:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
keeping track of
 
04:39:45.770 --> 04:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
the financial record keeping that we
 
04:39:47.750 --> 04:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that we comply with
 
04:39:50.390 --> 04:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
Federal audits related to the help
 
04:39:52.270 --> 04:39:52.280 align:start position:0%
America vote act and that that that
 
04:39:55.550 --> 04:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
requires uh you know ongoing reporting
 
04:39:57.230 --> 04:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
and we've been doing that and when
 
04:39:58.430 --> 04:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
they're done if you want to ask many
 
04:40:00.948 --> 04:40:00.958 align:start position:0%
questions about presidential primary I'm
 
04:40:03.288 --> 04:40:03.298 align:start position:0%
happy to talk about that I won't tell
 
04:40:04.670 --> 04:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
you the date that it's going to occur
 
04:40:09.170 --> 04:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
but but we could talk about it so Aaron
 
04:40:10.130 --> 04:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you want to say anything
 
04:40:13.430 --> 04:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
about a fiscal note process
 
04:40:13.440 --> 04:40:14.090 align:start position:0%
about a fiscal note process
um

04:40:14.090 --> 04:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:16.070 --> 04:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
you're on the other side of that now
 
04:40:18.230 --> 04:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
having to prepare it you guys are the
 
04:40:20.390 --> 04:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
ones that get to see the you know the
 
04:40:21.770 --> 04:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
finished product but I don't have any
 
04:40:23.868 --> 04:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
comments on that uh I
 
04:40:25.730 --> 04:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
can't well I'll just have to say that
 
04:40:27.350 --> 04:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's much different process being
 
04:40:29.390 --> 04:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
on the other side and having to respond
 
04:40:32.868 --> 04:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
very timely to what I consider to be a
 
04:40:36.230 --> 04:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
lot of fiscal notes but it was uh much
 
04:40:38.330 --> 04:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
easier to write having been on the other
 
04:40:40.130 --> 04:40:40.140 align:start position:0%
side trying to read them but if you have
 
04:40:41.690 --> 04:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
any questions on them please reach out
 
04:40:43.610 --> 04:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
because sometimes I don't want to throw
 
04:40:45.830 --> 04:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
the LBA under the bus but they have to
 
04:40:48.530 --> 04:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
take from all the different
 
04:40:50.390 --> 04:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
um Department sometimes on various
 
04:40:52.250 --> 04:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
different fiscal notes and consolidate
 
04:40:54.590 --> 04:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
all the information so sometimes some of
 
04:40:56.510 --> 04:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
what I consider important stuff kind of
 
04:40:59.330 --> 04:40:59.340 align:start position:0%
gets left out so I'll I'll try and point
 
04:41:02.270 --> 04:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
that out to you but
 
04:41:04.490 --> 04:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
it's and I will say it's it's a
 
04:41:06.830 --> 04:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
challenge for the department when there
 
04:41:08.690 --> 04:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
are a lot of bills
 
04:41:11.510 --> 04:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh that have been filed related to
 
04:41:14.690 --> 04:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
elections for example that get thrown at
 
04:41:17.810 --> 04:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
us in a very short time frame and some
 
04:41:21.350 --> 04:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
of them are very involved so I know that
 
04:41:23.930 --> 04:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
you know some of the some of the bills
 
04:41:25.610 --> 04:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes say that this was sent to
 
04:41:27.530 --> 04:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
the Department of State we haven't heard
 
04:41:29.628 --> 04:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
back yet it's not because
 
04:41:31.788 --> 04:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
we're ignoring it it's just because we
 
04:41:33.410 --> 04:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten there yet you know given
 
04:41:35.628 --> 04:41:35.638 align:start position:0%
the the priorities that we've been
 
04:41:40.430 --> 04:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:41.390 --> 04:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
the picture is talking about
 
04:41:43.250 --> 04:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
post-election audits this was the first
 
04:41:45.170 --> 04:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
time that we did them you will see other
 
04:41:47.930 --> 04:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
bills coming forward for more of them uh
 
04:41:49.730 --> 04:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
the one thing you need to keep in mind
 
04:41:52.310 --> 04:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
is we have a very short window
 
04:41:54.530 --> 04:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
elections are on Tuesday
 
04:41:57.230 --> 04:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
Wednesday we go out and pick up all the
 
04:41:57.240 --> 04:41:58.610 align:start position:0%
Wednesday we go out and pick up all the
ballots

04:41:58.610 --> 04:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
04:42:00.410 --> 04:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
um that are for the towns that have been
 
04:42:03.110 --> 04:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
selected for for doing recounts we have
 
04:42:05.208 --> 04:42:05.218 align:start position:0%
to do them on Thursday because Friday is
 
04:42:08.030 --> 04:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
the last day that anyone has to request
 
04:42:09.948 --> 04:42:09.958 align:start position:0%
a recount
 
04:42:11.270 --> 04:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
um so there's a there's a short window
 
04:42:14.350 --> 04:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
the Senate uh election law yesterday
 
04:42:17.990 --> 04:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
passed increasing instead of doing four
 
04:42:19.910 --> 04:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
after the general election we would do
 
04:42:22.490 --> 04:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
six and we think that we can still
 
04:42:24.890 --> 04:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
handle handle that but it'll it's going
 
04:42:26.810 --> 04:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
to be very tight
 
04:42:28.850 --> 04:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
um so I know a lot of people want to do
 
04:42:32.448 --> 04:42:32.458 align:start position:0%
more um post-selection audits uh but if
 
04:42:34.190 --> 04:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
you want to have them done
 
04:42:37.190 --> 04:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
prior to when people uh can request a
 
04:42:39.470 --> 04:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
recount or just remember that very tight
 
04:42:39.480 --> 04:42:40.850 align:start position:0%
recount or just remember that very tight
friend

04:42:40.850 --> 04:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
friend
 
04:42:42.590 --> 04:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
um the secretary also talked about the
 
04:42:44.628 --> 04:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
Hava funds you know we have the help
 
04:42:46.250 --> 04:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
America vote funds we have been
 
04:42:49.430 --> 04:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
receiving funds at various different
 
04:42:51.708 --> 04:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
iterations there's three different
 
04:42:54.650 --> 04:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
um groups of Hava funds we started
 
04:42:56.810 --> 04:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
getting them in the early 2000s we're
 
04:42:59.390 --> 04:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
actually applying right now for the in
 
04:43:01.788 --> 04:43:01.798 align:start position:0%
the latest budget that was passed by
 
04:43:04.368 --> 04:43:04.378 align:start position:0%
Congress there's another tranche of
 
04:43:06.410 --> 04:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
money and we're entitled to a million
 
04:43:09.470 --> 04:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
dollars which we're filing for now which
 
04:43:10.970 --> 04:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
we have to kind of say how we're going
 
04:43:13.150 --> 04:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
to use it et cetera
 
04:43:15.770 --> 04:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
there have been if you hang around in
 
04:43:17.930 --> 04:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
election law at all there's a lot of
 
04:43:20.868 --> 04:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
people who have ideas that they want to
 
04:43:23.208 --> 04:43:23.218 align:start position:0%
change things that they want to do and
 
04:43:24.288 --> 04:43:24.298 align:start position:0%
they'll always say well you can use the
 
04:43:26.090 --> 04:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
Hall of funds you can use the Java funds
 
04:43:27.708 --> 04:43:27.718 align:start position:0%
and you will hear that in this committee
 
04:43:30.350 --> 04:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
that well there's all these Java funds
 
04:43:32.628 --> 04:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
um there is a state law that requires us
 
04:43:35.330 --> 04:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
to keep 12 years of the maintenance
 
04:43:37.430 --> 04:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
costs basically of running our elections
 
04:43:39.110 --> 04:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
and running the
 
04:43:41.150 --> 04:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
um the Statewide voter registration
 
04:43:44.330 --> 04:43:44.340 align:start position:0%
system Etc we do that calculation in
 
04:43:46.850 --> 04:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
fact I just recently did it
 
04:43:48.650 --> 04:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
um and I you know I do a three-year
 
04:43:50.510 --> 04:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
rolling average I look at the cost over
 
04:43:52.368 --> 04:43:52.378 align:start position:0%
the last three years and average it and
 
04:43:54.530 --> 04:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
say okay we need to have 12 times that
 
04:43:56.628 --> 04:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:43:59.150 --> 04:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
um we've got about a million one million
 
04:44:03.288 --> 04:44:03.298 align:start position:0%
two maybe over and above that 12 year
 
04:44:05.628 --> 04:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
um maintenance and we will be getting
 
04:44:07.250 --> 04:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
this additional million but we are
 
04:44:08.510 --> 04:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
spending money out of that because we're
 
04:44:11.030 --> 04:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
doing that new voter registration system
 
04:44:14.330 --> 04:44:14.340 align:start position:0%
so there is not it's as much as people
 
04:44:16.670 --> 04:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
will like to say there's this big pile
 
04:44:20.208 --> 04:44:20.218 align:start position:0%
of of half a dollars out there that
 
04:44:21.830 --> 04:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
um I mean even when I was here on
 
04:44:24.708 --> 04:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
division one we had multiple
 
04:44:26.150 --> 04:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
bills that came forward well you could
 
04:44:27.470 --> 04:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
use the Java funds for that well you
 
04:44:28.910 --> 04:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
could use the Java funds for that and
 
04:44:31.610 --> 04:44:31.620 align:start position:0%
and here since any of those kinds of
 
04:44:34.010 --> 04:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
bills will come to division one I just
 
04:44:36.110 --> 04:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
want to make you aware of the fact that
 
04:44:38.810 --> 04:44:38.820 align:start position:0%
they're the hop-up funds it's not this
 
04:44:41.448 --> 04:44:41.458 align:start position:0%
big pile of money that's a lot of it is
 
04:44:41.458 --> 04:44:43.310 align:start position:0%
big pile of money that's a lot of it is
encumbered

04:44:43.310 --> 04:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
encumbered
 
04:44:46.550 --> 04:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
I'll just add to what Patty said that
 
04:44:50.810 --> 04:44:50.820 align:start position:0%
the the 12 times is important because it
 
04:44:54.830 --> 04:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
allows uh our office to spend
 
04:44:57.410 --> 04:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
right around a million dollars a year to
 
04:44:59.868 --> 04:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
maintain the mandates of the federal
 
04:45:02.690 --> 04:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
health America to vote act and so that
 
04:45:05.030 --> 04:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
money that million dollars isn't just
 
04:45:08.990 --> 04:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
free money it it actually pays for
 
04:45:11.448 --> 04:45:11.458 align:start position:0%
the staff that we have up in the hub
 
04:45:13.310 --> 04:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
office and I think currently we have
 
04:45:15.948 --> 04:45:15.958 align:start position:0%
four or five full-time staff members up
 
04:45:18.670 --> 04:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
there that are
 
04:45:21.110 --> 04:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
involved with preparing the training
 
04:45:23.230 --> 04:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
program for local election officials
 
04:45:27.470 --> 04:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
they they maintain the uh
 
04:45:29.570 --> 04:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:45:31.910 --> 04:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
information that is in the Statewide
 
04:45:34.310 --> 04:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
database making sure that it's accurate
 
04:45:36.770 --> 04:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
and you know they're constantly cleaning
 
04:45:36.780 --> 04:45:37.628 align:start position:0%
and you know they're constantly cleaning
it

04:45:37.628 --> 04:45:37.638 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:45:41.448 --> 04:45:41.458 align:start position:0%
and and then individuals that work with
 
04:45:45.050 --> 04:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
the accessible voting equipment which is
 
04:45:46.610 --> 04:45:46.620 align:start position:0%
actually very time consuming process
 
04:45:49.368 --> 04:45:49.378 align:start position:0%
because you know you get your ballot on
 
04:45:53.030 --> 04:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
on Election Day uh you you read it in
 
04:45:55.128 --> 04:45:55.138 align:start position:0%
your Market you know you put it in the
 
04:45:57.890 --> 04:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
The Ballot Box or the machine and that's
 
04:46:01.490 --> 04:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
it but the but the accessible ballot is
 
04:46:04.190 --> 04:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
a ballot that has actually read to the
 
04:46:08.690 --> 04:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
voter and so though those and each
 
04:46:10.368 --> 04:46:10.378 align:start position:0%
ballot is different because of the
 
04:46:12.470 --> 04:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
various rotation schemes that are on it
 
04:46:16.368 --> 04:46:16.378 align:start position:0%
so each individual ballot has to be
 
04:46:18.830 --> 04:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
put into the system so it could be read
 
04:46:21.470 --> 04:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
back to the voter it has to be proofed
 
04:46:24.708 --> 04:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that the voice on the
 
04:46:27.650 --> 04:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
machine is pronouncing the candidate's
 
04:46:30.230 --> 04:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
name properly and and that's a real
 
04:46:33.350 --> 04:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
challenge sometimes but but you know
 
04:46:35.448 --> 04:46:35.458 align:start position:0%
these processes are a lot more involved
 
04:46:38.350 --> 04:46:38.360 align:start position:0%
than they might appear on the surface
 
04:46:42.128 --> 04:46:42.138 align:start position:0%
the money is used to
 
04:46:46.010 --> 04:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
help pay for uh
 
04:46:48.110 --> 04:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
you know improvements to the software
 
04:46:50.330 --> 04:46:50.340 align:start position:0%
systems that we have as I mentioned
 
04:46:52.490 --> 04:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
we're on the third generation of
 
04:46:54.230 --> 04:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
accessible voting equipment
 
04:46:57.170 --> 04:46:57.180 align:start position:0%
the fund pays for that and so to the
 
04:46:58.490 --> 04:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
extent that
 
04:47:00.890 --> 04:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
we we tap into the principle of mouth
 
04:47:03.288 --> 04:47:03.298 align:start position:0%
the 12 times
 
04:47:05.930 --> 04:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
and spend that down it just speeds up
 
04:47:08.628 --> 04:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
the time at which we run out and then
 
04:47:09.830 --> 04:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to go to the general
 
04:47:13.490 --> 04:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
fund every time we need to work on this
 
04:47:16.250 --> 04:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
program so you know the goal was the
 
04:47:17.990 --> 04:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
Federal Government told us we had to do
 
04:47:20.390 --> 04:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
something legislature decided to create
 
04:47:23.868 --> 04:47:23.878 align:start position:0%
the the election fund so that we could
 
04:47:25.850 --> 04:47:25.860 align:start position:0%
keep as much principle to earn interest
 
04:47:30.110 --> 04:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
to fund the mandated programs into the
 
04:47:32.810 --> 04:47:32.820 align:start position:0%
future and here we are 20 years after
 
04:47:32.820 --> 04:47:33.770 align:start position:0%
future and here we are 20 years after
the

04:47:33.770 --> 04:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:47:35.810 --> 04:47:35.820 align:start position:0%
help America boat Act was originally
 
04:47:38.090 --> 04:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
passed and we still have a healthy
 
04:47:40.910 --> 04:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
balance in that account that allows us
 
04:47:43.490 --> 04:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
to continue to pay for those programs so
 
04:47:46.610 --> 04:47:46.620 align:start position:0%
I think that's a success story and one
 
04:47:49.850 --> 04:47:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:52.250 --> 04:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
questions for the secretary or his
 
04:47:52.260 --> 04:47:55.610 align:start position:0%
questions for the secretary or his
deputies

04:47:55.610 --> 04:47:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:58.070 --> 04:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
04:47:59.868 --> 04:47:59.878 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr secretary for
 
04:48:02.030 --> 04:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
coming I heard you say early on that
 
04:48:06.910 --> 04:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
security fines pay for that department
 
04:48:09.890 --> 04:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
the security fines not go to the general
 
04:48:14.030 --> 04:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
fund are they kept separately somehow or
 
04:48:16.128 --> 04:48:16.138 align:start position:0%
uh you know to be honest with you I
 
04:48:18.410 --> 04:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
don't know how they you know I don't
 
04:48:19.730 --> 04:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
think that they collect the fines and
 
04:48:21.590 --> 04:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
then just spend it I think that you know
 
04:48:23.628 --> 04:48:23.638 align:start position:0%
they get entered into the state
 
04:48:25.610 --> 04:48:25.620 align:start position:0%
Finance system
 
04:48:27.530 --> 04:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if they go to the
 
04:48:29.208 --> 04:48:29.218 align:start position:0%
general flight I think if they lapse to
 
04:48:31.368 --> 04:48:31.378 align:start position:0%
the general fund I'm pretty sure I'll
 
04:48:32.868 --> 04:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
double check but I'm pretty sure they
 
04:48:35.150 --> 04:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
latched to the Delta they are the
 
04:48:37.368 --> 04:48:37.378 align:start position:0%
Securities is allowed to keep
 
04:48:39.708 --> 04:48:39.718 align:start position:0%
uh hmm
 
04:48:43.910 --> 04:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
from those funds 750 000 for its budget
 
04:48:46.310 --> 04:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the money is in state treasurer
 
04:48:48.410 --> 04:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
has that money you know it's not in a
 
04:48:51.770 --> 04:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
secret account insecurities but so the
 
04:48:54.770 --> 04:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
750 000 it gives them a starting point
 
04:48:58.070 --> 04:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
to start off the new fiscal year and
 
04:48:59.810 --> 04:48:59.820 align:start position:0%
then over the course of that you know
 
04:49:02.930 --> 04:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
they collect fines that will pay for the
 
04:49:06.350 --> 04:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
entire fiscal years program and then any
 
04:49:10.070 --> 04:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
at the end when they're done any
 
04:49:12.288 --> 04:49:12.298 align:start position:0%
money that they have has been collected
 
04:49:17.030 --> 04:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
in fines above that 750 000 then lapses
 
04:49:18.948 --> 04:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
to the general fund
 
04:49:22.970 --> 04:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah continue thank you yeah this
 
04:49:25.730 --> 04:49:25.740 align:start position:0%
is just a red flag for me because I'm
 
04:49:28.490 --> 04:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
involved in a similar thing in the
 
04:49:30.948 --> 04:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
different area anyway
 
04:49:32.868 --> 04:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
um what's the retention period for
 
04:49:32.878 --> 04:49:34.730 align:start position:0%
um what's the retention period for
ballots

04:49:34.730 --> 04:49:34.740 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
04:49:37.550 --> 04:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh ballots for
 
04:49:40.788 --> 04:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
for ballots that have Federal elections
 
04:49:43.368 --> 04:49:43.378 align:start position:0%
on them which are our state ballots it's
 
04:49:46.490 --> 04:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
22 months from the election
 
04:49:48.708 --> 04:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
and that is only if there's not some
 
04:49:51.830 --> 04:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
pending court case or something that you
 
04:49:53.208 --> 04:49:53.218 align:start position:0%
know that requires them to be kept
 
04:49:55.788 --> 04:49:55.798 align:start position:0%
longer but for state and federal ballots
 
04:49:58.850 --> 04:49:58.860 align:start position:0%
it's 22 months for local ballots for
 
04:50:00.948 --> 04:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
your local elections I believe it's 60
 
04:50:00.958 --> 04:50:02.750 align:start position:0%
your local elections I believe it's 60
days

04:50:02.750 --> 04:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
days
 
04:50:05.810 --> 04:50:05.820 align:start position:0%
and towns actually like when there's a
 
04:50:08.448 --> 04:50:08.458 align:start position:0%
recount related to their town because
 
04:50:10.430 --> 04:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
then we pick up the ballots and we keep
 
04:50:12.770 --> 04:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
them for 22 months as opposed to the
 
04:50:16.190 --> 04:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
town having to keep them for 22 months I
 
04:50:18.490 --> 04:50:18.500 align:start position:0%
see thank you and you use the term
 
04:50:21.708 --> 04:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
electronic poll books what is that
 
04:50:26.030 --> 04:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
an electronic poll book is a a device
 
04:50:26.040 --> 04:50:28.190 align:start position:0%
an electronic poll book is a a device
uh

04:50:28.190 --> 04:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:50:31.490 --> 04:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
that has computer technology that
 
04:50:33.610 --> 04:50:33.620 align:start position:0%
that will
 
04:50:35.810 --> 04:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
it's currently choose to New Hampshire
 
04:50:37.128 --> 04:50:37.138 align:start position:0%
in this way
 
04:50:37.138 --> 04:50:37.730 align:start position:0%
in this way
um

04:50:37.730 --> 04:50:37.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:40.190 --> 04:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
it's used at the check-in station
 
04:50:43.670 --> 04:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
because the entire checklist is in the
 
04:50:46.310 --> 04:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
epoll book a voter can go to any
 
04:50:48.050 --> 04:50:48.060 align:start position:0%
check-in station regardless of where
 
04:50:50.510 --> 04:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
their name appears in the alphabet so it
 
04:50:53.510 --> 04:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
speeds the line process up if a voter
 
04:50:55.970 --> 04:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
has a driver's license from New
 
04:50:55.980 --> 04:50:56.868 align:start position:0%
has a driver's license from New
Hampshire

04:50:56.868 --> 04:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:51:00.230 --> 04:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
the machine can read the information and
 
04:51:02.810 --> 04:51:02.820 align:start position:0%
populate the data that the ballot clerks
 
04:51:04.430 --> 04:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
need to collect to be able to check in a
 
04:51:07.850 --> 04:51:07.860 align:start position:0%
voter so that's speeds things up if the
 
04:51:09.910 --> 04:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
voter doesn't does not have
 
04:51:13.070 --> 04:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
a state driver's license which they're
 
04:51:14.810 --> 04:51:14.820 align:start position:0%
supposed to show to prove their identity
 
04:51:17.690 --> 04:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
they simply start typing in the voter's
 
04:51:20.270 --> 04:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
last name and author's name is on the
 
04:51:22.010 --> 04:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
checklist that's going to automatically
 
04:51:23.810 --> 04:51:23.820 align:start position:0%
pop up
 
04:51:27.910 --> 04:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
um and then once the polls have closed
 
04:51:30.410 --> 04:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
they can simply push
 
04:51:36.350 --> 04:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
a button uh and the number of the the
 
04:51:39.530 --> 04:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
number of Voters who checked in shows up
 
04:51:42.470 --> 04:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
like that so it saves the supervisors of
 
04:51:44.930 --> 04:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
the checklist the chore of going through
 
04:51:47.390 --> 04:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
each page of the checklist and Counting
 
04:51:50.990 --> 04:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
the names and then finally we are
 
04:51:54.490 --> 04:51:54.500 align:start position:0%
currently working on an interface
 
04:51:57.670 --> 04:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
software program that will allow
 
04:51:57.680 --> 04:51:59.270 align:start position:0%
software program that will allow
the

04:51:59.270 --> 04:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:52:01.970 --> 04:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
the local election officials that have
 
04:52:04.490 --> 04:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
used the knee poll book to be able to
 
04:52:07.910 --> 04:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
connect with our centralized voter
 
04:52:10.208 --> 04:52:10.218 align:start position:0%
database and transmit that information
 
04:52:14.030 --> 04:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
in a safe and secure way so that the
 
04:52:15.890 --> 04:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist don't have
 
04:52:17.990 --> 04:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
to spend hours going through the
 
04:52:19.850 --> 04:52:19.860 align:start position:0%
checklist recording all the names of the
 
04:52:22.368 --> 04:52:22.378 align:start position:0%
individuals that voted uh that
 
04:52:25.190 --> 04:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
information will be populated very
 
04:52:29.030 --> 04:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
quickly uh okay one quick follow-up so
 
04:52:32.150 --> 04:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
do towns buy those from you or do you
 
04:52:34.490 --> 04:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
provide them or how does that work no
 
04:52:37.070 --> 04:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
the the towns are responsible for
 
04:52:39.288 --> 04:52:39.298 align:start position:0%
purchasing them themselves if they want
 
04:52:41.208 --> 04:52:41.218 align:start position:0%
to use them it's a local decision
 
04:52:43.670 --> 04:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
whether they do it or not the ones that
 
04:52:45.590 --> 04:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
are using it have found it to be a
 
04:52:47.830 --> 04:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
benefit in the time savings
 
04:52:50.930 --> 04:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
there is additional functionality in
 
04:52:53.510 --> 04:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
those devices that could be used that
 
04:52:55.430 --> 04:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
are not permitted currently in New
 
04:52:57.830 --> 04:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for example actually voter
 
04:52:59.530 --> 04:52:59.540 align:start position:0%
taking voter registrations
 
04:53:02.510 --> 04:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
on the devices
 
04:53:02.520 --> 04:53:04.030 align:start position:0%
on the devices
um

04:53:04.030 --> 04:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:06.948 --> 04:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
there is not a
 
04:53:10.610 --> 04:53:10.620 align:start position:0%
uniform standard that has been approved
 
04:53:13.070 --> 04:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
by any entity that oversees elections
 
04:53:14.510 --> 04:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of
 
04:53:17.750 --> 04:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
and so uh you know these devices have
 
04:53:21.230 --> 04:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
been tested and used in other states but
 
04:53:22.610 --> 04:53:22.620 align:start position:0%
there have been some pretty dramatic
 
04:53:25.490 --> 04:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
failures of them in other states too so
 
04:53:27.890 --> 04:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
when they're used in New Hampshire we
 
04:53:30.470 --> 04:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
require that they also maintain a paper
 
04:53:32.990 --> 04:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
checklist so that if they're four hours
 
04:53:36.350 --> 04:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
into the election things crash
 
04:53:38.628 --> 04:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
um that they can just revert back to the
 
04:53:41.270 --> 04:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
paper checklist and keep going as if it
 
04:53:42.948 --> 04:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
never happened
 
04:53:46.490 --> 04:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
um idea would it would be nice if we can
 
04:53:47.990 --> 04:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
get to the point that we're comfortable
 
04:53:49.670 --> 04:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
enough that we don't have to
 
04:53:52.788 --> 04:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
require that duplicate effort but for
 
04:53:54.230 --> 04:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
the time being I think it's it's
 
04:53:58.550 --> 04:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:00.530 --> 04:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:54:00.540 --> 04:54:02.150 align:start position:0%
further questions
um representative

04:54:02.150 --> 04:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
04:54:05.030 --> 04:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you hello Mr secretary
 
04:54:05.040 --> 04:54:06.890 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you hello Mr secretary
and

04:54:06.890 --> 04:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:54:09.650 --> 04:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
um my question had to do with the ballot
 
04:54:11.750 --> 04:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
counting devices you said that you're
 
04:54:16.128 --> 04:54:16.138 align:start position:0%
testing new ones so once and then it
 
04:54:18.530 --> 04:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
goes I'm interested in the process so
 
04:54:19.910 --> 04:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
then it goes to the ballot law
 
04:54:21.650 --> 04:54:21.660 align:start position:0%
commission they select one and then
 
04:54:24.770 --> 04:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
who's responsible so then all
 
04:54:27.830 --> 04:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities upgrade or who pays for
 
04:54:31.190 --> 04:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
those or how does all that work
 
04:54:33.948 --> 04:54:33.958 align:start position:0%
so there's several questions in that in
 
04:54:37.550 --> 04:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
that question the the the process right
 
04:54:39.170 --> 04:54:39.180 align:start position:0%
now is that
 
04:54:41.390 --> 04:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
that there are standards
 
04:54:44.390 --> 04:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
there are federal standards for ballot
 
04:54:46.070 --> 04:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
counting devices that are used in
 
04:54:46.080 --> 04:54:47.270 align:start position:0%
counting devices that are used in
elections

04:54:47.270 --> 04:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
elections
 
04:54:49.190 --> 04:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
and the election assistance commission
 
04:54:50.930 --> 04:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
which is the federal agency that is
 
04:54:52.550 --> 04:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for that
 
04:54:55.730 --> 04:54:55.740 align:start position:0%
is getting very close now to approving
 
04:54:59.390 --> 04:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
the next level of standard
 
04:54:59.400 --> 04:55:00.288 align:start position:0%
the next level of standard
um

04:55:00.288 --> 04:55:00.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:04.550 --> 04:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
the the three devices that we are
 
04:55:04.560 --> 04:55:06.230 align:start position:0%
the the three devices that we are
testing

04:55:06.230 --> 04:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
testing
 
04:55:09.230 --> 04:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
at the local elections coming up all
 
04:55:11.990 --> 04:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
have the lower standard but we don't
 
04:55:14.090 --> 04:55:14.100 align:start position:0%
know yet if they would meet the higher
 
04:55:16.010 --> 04:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
standard the companies of course claim
 
04:55:17.090 --> 04:55:17.100 align:start position:0%
that they will
 
04:55:19.570 --> 04:55:19.580 align:start position:0%
but once the EAC
 
04:55:22.850 --> 04:55:22.860 align:start position:0%
establishes those standards then
 
04:55:24.948 --> 04:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
the companies that manufacture the
 
04:55:26.570 --> 04:55:26.580 align:start position:0%
machines will then
 
04:55:28.550 --> 04:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
have to make sure their machine meets
 
04:55:31.070 --> 04:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
the standard and then submit it to a
 
04:55:33.410 --> 04:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
national you know certified National
 
04:55:33.420 --> 04:55:36.470 align:start position:0%
national you know certified National
Laboratory

04:55:36.470 --> 04:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:38.690 --> 04:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
for a complete review and confirmation
 
04:55:41.208 --> 04:55:41.218 align:start position:0%
that yes you know these systems meet the
 
04:55:43.730 --> 04:55:43.740 align:start position:0%
new standard and that that's the
 
04:55:45.650 --> 04:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
confidence that we need where the ballot
 
04:55:48.350 --> 04:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
commission needs to say uh if they
 
04:55:50.510 --> 04:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
select a device and meets that standard
 
04:55:52.430 --> 04:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
yeah this is the one that makes the most
 
04:55:56.150 --> 04:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:59.570 --> 04:55:59.580 align:start position:0%
it is not practical for the ballot
 
04:56:01.730 --> 04:56:01.740 align:start position:0%
commission to approve more than two
 
04:56:04.190 --> 04:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
devices because New Hampshire is such a
 
04:56:07.730 --> 04:56:07.740 align:start position:0%
small market for these devices that you
 
04:56:09.410 --> 04:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
know if we approve more I mean ideally
 
04:56:13.430 --> 04:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
just one would be would be good because
 
04:56:13.440 --> 04:56:14.628 align:start position:0%
just one would be would be good because
um

04:56:14.628 --> 04:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:16.970 --> 04:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
yeah there just isn't enough market here
 
04:56:19.368 --> 04:56:19.378 align:start position:0%
for the companies to be interested to
 
04:56:21.650 --> 04:56:21.660 align:start position:0%
give us good pricing and to maintain
 
04:56:25.670 --> 04:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
them and even Market their product here
 
04:56:25.680 --> 04:56:27.770 align:start position:0%
them and even Market their product here
um

04:56:27.770 --> 04:56:27.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:32.090 --> 04:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
in terms of who pays for them it is a
 
04:56:35.448 --> 04:56:35.458 align:start position:0%
local decision whether a town or a city
 
04:56:37.788 --> 04:56:37.798 align:start position:0%
is going to use a ballot accounting
 
04:56:40.010 --> 04:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
device to Cather ballots obviously
 
04:56:43.190 --> 04:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
there's some savings to them by not
 
04:56:44.990 --> 04:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
doing it by hand which is very time
 
04:56:45.000 --> 04:56:46.788 align:start position:0%
doing it by hand which is very time
consuming

04:56:46.788 --> 04:56:46.798 align:start position:0%
consuming
 
04:56:46.798 --> 04:56:47.448 align:start position:0%
consuming
um

04:56:47.448 --> 04:56:47.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:49.730 --> 04:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
and I know that there are some
 
04:56:51.708 --> 04:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
communities that use the devices that
 
04:56:53.570 --> 04:56:53.580 align:start position:0%
are already setting a certain amount of
 
04:56:56.510 --> 04:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
money aside so that when the approval is
 
04:56:59.270 --> 04:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
made they can be purchased
 
04:56:59.280 --> 04:57:01.128 align:start position:0%
made they can be purchased
the

04:57:01.128 --> 04:57:01.138 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:57:03.650 --> 04:57:03.660 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
04:57:06.530 --> 04:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
has released Hopper funds
 
04:57:09.410 --> 04:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
for specific purposes and
 
04:57:12.590 --> 04:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic there was a good
 
04:57:15.470 --> 04:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
sized block of money that was issued for
 
04:57:18.288 --> 04:57:18.298 align:start position:0%
security because if you remember prior
 
04:57:20.150 --> 04:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
to the pandemic everybody was concerned
 
04:57:22.490 --> 04:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
about foreign actors hacking into our
 
04:57:25.910 --> 04:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
systems and so a large sum of money was
 
04:57:25.920 --> 04:57:27.050 align:start position:0%
systems and so a large sum of money was
issued

04:57:27.050 --> 04:57:27.060 align:start position:0%
issued
 
04:57:29.030 --> 04:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to fight that
 
04:57:32.030 --> 04:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
the then a year later we had the
 
04:57:34.910 --> 04:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic and we were issued in excess of
 
04:57:37.430 --> 04:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
three million dollars to be able to help
 
04:57:40.128 --> 04:57:40.138 align:start position:0%
fund elections you know with those
 
04:57:42.050 --> 04:57:42.060 align:start position:0%
conditions and so
 
04:57:44.448 --> 04:57:44.458 align:start position:0%
we gave all of the three point I think
 
04:57:46.788 --> 04:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
it was 3.3 million dollars
 
04:57:49.010 --> 04:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
to the cities and towns
 
04:57:51.770 --> 04:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
and we did it in two ways we we used
 
04:57:54.910 --> 04:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
money to purchase uh PPE
 
04:57:59.270 --> 04:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
masks hand sanitizer big screens that
 
04:58:02.390 --> 04:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
could protect the ballot clerks from the
 
04:58:04.610 --> 04:58:04.620 align:start position:0%
um downs and you know all of the
 
04:58:06.830 --> 04:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
materials you needed in a pulp in a
 
04:58:09.110 --> 04:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
polling place to keep people safe
 
04:58:11.628 --> 04:58:11.638 align:start position:0%
and then the balance that the large
 
04:58:13.250 --> 04:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
balance probably three million dollars
 
04:58:14.750 --> 04:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
of that money
 
04:58:17.990 --> 04:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
we simply gave to the cities and towns
 
04:58:21.170 --> 04:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
on the basis of the number of absentee
 
04:58:21.180 --> 04:58:22.310 align:start position:0%
on the basis of the number of absentee
ballots

04:58:22.310 --> 04:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
04:58:25.730 --> 04:58:25.740 align:start position:0%
that were issued for that election and
 
04:58:27.470 --> 04:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
as you know there were roughly three
 
04:58:28.970 --> 04:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
times the number of absentee ballots
 
04:58:32.350 --> 04:58:32.360 align:start position:0%
that were cast in that election
 
04:58:36.350 --> 04:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
which shifted the workload significantly
 
04:58:40.850 --> 04:58:40.860 align:start position:0%
to the clerk's and the moderators
 
04:58:43.970 --> 04:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
and in my opinion it was that large
 
04:58:46.368 --> 04:58:46.378 align:start position:0%
number of absentee ballots that caused
 
04:58:49.490 --> 04:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
the problem in Windham because they were
 
04:58:51.708 --> 04:58:51.718 align:start position:0%
dealing with such a volume they decided
 
04:58:53.990 --> 04:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
to take a shortcut use a letter folding
 
04:58:56.530 --> 04:58:56.540 align:start position:0%
device that wasn't folding the ballots
 
04:58:59.930 --> 04:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
properly on the on the and so you know
 
04:59:01.730 --> 04:59:01.740 align:start position:0%
we ended up with that problem and then
 
04:59:04.910 --> 04:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
Bedford was dealing with a huge number
 
04:59:07.368 --> 04:59:07.378 align:start position:0%
of absentee ballots and they just a lot
 
04:59:11.510 --> 04:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
they lost track of a sack of ballots and
 
04:59:13.788 --> 04:59:13.798 align:start position:0%
they never got they never got processed
 
04:59:15.530 --> 04:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
or counted um
 
04:59:17.390 --> 04:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
and but you can see how it would happen
 
04:59:19.430 --> 04:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
because of the way they were you know
 
04:59:22.070 --> 04:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
they were overloaded
 
04:59:24.530 --> 04:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
um but anyway you know those monies were
 
04:59:28.190 --> 04:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
dispersed in in that manner now Congress
 
04:59:31.970 --> 04:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
is has authorized a new round of
 
04:59:35.150 --> 04:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
additional funding
 
04:59:35.160 --> 04:59:35.990 align:start position:0%
additional funding
um

04:59:35.990 --> 04:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:37.970 --> 04:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
Patty mentioned that it's a million
 
04:59:40.368 --> 04:59:40.378 align:start position:0%
dollars and we have to provide a 20
 
04:59:42.110 --> 04:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
State match
 
04:59:45.050 --> 04:59:45.060 align:start position:0%
to go along with that but because we
 
04:59:49.250 --> 04:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
have the 12 times amount that we need
 
04:59:53.570 --> 04:59:53.580 align:start position:0%
um that money could be used to at least
 
04:59:55.670 --> 04:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
subsidize the purchase of you know
 
04:59:57.470 --> 04:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
additional voting equipment
 
04:59:59.270 --> 04:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
um you know that could be just around
 
05:00:02.208 --> 05:00:02.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:02.218 --> 05:00:03.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:00:03.350 --> 05:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:04.788 --> 05:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
you know whether it's ballot counting
 
05:00:06.708 --> 05:00:06.718 align:start position:0%
machines or whether it's the poll books
 
05:00:08.750 --> 05:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
I mean I think both of them
 
05:00:12.050 --> 05:00:12.060 align:start position:0%
will continue to to be improved and you
 
05:00:13.368 --> 05:00:13.378 align:start position:0%
know will be used more and more in
 
05:00:18.170 --> 05:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:20.690 --> 05:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
I don't see any of the questions uh
 
05:00:23.030 --> 05:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Mr secretary and
 
05:00:24.590 --> 05:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
the two deputies good to see you all
 
05:10:53.270 --> 05:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:57.948 --> 05:10:57.958 align:start position:0%
all right Marty and company
 
05:11:02.390 --> 05:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:10.190 --> 05:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:13.010 --> 05:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for having us representative
 
05:11:15.050 --> 05:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
leishman with me today is Marie Mullin
 
05:11:17.150 --> 05:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
our Director of Finance who you may
 
05:11:19.850 --> 05:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
recognize from dot we were able to poach
 
05:11:23.570 --> 05:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
her this summer and we're very happy to
 
05:11:25.910 --> 05:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
be able to do that so what we have for
 
05:11:27.288 --> 05:11:27.298 align:start position:0%
you today and you've got the slides in
 
05:11:29.750 --> 05:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
front of you is a brief slide deck that
 
05:11:30.770 --> 05:11:30.780 align:start position:0%
we're just going to kind of walk through
 
05:11:33.110 --> 05:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
but use it as much as a jumping off
 
05:11:35.628 --> 05:11:35.638 align:start position:0%
point for questions or you know things
 
05:11:38.570 --> 05:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
that you want to explore further and
 
05:11:40.128 --> 05:11:40.138 align:start position:0%
it's it's similar to something we did
 
05:11:43.190 --> 05:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
for house Insanity DNA a few weeks ago
 
05:11:45.590 --> 05:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
if we are invited back to full Finance
 
05:11:46.850 --> 05:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
we'll give you a little bit longer
 
05:11:48.890 --> 05:11:48.900 align:start position:0%
version of this but we didn't want to
 
05:11:50.930 --> 05:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
bore you and give you the same thing
 
05:11:52.570 --> 05:11:52.580 align:start position:0%
twice uh
 
05:11:55.010 --> 05:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
so so with that I'm going to turn it
 
05:11:56.150 --> 05:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
over to Marie she's going to walk
 
05:11:58.368 --> 05:11:58.378 align:start position:0%
through the first half of the slides and
 
05:11:59.690 --> 05:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
then I'll take the second and there's
 
05:12:01.550 --> 05:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
some appendix slides at the end that
 
05:12:04.010 --> 05:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
we're not going to cover but um we may
 
05:12:06.050 --> 05:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
reference if the question comes up and
 
05:12:08.930 --> 05:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:12.110 --> 05:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
all right well good afternoon everyone
 
05:12:14.690 --> 05:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
so let's um start out with the contents
 
05:12:17.208 --> 05:12:17.218 align:start position:0%
we'll do an overview of our membership
 
05:12:19.270 --> 05:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
and benefits the Investments
 
05:12:22.430 --> 05:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
contributions and funding legislation
 
05:12:25.128 --> 05:12:25.138 align:start position:0%
and a summary and again as Marty
 
05:12:28.128 --> 05:12:28.138 align:start position:0%
mentioned their appendices at the end
 
05:12:31.430 --> 05:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
so for the high level overview New
 
05:12:32.990 --> 05:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system is a
 
05:12:35.448 --> 05:12:35.458 align:start position:0%
contribute contributory multi-employer
 
05:12:37.910 --> 05:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
defined benefit defined benefit plan
 
05:12:40.910 --> 05:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
established in 1967. it provides
 
05:12:43.010 --> 05:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
retirement disability and death benefits
 
05:12:45.850 --> 05:12:45.860 align:start position:0%
death benefits as well as
 
05:12:48.708 --> 05:12:48.718 align:start position:0%
post-retirement medical subsidies to
 
05:12:51.050 --> 05:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
eligible members and beneficiaries
 
05:12:51.060 --> 05:12:52.250 align:start position:0%
eligible members and beneficiaries
so

05:12:52.250 --> 05:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:12:53.810 --> 05:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
you're you're familiar with most
 
05:12:57.050 --> 05:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
retirement plans at the defined benefit
 
05:12:58.788 --> 05:12:58.798 align:start position:0%
plan is is a little different where the
 
05:13:01.310 --> 05:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
disability and death benefits are not
 
05:13:03.170 --> 05:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
part of most retirement plans but they
 
05:13:06.170 --> 05:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
are part of the retirement system plans
 
05:13:08.690 --> 05:13:08.700 align:start position:0%
so once members attain eligibility they
 
05:13:10.430 --> 05:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
can receive a guaranteed lifetime
 
05:13:10.440 --> 05:13:11.868 align:start position:0%
can receive a guaranteed lifetime
pension

05:13:11.868 --> 05:13:11.878 align:start position:0%
pension
 
05:13:14.208 --> 05:13:14.218 align:start position:0%
and their benefits are funded through
 
05:13:17.690 --> 05:13:17.700 align:start position:0%
employee and employer contributions
 
05:13:20.930 --> 05:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
and and investment income
 
05:13:20.940 --> 05:13:23.090 align:start position:0%
and and investment income
so

05:13:23.090 --> 05:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:13:25.910 --> 05:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
because we have a qualified plan that
 
05:13:28.490 --> 05:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
means that the the contributions that
 
05:13:32.330 --> 05:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
employees pay are pre-tax and are only
 
05:13:36.530 --> 05:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:39.230 --> 05:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
on slide four
 
05:13:41.208 --> 05:13:41.218 align:start position:0%
uh the New Hampshire retirement system
 
05:13:43.310 --> 05:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
is a component unit of the state
 
05:13:45.890 --> 05:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
government so we're not an executive
 
05:13:47.750 --> 05:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
agency of the state we are a component
 
05:13:50.030 --> 05:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
unit and it's overseen by a Board of
 
05:13:50.040 --> 05:13:52.010 align:start position:0%
unit and it's overseen by a Board of
Trustees

05:13:52.010 --> 05:13:52.020 align:start position:0%
Trustees
 
05:13:53.570 --> 05:13:53.580 align:start position:0%
the Board of Trustees and the
 
05:13:55.190 --> 05:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
independent investment committee are
 
05:13:58.430 --> 05:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
fiduciaries so as far as fiduciaries we
 
05:14:01.610 --> 05:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
are required both employees of the
 
05:14:03.230 --> 05:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
retirement system and the board and
 
05:14:05.330 --> 05:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
independent investment committee we are
 
05:14:07.788 --> 05:14:07.798 align:start position:0%
required to act in the best interest of
 
05:14:10.610 --> 05:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
the members and retirees always not in
 
05:14:13.128 --> 05:14:13.138 align:start position:0%
our own self-interests but always in the
 
05:14:17.270 --> 05:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the retirees
 
05:14:20.570 --> 05:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
the legislature is the plan sponsor and
 
05:14:24.830 --> 05:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
all of our rsas are under RSA 100a
 
05:14:27.708 --> 05:14:27.718 align:start position:0%
and our staff implements the statutes
 
05:14:29.690 --> 05:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
rules and policies as well as the
 
05:14:32.628 --> 05:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:35.090 --> 05:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
one of the most important
 
05:14:35.100 --> 05:14:35.750 align:start position:0%
one of the most important
um

05:14:35.750 --> 05:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:37.910 --> 05:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
legislative pieces here is that under
 
05:14:40.490 --> 05:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
article 36a of the Constitution
 
05:14:42.650 --> 05:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
These funds are protected for the
 
05:14:45.470 --> 05:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
exclusive purpose of providing benefits
 
05:14:47.510 --> 05:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
to the retirement to the retirements and
 
05:14:49.970 --> 05:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
the retirees and it requires the board
 
05:14:52.970 --> 05:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
to certify employer rates based on sound
 
05:14:56.090 --> 05:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
Actuarial practice as well as requiring
 
05:14:58.490 --> 05:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
employers to pay the rates that are
 
05:15:00.650 --> 05:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
certified so that is all in the New
 
05:15:04.010 --> 05:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:05.690 --> 05:15:05.700 align:start position:0%
Slide Five
 
05:15:09.110 --> 05:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
this is a general overall of how the
 
05:15:12.530 --> 05:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
plan is funded so the contributions from
 
05:15:16.030 --> 05:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
members and retire and employers
 
05:15:19.010 --> 05:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
plus the investment income we get from
 
05:15:21.470 --> 05:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
investing those funds
 
05:15:24.590 --> 05:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
go into the trust fund and then from
 
05:15:26.448 --> 05:15:26.458 align:start position:0%
that those funds in the trust fund
 
05:15:29.868 --> 05:15:29.878 align:start position:0%
benefit payments and expenses go out
 
05:15:32.750 --> 05:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
so that equation must balance in the
 
05:15:34.550 --> 05:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
long term so over the long term so in
 
05:15:37.610 --> 05:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
one individual year you may not have
 
05:15:39.948 --> 05:15:39.958 align:start position:0%
that balance but over the long term with
 
05:15:42.470 --> 05:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
the investment returns and the
 
05:15:44.330 --> 05:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
contributions we're receiving it is
 
05:15:47.030 --> 05:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
anticipated that they will equal and
 
05:15:49.930 --> 05:15:49.940 align:start position:0%
that it will it does balance out
 
05:15:53.150 --> 05:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
currently as of June 30th 22 end of
 
05:15:56.208 --> 05:15:56.218 align:start position:0%
fiscal year the trust fund had 10.75
 
05:15:59.150 --> 05:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
billion available funds in there to be
 
05:15:59.160 --> 05:16:01.368 align:start position:0%
billion available funds in there to be
invested

05:16:01.368 --> 05:16:01.378 align:start position:0%
invested
 
05:16:04.250 --> 05:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
the next slide slide six is a is a graph
 
05:16:06.490 --> 05:16:06.500 align:start position:0%
showing you over the past 12 years
 
05:16:09.230 --> 05:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
basically from 2010
 
05:16:11.448 --> 05:16:11.458 align:start position:0%
which was when the state started the
 
05:16:13.490 --> 05:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
30-year amortization of the unfunded
 
05:16:16.730 --> 05:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
liability you can see the the balance in
 
05:16:19.250 --> 05:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
the the assets of the trust fund have
 
05:16:22.430 --> 05:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
gradually increased over that time based
 
05:16:24.650 --> 05:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
on investments and some of the changes
 
05:16:28.010 --> 05:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
that were made in 2010 to the the actual
 
05:16:28.020 --> 05:16:31.910 align:start position:0%
that were made in 2010 to the the actual
assumptions

05:16:31.910 --> 05:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:33.770 --> 05:16:33.780 align:start position:0%
on slide seven
 
05:16:36.708 --> 05:16:36.718 align:start position:0%
the the membership of the the retirees
 
05:16:38.510 --> 05:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
and the and the members is made up of
 
05:16:40.250 --> 05:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
two groups so there's group one which
 
05:16:42.590 --> 05:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
make up the employees and the teachers
 
05:16:46.010 --> 05:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
group two is police and fire
 
05:16:49.550 --> 05:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
we have 461 active participating
 
05:16:53.448 --> 05:16:53.458 align:start position:0%
employers all around the state
 
05:16:56.510 --> 05:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
originally the state employees were were
 
05:16:58.610 --> 05:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
part of where the retirement system and
 
05:17:01.850 --> 05:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
then in 1967 it was Consolidated and
 
05:17:03.830 --> 05:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities were given the choice to
 
05:17:06.230 --> 05:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
join and most most do join the
 
05:17:08.510 --> 05:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
05:17:11.030 --> 05:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
um the unfunded Actuarial liability is
 
05:17:13.128 --> 05:17:13.138 align:start position:0%
paid by the employers over time
 
05:17:15.890 --> 05:17:15.900 align:start position:0%
currently and Marty will discuss that
 
05:17:18.170 --> 05:17:18.180 align:start position:0%
later in the presentation and how that
 
05:17:20.448 --> 05:17:20.458 align:start position:0%
has come about
 
05:17:23.810 --> 05:17:23.820 align:start position:0%
on slide eight we have some statistics
 
05:17:26.208 --> 05:17:26.218 align:start position:0%
on our as of June 30th of our current
 
05:17:29.990 --> 05:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
membership both active and retirees as
 
05:17:31.910 --> 05:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
far as our active membership that hasn't
 
05:17:33.708 --> 05:17:33.718 align:start position:0%
remained pretty consistent over the past
 
05:17:36.110 --> 05:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
10 years we don't see a lot of
 
05:17:38.090 --> 05:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
fluctuation in that total number of the
 
05:17:41.930 --> 05:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
48 000 however the retirees have
 
05:17:44.810 --> 05:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
increased during that time frame and
 
05:17:48.350 --> 05:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
since 2013 the number of retirees has
 
05:17:50.270 --> 05:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
increased 43 percent
 
05:17:53.690 --> 05:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
so when you're looking at that that grid
 
05:17:55.490 --> 05:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
before of the funds coming in to cover
 
05:17:57.170 --> 05:17:57.180 align:start position:0%
the expenses
 
05:17:59.390 --> 05:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
the the active membership has remained
 
05:18:00.650 --> 05:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
the same but you're seeing the number of
 
05:18:02.270 --> 05:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
retirees increase so you're going to
 
05:18:04.970 --> 05:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
have that additional pull on the funds
 
05:18:07.610 --> 05:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
to be paying these retirees but your
 
05:18:09.830 --> 05:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
contributions coming in from that
 
05:18:15.948 --> 05:18:15.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:17.628 --> 05:18:17.638 align:start position:0%
wasn't that black
 
05:18:20.030 --> 05:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
um when that gets when the actuaries
 
05:18:22.670 --> 05:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
review that will that cause a
 
05:18:26.930 --> 05:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
significant spike in uh fees or the cost
 
05:18:30.670 --> 05:18:30.680 align:start position:0%
of the plan the contributions required
 
05:18:33.050 --> 05:18:33.060 align:start position:0%
that's already factored into the current
 
05:18:34.970 --> 05:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
rates and then into the rates going
 
05:18:37.430 --> 05:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
forward as as part of the overall that's
 
05:18:40.970 --> 05:18:40.980 align:start position:0%
you know um you know ideally if if in a
 
05:18:42.890 --> 05:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
perfect world if we were fully funded
 
05:18:44.810 --> 05:18:44.820 align:start position:0%
the rates would be much lower but and
 
05:18:46.490 --> 05:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
the active members would be pre-funding
 
05:18:47.990 --> 05:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
and the employees would be pre-funding
 
05:18:50.650 --> 05:18:50.660 align:start position:0%
the benefits as they accrue so that
 
05:18:53.570 --> 05:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
growing retiree population is a factor
 
05:18:55.010 --> 05:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
in the assumptions and you know there's
 
05:18:57.770 --> 05:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
a you know retirement rates and and all
 
05:18:59.208 --> 05:18:59.218 align:start position:0%
kinds of different assumptions tied to
 
05:19:00.590 --> 05:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
that that
 
05:19:03.170 --> 05:19:03.180 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't by itself Drive the rates
 
05:19:03.180 --> 05:19:04.190 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't by itself Drive the rates
up

05:19:04.190 --> 05:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:19:06.890 --> 05:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
because it's already cooked in
 
05:19:15.110 --> 05:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:18.110 --> 05:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
okay and over to slide nine
 
05:19:22.010 --> 05:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
um in fiscal year 22 uh the retirement
 
05:19:24.948 --> 05:19:24.958 align:start position:0%
system paid out 914 million in benefits
 
05:19:27.470 --> 05:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
to retirees and beneficiaries
 
05:19:30.170 --> 05:19:30.180 align:start position:0%
in that same period we paid out 43.8
 
05:19:32.270 --> 05:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
million to our related to the
 
05:19:35.270 --> 05:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
post-retirement medical subsidy
 
05:19:36.708 --> 05:19:36.718 align:start position:0%
um just some information on that medical
 
05:19:39.128 --> 05:19:39.138 align:start position:0%
subsidy program that is a closed program
 
05:19:42.410 --> 05:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
and that will decrease over time right
 
05:19:44.330 --> 05:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
currently there's a little over 90 100
 
05:19:48.410 --> 05:19:48.420 align:start position:0%
retirees in that plan and as
 
05:19:50.868 --> 05:19:50.878 align:start position:0%
um those retirees
 
05:19:52.128 --> 05:19:52.138 align:start position:0%
are deceased and they don't have
 
05:19:54.050 --> 05:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries then that medical subsidy
 
05:19:56.868 --> 05:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
will will go down
 
05:19:59.690 --> 05:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
currently approximately 80 percent of
 
05:20:01.730 --> 05:20:01.740 align:start position:0%
retirees and beneficiaries remain in New
 
05:20:04.310 --> 05:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so those those funds are
 
05:20:06.288 --> 05:20:06.298 align:start position:0%
staying to support the economy of New
 
05:20:08.868 --> 05:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in our summary act for
 
05:20:10.850 --> 05:20:10.860 align:start position:0%
online and some of you may have picked
 
05:20:12.410 --> 05:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
up I think Marty has left some in some
 
05:20:14.448 --> 05:20:14.458 align:start position:0%
of the rooms but we do have a breakdown
 
05:20:16.990 --> 05:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
by County as well so you can see that
 
05:20:19.490 --> 05:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
Financial impact to each of the counties
 
05:20:21.288 --> 05:20:21.298 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of the pension and
 
05:20:24.230 --> 05:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
where where those funds are located
 
05:20:26.270 --> 05:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
I will turn it over now to Marty to
 
05:20:28.128 --> 05:20:28.138 align:start position:0%
start with slide 10.
 
05:20:31.070 --> 05:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Marie um so membership and
 
05:20:32.868 --> 05:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
benefits and and I I know this is
 
05:20:34.670 --> 05:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
repetitive for some folks who've been
 
05:20:36.650 --> 05:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
here a while and we don't want to put
 
05:20:38.930 --> 05:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
you to sleep but there are some newer
 
05:20:40.910 --> 05:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
folks involved with the retirement issue
 
05:20:42.590 --> 05:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
so we would start right at the beginning
 
05:20:44.090 --> 05:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
there are four types of retirement
 
05:20:46.990 --> 05:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
benefits provided by nhrs service
 
05:20:50.330 --> 05:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
disability early invested deferred
 
05:20:52.430 --> 05:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
Service retirement is by far the most
 
05:20:54.410 --> 05:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
common you're old enough you've worked
 
05:20:56.030 --> 05:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
long enough and you put in your
 
05:20:57.770 --> 05:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
paperwork and You Begin collecting your
 
05:21:00.830 --> 05:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
benefit of more than 80 85 percent of
 
05:21:03.890 --> 05:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
our retirees are service retirees uh
 
05:21:05.628 --> 05:21:05.638 align:start position:0%
disability retirement there are two
 
05:21:08.448 --> 05:21:08.458 align:start position:0%
types available in the statute one is
 
05:21:10.550 --> 05:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
job related and one is non-job-related
 
05:21:12.650 --> 05:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
and there's different eligibilities and
 
05:21:14.208 --> 05:21:14.218 align:start position:0%
benefits depending on the type of
 
05:21:14.218 --> 05:21:15.470 align:start position:0%
benefits depending on the type of
disability

05:21:15.470 --> 05:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
disability
 
05:21:17.948 --> 05:21:17.958 align:start position:0%
um you know but any anybody who is
 
05:21:20.390 --> 05:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
permanently injured on the job even on
 
05:21:22.250 --> 05:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
you know the second day of their career
 
05:21:24.948 --> 05:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
would be able for uh receive an
 
05:21:26.868 --> 05:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
accidental job-related disability
 
05:21:29.448 --> 05:21:29.458 align:start position:0%
benefit so the be non-job related you
 
05:21:31.010 --> 05:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
need to have 10 years in the system to
 
05:21:34.010 --> 05:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
qualify early retirement is there are
 
05:21:35.750 --> 05:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
Provisions in the statute that allow
 
05:21:38.868 --> 05:21:38.878 align:start position:0%
people once they reach a certain age and
 
05:21:41.150 --> 05:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
number of years of service they can take
 
05:21:43.128 --> 05:21:43.138 align:start position:0%
a reduced benefit prior to their full
 
05:21:45.650 --> 05:21:45.660 align:start position:0%
retirement age in the statute and that's
 
05:21:47.448 --> 05:21:47.458 align:start position:0%
a permanent reduction that would carry
 
05:21:49.550 --> 05:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
over one stage into full retirement age
 
05:21:50.530 --> 05:21:50.540 align:start position:0%
as well
 
05:21:52.970 --> 05:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
not a lot of people do that but it is an
 
05:21:55.010 --> 05:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
option and then that's the Deferred
 
05:21:56.810 --> 05:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
retirement this is a type of retirement
 
05:21:59.090 --> 05:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
where somebody has worked 10 or more
 
05:22:01.368 --> 05:22:01.378 align:start position:0%
years with nhrs regardless you know
 
05:22:04.550 --> 05:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
between 25 and 35 or 40 and 50 whatever
 
05:22:06.770 --> 05:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
you know they take another position or
 
05:22:08.330 --> 05:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
do something else so they're no longer
 
05:22:10.730 --> 05:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
an active employee member or you know
 
05:22:12.350 --> 05:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
any active member of the retirement
 
05:22:14.690 --> 05:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
system they keep their funds that they
 
05:22:16.368 --> 05:22:16.378 align:start position:0%
contributed with the retirement system
 
05:22:17.930 --> 05:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
and they can come back to us when they
 
05:22:20.208 --> 05:22:20.218 align:start position:0%
age into retirement eligibility and
 
05:22:21.948 --> 05:22:21.958 align:start position:0%
collect a pension based on those prior
 
05:22:23.750 --> 05:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
years of service it's obviously going to
 
05:22:25.128 --> 05:22:25.138 align:start position:0%
be a smaller pension than somebody who
 
05:22:27.350 --> 05:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
worked a full career but that is an
 
05:22:30.230 --> 05:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
option for some of our members to choose
 
05:22:30.240 --> 05:22:31.330 align:start position:0%
option for some of our members to choose
that

05:22:31.330 --> 05:22:31.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:22:33.830 --> 05:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
there are different benefit Provisions
 
05:22:35.690 --> 05:22:35.700 align:start position:0%
in the statute for group one and for
 
05:22:37.190 --> 05:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
group two and that that's always been
 
05:22:39.350 --> 05:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
the case since the plan was set up and
 
05:22:43.070 --> 05:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
Consolidated back in the 60s however due
 
05:22:46.550 --> 05:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
to some legislative changes in 2011 now
 
05:22:47.990 --> 05:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
there are different benefit Provisions
 
05:22:50.330 --> 05:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
or tiers if you will within each of
 
05:22:53.510 --> 05:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
those two groups there's three tiers uh
 
05:22:56.270 --> 05:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
you know members who were vested prior
 
05:22:59.030 --> 05:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
to January 1st of 2012 have certain
 
05:23:01.368 --> 05:23:01.378 align:start position:0%
benefit provisions and certain pay types
 
05:23:04.368 --> 05:23:04.378 align:start position:0%
are counted in their pension members who
 
05:23:06.770 --> 05:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
are in the retirement system prior to
 
05:23:10.850 --> 05:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
July 1st of 2011 but not vested prior to
 
05:23:13.610 --> 05:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
January 1st of 12 or sort of a middle
 
05:23:16.250 --> 05:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
group and then anyone hired on or after
 
05:23:19.910 --> 05:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
July 1st of 2011 is in is in the the
 
05:23:22.810 --> 05:23:22.820 align:start position:0%
third tier and is you know basically the
 
05:23:25.070 --> 05:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
formulas change a little bit the age
 
05:23:26.868 --> 05:23:26.878 align:start position:0%
requirements change a little bit for
 
05:23:29.030 --> 05:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
those people who the farther away from
 
05:23:31.670 --> 05:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
the original vested cohort in those
 
05:23:33.470 --> 05:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
stats in the Statue where we were
 
05:23:36.590 --> 05:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
starting to roll out referring to these
 
05:23:38.390 --> 05:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
rather than the long-winded string of
 
05:23:41.030 --> 05:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
dates as tier a b and c
 
05:23:44.470 --> 05:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
um you know for for brevity and uh
 
05:23:49.310 --> 05:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
you know um those reasons like that so
 
05:23:51.770 --> 05:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
um regardless of what tier someone's in
 
05:23:53.750 --> 05:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
though their benefits are determined
 
05:23:56.270 --> 05:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
based under statutory formulas and the
 
05:23:58.310 --> 05:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
the key components of the formulas are
 
05:24:00.288 --> 05:24:00.298 align:start position:0%
creditable service how long did someone
 
05:24:03.650 --> 05:24:03.660 align:start position:0%
work average final compensation and
 
05:24:03.660 --> 05:24:04.850 align:start position:0%
work average final compensation and
that's

05:24:04.850 --> 05:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:24:06.350 --> 05:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
um going to be someone's either their
 
05:24:09.410 --> 05:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
highest three or highest five years of
 
05:24:11.810 --> 05:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
um earnable compensation with a
 
05:24:14.030 --> 05:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
retirement system employer and earnable
 
05:24:16.250 --> 05:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
compensation was also changed along the
 
05:24:19.190 --> 05:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
way so some pay types are count for the
 
05:24:21.590 --> 05:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
the older tra members and don't count
 
05:24:24.530 --> 05:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
for members in the lower tiers but it's
 
05:24:26.390 --> 05:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know we it's either a three or five
 
05:24:28.610 --> 05:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
year average and then a benefit
 
05:24:31.128 --> 05:24:31.138 align:start position:0%
multiplier it's basically formulas to
 
05:24:33.890 --> 05:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
derive the pension based on you know AFC
 
05:24:37.070 --> 05:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
time service divided by or multiplied by
 
05:24:39.770 --> 05:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
X and those those multipliers are
 
05:24:41.930 --> 05:24:41.940 align:start position:0%
different between group one and group
 
05:24:43.250 --> 05:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
two and this the six different
 
05:24:45.708 --> 05:24:45.718 align:start position:0%
multipliers in group two depending on
 
05:24:48.530 --> 05:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
where they fall on transition ladder at
 
05:24:50.030 --> 05:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
the time of the legislative changes so
 
05:24:51.830 --> 05:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's a at the end the appendix is
 
05:24:53.690 --> 05:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
sample calculations for what it would
 
05:24:55.788 --> 05:24:55.798 align:start position:0%
look like for a group one and a group
 
05:24:58.550 --> 05:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
two membered hired after uh July 1st of
 
05:25:00.590 --> 05:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
11 just for reference I mean typically
 
05:25:03.288 --> 05:25:03.298 align:start position:0%
this committee isn't in the Weeds on
 
05:25:04.970 --> 05:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
that side you're it's already gone
 
05:25:06.350 --> 05:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
through a policy committee and you're
 
05:25:08.208 --> 05:25:08.218 align:start position:0%
looking at the numbers but just wanted
 
05:25:10.128 --> 05:25:10.138 align:start position:0%
to kind of do a brief overview of how
 
05:25:11.990 --> 05:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
that all works
 
05:25:15.110 --> 05:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
if you turn to slide 11 this is just a
 
05:25:17.090 --> 05:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
sort of a distribution of benefits by
 
05:25:17.100 --> 05:25:18.590 align:start position:0%
sort of a distribution of benefits by
amount

05:25:18.590 --> 05:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
amount
 
05:25:21.110 --> 05:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
um you know the average benefit on one
 
05:25:24.770 --> 05:25:24.780 align:start position:0%
of Marie's slides was 21 862
 
05:25:27.410 --> 05:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
um you know on average for the the 42
 
05:25:29.628 --> 05:25:29.638 align:start position:0%
000 recipients
 
05:25:32.390 --> 05:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
um take that number 26 percent see a
 
05:25:35.570 --> 05:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
benefit of under 10 000 a year uh 64
 
05:25:37.670 --> 05:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's under 25
 
05:25:40.190 --> 05:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
000 on an annual basis 93 of our
 
05:25:42.110 --> 05:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
retirees and beneficiaries and benefits
 
05:25:44.930 --> 05:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
under fifty thousand uh they were or
 
05:25:48.230 --> 05:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
higher uh pension retirees those making
 
05:25:50.510 --> 05:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
more than 75 000 is a little bit less
 
05:25:52.448 --> 05:25:52.458 align:start position:0%
than two percent of the total population
 
05:25:56.690 --> 05:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
uh those folks tend to be uh people who
 
05:25:59.208 --> 05:25:59.218 align:start position:0%
work for a large number of years you
 
05:26:01.310 --> 05:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
know in a you know in certainly at least
 
05:26:03.470 --> 05:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
their final years were more lucrative in
 
05:26:04.970 --> 05:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
the job they probably acquired more
 
05:26:07.190 --> 05:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities along the line uh
 
05:26:08.868 --> 05:26:08.878 align:start position:0%
things like that so you know the the
 
05:26:10.550 --> 05:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
calculations the same for everyone
 
05:26:12.590 --> 05:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of what they're all that the
 
05:26:14.990 --> 05:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
benefit is there already scheduled
 
05:26:18.110 --> 05:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
special calcs I'm not sure if we cut it
 
05:26:19.430 --> 05:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
out of here I think we may have but
 
05:26:20.570 --> 05:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
there's a there is a benefit
 
05:26:22.850 --> 05:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
distribution by
 
05:26:26.030 --> 05:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
um by member group The 21862 is an
 
05:26:26.040 --> 05:26:27.410 align:start position:0%
um by member group The 21862 is an
aggregate

05:26:27.410 --> 05:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
aggregate
 
05:26:27.420 --> 05:26:28.128 align:start position:0%
aggregate
um

05:26:28.128 --> 05:26:28.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:31.190 --> 05:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
roughly speaking in an average retired
 
05:26:32.750 --> 05:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
employee the annual benefits about
 
05:26:34.910 --> 05:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand
 
05:26:36.770 --> 05:26:36.780 align:start position:0%
um I think it's about 23 and a half for
 
05:26:39.050 --> 05:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
a retired teacher somewhere in the
 
05:26:42.350 --> 05:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
vicinity of 38 or 39 for the retired
 
05:26:45.530 --> 05:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
firefighter and a little bit over 40 for
 
05:26:47.628 --> 05:26:47.638 align:start position:0%
a retired
 
05:26:49.670 --> 05:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
um firefighter
 
05:26:54.170 --> 05:26:54.180 align:start position:0%
yeah 39 189 for police and 44 350 for
 
05:26:56.510 --> 05:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
fire and one of the reasons in this
 
05:26:58.490 --> 05:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler mentioned this uh
 
05:27:00.530 --> 05:27:00.540 align:start position:0%
yesterday but one of the reasons the the
 
05:27:02.090 --> 05:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
fire benefit is a little bit higher than
 
05:27:03.970 --> 05:27:03.980 align:start position:0%
the police benefit is they they
 
05:27:06.110 --> 05:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
firefighters tend to retire with an
 
05:27:07.550 --> 05:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
average of two or three more years of
 
05:27:13.430 --> 05:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:17.330 --> 05:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
so slide 12 Investments this just talks
 
05:27:19.010 --> 05:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
about the structure of how the
 
05:27:21.050 --> 05:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
Investments are managed by nhrs the
 
05:27:23.868 --> 05:27:23.878 align:start position:0%
board has a very high level
 
05:27:26.448 --> 05:27:26.458 align:start position:0%
um uh function with with Investments
 
05:27:28.208 --> 05:27:28.218 align:start position:0%
they're not involved in the direct
 
05:27:30.890 --> 05:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
operation they approve an investment
 
05:27:33.410 --> 05:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
policy including an asset allocation how
 
05:27:35.810 --> 05:27:35.820 align:start position:0%
much are we comfortable allocating to
 
05:27:38.030 --> 05:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
you know U.S Equity domestic Equity
 
05:27:40.010 --> 05:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
fixed income real estate
 
05:27:40.020 --> 05:27:41.208 align:start position:0%
fixed income real estate
Etc

05:27:41.208 --> 05:27:41.218 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
05:27:43.850 --> 05:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
um and we have an independent investment
 
05:27:45.948 --> 05:27:45.958 align:start position:0%
committee and that was created by
 
05:27:48.948 --> 05:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
legislation and the committee um
 
05:27:51.650 --> 05:27:51.660 align:start position:0%
took effect uh January 1 of 09 so
 
05:27:53.208 --> 05:27:53.218 align:start position:0%
they've been around for a number of
 
05:27:54.590 --> 05:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
years now and have had a successful
 
05:27:56.628 --> 05:27:56.638 align:start position:0%
track record they recommend the
 
05:27:58.610 --> 05:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
investment policy and investment
 
05:28:01.070 --> 05:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
consultant for the board to review and
 
05:28:02.930 --> 05:28:02.940 align:start position:0%
they're the they're the group that meets
 
05:28:04.970 --> 05:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
monthly and oversees the administrating
 
05:28:07.128 --> 05:28:07.138 align:start position:0%
the investment program they basically
 
05:28:08.690 --> 05:28:08.700 align:start position:0%
you know do the hiring and firing of
 
05:28:08.700 --> 05:28:10.368 align:start position:0%
you know do the hiring and firing of
providers

05:28:10.368 --> 05:28:10.378 align:start position:0%
providers
 
05:28:12.050 --> 05:28:12.060 align:start position:0%
um you know if we want to go into a
 
05:28:13.850 --> 05:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
we're changing the allocation or there's
 
05:28:15.590 --> 05:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
an underperforming manager we'll let
 
05:28:18.530 --> 05:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
them go or a re-up uh with somebody that
 
05:28:20.690 --> 05:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
we're happy with so they're the the
 
05:28:24.170 --> 05:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
working groups uh in terms of investment
 
05:28:27.050 --> 05:28:27.060 align:start position:0%
they also prepare with staff the
 
05:28:29.030 --> 05:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
comprehensive annual investment report
 
05:28:31.010 --> 05:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
and there's a dropped a copy of that off
 
05:28:33.050 --> 05:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
and Ms clayman's office across the way
 
05:28:35.390 --> 05:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh yesterday
 
05:28:37.430 --> 05:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
um both the board and independent
 
05:28:39.410 --> 05:28:39.420 align:start position:0%
investment committees are fiduciaries as
 
05:28:41.868 --> 05:28:41.878 align:start position:0%
Marie mentioned as they're listed in the
 
05:28:44.330 --> 05:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
appendix both the board membership and
 
05:28:47.868 --> 05:28:47.878 align:start position:0%
the iic the iic is separate from the
 
05:28:49.670 --> 05:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
board there are two trustee members of
 
05:28:55.390 --> 05:28:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:58.788 --> 05:28:58.798 align:start position:0%
in a sixth member who's an active member
 
05:29:00.830 --> 05:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
of the retirement system
 
05:29:04.070 --> 05:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
so when everyone on there has to have uh
 
05:29:06.230 --> 05:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
some experience an Institutional
 
05:29:08.090 --> 05:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
investment or public finances or
 
05:29:10.010 --> 05:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
requirements so
 
05:29:12.050 --> 05:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
um you know that they've proven pretty
 
05:29:14.390 --> 05:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
successful over time
 
05:29:17.390 --> 05:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
um slide 13 just shows the investment
 
05:29:20.868 --> 05:29:20.878 align:start position:0%
returns as of June 30th of 2022 the
 
05:29:23.270 --> 05:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
one-year return ending last June 30th
 
05:29:25.190 --> 05:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
was minus 6.1 that was our first
 
05:29:26.810 --> 05:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
negative number since the Great
 
05:29:26.820 --> 05:29:28.490 align:start position:0%
negative number since the Great
Recession

05:29:28.490 --> 05:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
Recession
 
05:29:30.410 --> 05:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
um and you know it's called Comfort to
 
05:29:31.970 --> 05:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
say we beat our Benchmark which was
 
05:29:35.868 --> 05:29:35.878 align:start position:0%
minus 9.3 uh but
 
05:29:37.970 --> 05:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
um when you look at the you know the 3 5
 
05:29:42.948 --> 05:29:42.958 align:start position:0%
10 and 25 year returns you know they are
 
05:29:45.288 --> 05:29:45.298 align:start position:0%
above our current assumed rate of return
 
05:29:47.090 --> 05:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
and tracking in a good direction the
 
05:29:51.470 --> 05:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
prior year fiscal 21 uh we we had a 29.4
 
05:29:52.910 --> 05:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
return which may have been the highest
 
05:29:55.070 --> 05:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
we've ever had so
 
05:29:57.230 --> 05:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
um this is a good time to talk about
 
05:29:59.270 --> 05:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
Actuarial smoothing
 
05:30:02.270 --> 05:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
um and the next slide shows the return
 
05:30:08.030 --> 05:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
since 2007 on a year-over-year basis and
 
05:30:10.670 --> 05:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
there's a line that goes along with that
 
05:30:13.250 --> 05:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
in Gray and that represents five years
 
05:30:14.930 --> 05:30:14.940 align:start position:0%
smoothing of investment return and
 
05:30:17.030 --> 05:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's how the actuary calculates the um
 
05:30:19.690 --> 05:30:19.700 align:start position:0%
the employer rates because if you
 
05:30:23.270 --> 05:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
based employer rates in fiscal 21 on we
 
05:30:24.830 --> 05:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
made two billion dollars isn't that
 
05:30:26.208 --> 05:30:26.218 align:start position:0%
great you know the rates would fall
 
05:30:28.190 --> 05:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
through the floor and then you have a
 
05:30:30.410 --> 05:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
minus here then they're gonna
 
05:30:34.250 --> 05:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
undulate wildly so um you know they uh
 
05:30:35.990 --> 05:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
and this is a fairly standard Actuarial
 
05:30:37.788 --> 05:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
practice some people do four years you
 
05:30:39.170 --> 05:30:39.180 align:start position:0%
know six years but you know the five
 
05:30:41.448 --> 05:30:41.458 align:start position:0%
years is the most common you know so so
 
05:30:42.890 --> 05:30:42.900 align:start position:0%
that's a rolling average you know one
 
05:30:44.810 --> 05:30:44.820 align:start position:0%
year drops off and the next year adds on
 
05:30:46.970 --> 05:30:46.980 align:start position:0%
uh for smoothing and you think that that
 
05:30:49.670 --> 05:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
line is much straighter and more stable
 
05:30:51.770 --> 05:30:51.780 align:start position:0%
you know than the ups and downs you know
 
05:30:53.570 --> 05:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
in the year over year with the markets
 
05:30:57.170 --> 05:30:57.180 align:start position:0%
so so that that's how smoothing works so
 
05:30:57.180 --> 05:30:58.788 align:start position:0%
so so that that's how smoothing works so
um

05:30:58.788 --> 05:30:58.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:00.770 --> 05:31:00.780 align:start position:0%
you know and it's been very beneficial
 
05:31:04.368 --> 05:31:04.378 align:start position:0%
because of the five years ending uh June
 
05:31:06.590 --> 05:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
30th of 21.
 
05:31:06.600 --> 05:31:07.490 align:start position:0%
30th of 21.
um

05:31:07.490 --> 05:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:09.530 --> 05:31:09.540 align:start position:0%
were were above the assumed rate of
 
05:31:12.230 --> 05:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
return it was a you know that helped uh
 
05:31:14.628 --> 05:31:14.638 align:start position:0%
reduce employer rates slightly
 
05:31:18.288 --> 05:31:18.298 align:start position:0%
um in the next next upcoming biennium
 
05:31:21.288 --> 05:31:21.298 align:start position:0%
so if you turn to slide 15 it's just a
 
05:31:24.288 --> 05:31:24.298 align:start position:0%
little um a little back padding uh by
 
05:31:24.298 --> 05:31:25.550 align:start position:0%
little um a little back padding uh by
nhrs

05:31:25.550 --> 05:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
nhrs
 
05:31:29.030 --> 05:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
um the performance uh through 622 was in
 
05:31:31.788 --> 05:31:31.798 align:start position:0%
the 80th percentile of of peer Public
 
05:31:33.650 --> 05:31:33.660 align:start position:0%
Employee Retirement plans of over a
 
05:31:36.110 --> 05:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
billion in assets uh over the last 10
 
05:31:36.120 --> 05:31:37.730 align:start position:0%
billion in assets uh over the last 10
years

05:31:37.730 --> 05:31:37.740 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:31:40.128 --> 05:31:40.138 align:start position:0%
um in over the 13 years since the iic
 
05:31:42.230 --> 05:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
was formed that were in the top 80
 
05:31:44.330 --> 05:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
percent as well
 
05:31:47.690 --> 05:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
um that our performance from 09 through
 
05:31:52.190 --> 05:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 represents 325 million in
 
05:31:53.868 --> 05:31:53.878 align:start position:0%
additional returns if we were just at
 
05:31:56.030 --> 05:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
the 50th percentile completely average
 
05:31:59.690 --> 05:31:59.700 align:start position:0%
you know we'd have 325 million less in
 
05:32:01.730 --> 05:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
the trust fund and you know some some
 
05:32:04.250 --> 05:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
years you are a genius in some years you
 
05:32:07.190 --> 05:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
look like a fool and it's they they need
 
05:32:07.200 --> 05:32:08.030 align:start position:0%
look like a fool and it's they they need
to

05:32:08.030 --> 05:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:32:09.830 --> 05:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
um you have thick skins and you know
 
05:32:11.628 --> 05:32:11.638 align:start position:0%
it's a lot that you know our we're a
 
05:32:13.610 --> 05:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
long-term investor so it's not like you
 
05:32:15.890 --> 05:32:15.900 align:start position:0%
know we're gonna you know buy and sell
 
05:32:17.690 --> 05:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
you know day trade and trade currencies
 
05:32:19.128 --> 05:32:19.138 align:start position:0%
I mean we're looking for Investments
 
05:32:21.230 --> 05:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
that can perform over the long term for
 
05:32:23.448 --> 05:32:23.458 align:start position:0%
the benefit of our members so some some
 
05:32:25.788 --> 05:32:25.798 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of diversification but
 
05:32:27.770 --> 05:32:27.780 align:start position:0%
they there there are years where you
 
05:32:30.170 --> 05:32:30.180 align:start position:0%
know sometimes the bear E2 and sometimes
 
05:32:31.670 --> 05:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
eat the bear
 
05:32:31.680 --> 05:32:32.448 align:start position:0%
eat the bear
um

05:32:32.448 --> 05:32:32.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:32.458 --> 05:32:33.830 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:32:33.830 --> 05:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:32:37.070 --> 05:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
um let's see let's let that move to
 
05:32:38.990 --> 05:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
slide 60 and this is contributions and
 
05:32:40.550 --> 05:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
this some questions came up yesterday
 
05:32:42.288 --> 05:32:42.298 align:start position:0%
about this
 
05:32:44.150 --> 05:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
um member contributions what what the
 
05:32:45.948 --> 05:32:45.958 align:start position:0%
active members put into the system are
 
05:32:48.170 --> 05:32:48.180 align:start position:0%
set by Statute
 
05:32:50.690 --> 05:32:50.700 align:start position:0%
um so um they're an RSA 100a employees
 
05:32:53.570 --> 05:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
and Teachers Pay seven percent of uh
 
05:32:54.948 --> 05:32:54.958 align:start position:0%
payroll of their
 
05:32:57.650 --> 05:32:57.660 align:start position:0%
printable compensation to the retirement
 
05:33:00.310 --> 05:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
system every pay period police it's
 
05:33:05.150 --> 05:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
11.55 in fire it's 11.8 the police and
 
05:33:06.530 --> 05:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
fire have always been higher
 
05:33:09.470 --> 05:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
contribution in part because uh Public
 
05:33:11.330 --> 05:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
Safety group two in New Hampshire does
 
05:33:13.910 --> 05:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
not participate in Social Security so
 
05:33:16.430 --> 05:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
neither the employer or the member you
 
05:33:18.230 --> 05:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
know put in that Social Security piece
 
05:33:19.730 --> 05:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:33:22.070 --> 05:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
almost all of our group one members
 
05:33:24.230 --> 05:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
employers are in Social Security there
 
05:33:25.970 --> 05:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
are a couple of exceptions that I'm
 
05:33:27.650 --> 05:33:27.660 align:start position:0%
aware of but um
 
05:33:28.850 --> 05:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
that that
 
05:33:28.860 --> 05:33:29.470 align:start position:0%
that that
um

05:33:29.470 --> 05:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:32.090 --> 05:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
that opted out of the plan before the
 
05:33:34.490 --> 05:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
federal law changed in the 80s to to
 
05:33:37.250 --> 05:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
make that no longer an option
 
05:33:40.128 --> 05:33:40.138 align:start position:0%
um employer contributions however are
 
05:33:43.910 --> 05:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
set actuarially so the actuary
 
05:33:46.910 --> 05:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
determines what the rates are required
 
05:33:49.010 --> 05:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
to be to keep funding the system and
 
05:33:50.330 --> 05:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
paying benefits and paying down the
 
05:33:52.550 --> 05:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
liability and then the board certifies
 
05:33:55.250 --> 05:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
those uh rates on a biennial basis so
 
05:33:57.110 --> 05:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
every two years
 
05:33:59.750 --> 05:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
um you know the actually does a
 
05:34:02.628 --> 05:34:02.638 align:start position:0%
valuation that develops the rates that
 
05:34:04.430 --> 05:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
goes to the board and it gets approved
 
05:34:05.810 --> 05:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
we um
 
05:34:08.570 --> 05:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
the statutorily we have to approve those
 
05:34:11.270 --> 05:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
no later than October 1st we had always
 
05:34:13.250 --> 05:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
been doing that in September but this
 
05:34:16.310 --> 05:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
year we accelerated the process to
 
05:34:18.650 --> 05:34:18.660 align:start position:0%
approve certify rates in July to give
 
05:34:20.390 --> 05:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
employers including the state more times
 
05:34:22.368 --> 05:34:22.378 align:start position:0%
to start building their budget
 
05:34:25.368 --> 05:34:25.378 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets for the next two years
 
05:34:27.590 --> 05:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
um you know local employers have paid
 
05:34:30.170 --> 05:34:30.180 align:start position:0%
100 of the contribution since 2011 with
 
05:34:33.590 --> 05:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
the exception of the HB 1221
 
05:34:35.510 --> 05:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement this year
 
05:34:38.330 --> 05:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
just sent that over to Melissa probably
 
05:34:40.610 --> 05:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
10 minutes before we left the office so
 
05:34:42.470 --> 05:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
you'll have that
 
05:34:43.730 --> 05:34:43.740 align:start position:0%
um that number I know representative
 
05:34:46.788 --> 05:34:46.798 align:start position:0%
Griffin asked for those yesterday
 
05:34:50.868 --> 05:34:50.878 align:start position:0%
um and um that that's sort of the basics
 
05:34:53.930 --> 05:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
on that and uh but the the employer rate
 
05:34:56.150 --> 05:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh as we move to slide 17 there are
 
05:34:57.708 --> 05:34:57.718 align:start position:0%
different components to the employer
 
05:34:57.718 --> 05:34:58.910 align:start position:0%
different components to the employer
rate

05:34:58.910 --> 05:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
rate
 
05:35:00.470 --> 05:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
um you know I like it liking it to a tax
 
05:35:02.030 --> 05:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
bill you got your town your county and
 
05:35:03.770 --> 05:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
your school it's not the same but
 
05:35:05.448 --> 05:35:05.458 align:start position:0%
mentally you look at the bottom line and
 
05:35:06.470 --> 05:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's what you're paying and that
 
05:35:08.208 --> 05:35:08.218 align:start position:0%
that's what matters but there are pieces
 
05:35:10.788 --> 05:35:10.798 align:start position:0%
that flow into that uh the first is the
 
05:35:13.128 --> 05:35:13.138 align:start position:0%
normal cost and this is the estimated
 
05:35:15.170 --> 05:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
annual cost of pension benefits as
 
05:35:18.110 --> 05:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
they're earned so this is the the seven
 
05:35:20.448 --> 05:35:20.458 align:start position:0%
percent or eleven plus percent that the
 
05:35:22.368 --> 05:35:22.378 align:start position:0%
members are putting in that's all going
 
05:35:24.288 --> 05:35:24.298 align:start position:0%
to pre-fund their own benefit and then
 
05:35:25.670 --> 05:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
the difference
 
05:35:28.430 --> 05:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
above the statutory rates for the member
 
05:35:30.170 --> 05:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
the employer picks up that portion of
 
05:35:31.730 --> 05:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
the normal cost and then the next slide
 
05:35:34.010 --> 05:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
will kind of show how much that is uh
 
05:35:35.270 --> 05:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to skip to the bottom of
 
05:35:37.368 --> 05:35:37.378 align:start position:0%
this slide first and say medical subsidy
 
05:35:38.868 --> 05:35:38.878 align:start position:0%
and this is as Marie mentioned it's a
 
05:35:41.628 --> 05:35:41.638 align:start position:0%
closed plan sort of a legacy benefit uh
 
05:35:43.970 --> 05:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
that offsets insurance premiums for
 
05:35:45.708 --> 05:35:45.718 align:start position:0%
folks who are receiving insurance
 
05:35:47.990 --> 05:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
through their former employer
 
05:35:50.030 --> 05:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
um and that's funded as a pay you go
 
05:35:52.070 --> 05:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
rate that sure he doesn't calculate a
 
05:35:54.110 --> 05:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
liability for those accounts per se they
 
05:35:56.208 --> 05:35:56.218 align:start position:0%
just estimate how much do we need to
 
05:35:58.368 --> 05:35:58.378 align:start position:0%
bring in to pay the benefit over the
 
05:36:02.690 --> 05:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
biennium and then the middle section of
 
05:36:04.550 --> 05:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
the of slide 17 with all the bullets
 
05:36:07.788 --> 05:36:07.798 align:start position:0%
that is unfunded liability uh this is
 
05:36:10.270 --> 05:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
you know by far the biggest
 
05:36:13.250 --> 05:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
conversation topic uh when it comes to
 
05:36:15.530 --> 05:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
the retirement system this is in a
 
05:36:17.270 --> 05:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
nutshell it's the estimated of accrued
 
05:36:20.750 --> 05:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
nhrs benefits not yet funded so this is
 
05:36:22.970 --> 05:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
benefits promised
 
05:36:25.610 --> 05:36:25.620 align:start position:0%
in the in the future uh that we don't
 
05:36:28.010 --> 05:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
have the assets on hand today to pay
 
05:36:29.510 --> 05:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
today we don't have to pay them today
 
05:36:31.128 --> 05:36:31.138 align:start position:0%
because these are monthly benefits paid
 
05:36:34.250 --> 05:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
over people's lives but you are much
 
05:36:36.170 --> 05:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
happier and better off if you are close
 
05:36:38.750 --> 05:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
to full funding than digging out of a
 
05:36:38.760 --> 05:36:39.708 align:start position:0%
to full funding than digging out of a
hole

05:36:39.708 --> 05:36:39.718 align:start position:0%
hole
 
05:36:39.718 --> 05:36:40.750 align:start position:0%
hole
um

05:36:40.750 --> 05:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:44.270 --> 05:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
5.69 at the close of fiscal 22 5.69
 
05:36:46.670 --> 05:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
billion I'm sorry and that's a funded
 
05:36:49.310 --> 05:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
ratio of 65.6 so we have a little bit
 
05:36:51.650 --> 05:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
less than two-thirds of all the
 
05:36:54.050 --> 05:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
funds we needed if you just you shut the
 
05:36:55.430 --> 05:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
doors on everything today and we were
 
05:36:57.170 --> 05:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
just paying benefits you know for the
 
05:36:59.270 --> 05:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
lifetime of everyone who's earned
 
05:36:59.280 --> 05:37:00.708 align:start position:0%
lifetime of everyone who's earned
benefit

05:37:00.708 --> 05:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
05:37:02.930 --> 05:37:02.940 align:start position:0%
um so how do we have a liability that's
 
05:37:05.030 --> 05:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
a it's a it's an obvious question and
 
05:37:06.708 --> 05:37:06.718 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a good question especially
 
05:37:08.270 --> 05:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
with the Constitutional provision that
 
05:37:09.590 --> 05:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
we have that you know employers need to
 
05:37:11.510 --> 05:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
pay the rates in full
 
05:37:13.368 --> 05:37:13.378 align:start position:0%
um you know there's a
 
05:37:15.170 --> 05:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
I I'm going to give you a long story
 
05:37:16.368 --> 05:37:16.378 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to say is the short
 
05:37:16.378 --> 05:37:17.330 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to say is the short
version

05:37:17.330 --> 05:37:17.340 align:start position:0%
version
 
05:37:20.208 --> 05:37:20.218 align:start position:0%
of that and I I you know I do apologize
 
05:37:20.218 --> 05:37:21.170 align:start position:0%
of that and I I you know I do apologize
but

05:37:21.170 --> 05:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:37:23.390 --> 05:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
um there are several factors and policy
 
05:37:25.850 --> 05:37:25.860 align:start position:0%
decisions made in the 80s and 90s that
 
05:37:27.770 --> 05:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
led to the liability the first was
 
05:37:30.010 --> 05:37:30.020 align:start position:0%
artificially low employer contributions
 
05:37:33.650 --> 05:37:33.660 align:start position:0%
charged from 1991 through
 
05:37:35.390 --> 05:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
um through the and repeat that and
 
05:37:37.910 --> 05:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
repealed until 2007. the backdrop there
 
05:37:40.070 --> 05:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
and I you know I recognized some long
 
05:37:42.288 --> 05:37:42.298 align:start position:0%
time New Hampshire folks I was here at
 
05:37:44.030 --> 05:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
the time as well although I'm not a
 
05:37:45.590 --> 05:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
native uh but there was a there was a
 
05:37:49.070 --> 05:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
recession in the early 90s Savings and
 
05:37:51.230 --> 05:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
Loan crisis let out a lot of people were
 
05:37:53.208 --> 05:37:53.218 align:start position:0%
underwater with the condos many of the
 
05:37:54.948 --> 05:37:54.958 align:start position:0%
state's long-established Banks went
 
05:37:54.958 --> 05:37:56.090 align:start position:0%
state's long-established Banks went
under

05:37:56.090 --> 05:37:56.100 align:start position:0%
under
 
05:37:58.128 --> 05:37:58.138 align:start position:0%
um and and the employer rates were
 
05:38:01.610 --> 05:38:01.620 align:start position:0%
projected to go up in 92-93 based on
 
05:38:03.288 --> 05:38:03.298 align:start position:0%
some benefit improvements to the plan
 
05:38:05.510 --> 05:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
that the legislature had adopted back in
 
05:38:08.868 --> 05:38:08.878 align:start position:0%
89. so you know they with the lag on the
 
05:38:10.368 --> 05:38:10.378 align:start position:0%
way the rates are calculated that was
 
05:38:12.650 --> 05:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
showing up the rates were extremely
 
05:38:14.510 --> 05:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
lower than they are today but as a
 
05:38:16.788 --> 05:38:16.798 align:start position:0%
percentage increase you know you could
 
05:38:17.930 --> 05:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
say oh they're going for from four
 
05:38:19.788 --> 05:38:19.798 align:start position:0%
percent to six percent that's a fifty
 
05:38:21.350 --> 05:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
percent increase I mean it's you know
 
05:38:23.990 --> 05:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
type of thing so so there was a lot of
 
05:38:24.000 --> 05:38:25.310 align:start position:0%
type of thing so so there was a lot of
pressure

05:38:25.310 --> 05:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
pressure
 
05:38:27.350 --> 05:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
to do something about that from local
 
05:38:29.510 --> 05:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
employers you know from the governor's
 
05:38:31.610 --> 05:38:31.620 align:start position:0%
office at the time you know what what
 
05:38:33.530 --> 05:38:33.540 align:start position:0%
can happen you know the legislature you
 
05:38:36.050 --> 05:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
know was strapped as well
 
05:38:38.448 --> 05:38:38.458 align:start position:0%
um and what happened was House Bill 51
 
05:38:42.410 --> 05:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
and that um was a billed initially as a
 
05:38:42.420 --> 05:38:43.850 align:start position:0%
and that um was a billed initially as a
temporary

05:38:43.850 --> 05:38:43.860 align:start position:0%
temporary
 
05:38:47.530 --> 05:38:47.540 align:start position:0%
rate amelioration legislation that
 
05:38:50.990 --> 05:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
changed the Actuarial method that we
 
05:38:53.090 --> 05:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
calculated rates by basically changing
 
05:38:55.368 --> 05:38:55.378 align:start position:0%
the underlying math there were at the
 
05:38:56.990 --> 05:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
time for
 
05:38:59.330 --> 05:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
caught acceptable under gasby and
 
05:39:01.128 --> 05:39:01.138 align:start position:0%
Actuarial standards ways to calculate
 
05:39:04.010 --> 05:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
pension liabilities now there's only one
 
05:39:07.250 --> 05:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
um that meets those standards but um the
 
05:39:09.050 --> 05:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
the sort of the gold standard and I was
 
05:39:11.150 --> 05:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
actually recommended by a consultant for
 
05:39:14.750 --> 05:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
us in 91 was entry age normal
 
05:39:16.788 --> 05:39:16.798 align:start position:0%
um you know but in their report on
 
05:39:18.890 --> 05:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
funding methodologies they had a second
 
05:39:21.350 --> 05:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
page on the executive summary that said
 
05:39:23.330 --> 05:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
uh well there's other four types these
 
05:39:24.770 --> 05:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
other three types are acceptable either
 
05:39:26.390 --> 05:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:39:27.948 --> 05:39:27.958 align:start position:0%
they're a little expensive because of
 
05:39:29.750 --> 05:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
the way they push the liabilities else
 
05:39:32.510 --> 05:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
father and you're in a recession you've
 
05:39:34.970 --> 05:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
got people with pressure and you know
 
05:39:37.670 --> 05:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
you know well-meaning legislators trying
 
05:39:39.890 --> 05:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
to do the best they can and they chose
 
05:39:41.390 --> 05:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
the cheapest way
 
05:39:44.810 --> 05:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
you know so so we we created sort of a
 
05:39:46.788 --> 05:39:46.798 align:start position:0%
systemic underfunding the employers were
 
05:39:49.610 --> 05:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
meeting their constitutional ability to
 
05:39:51.650 --> 05:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
requirement to pay the rates that the
 
05:39:54.350 --> 05:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
board certified but the the math you
 
05:39:55.970 --> 05:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
know I guess the scientific term would
 
05:39:57.288 --> 05:39:57.298 align:start position:0%
be funky
 
05:39:59.750 --> 05:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
um you know and then that was uh kept in
 
05:40:02.570 --> 05:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
stature uh through 07 when it was
 
05:40:03.650 --> 05:40:03.660 align:start position:0%
finally repealed so it didn't really
 
05:40:06.650 --> 05:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
show up until the 10 rates
 
05:40:09.110 --> 05:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
um work their way into the system so
 
05:40:12.350 --> 05:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
that that's I liken it to you know going
 
05:40:13.910 --> 05:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
downstairs in a boat and drilling a
 
05:40:14.930 --> 05:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
couple holes in the bottom and
 
05:40:17.090 --> 05:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
forgetting about it and then you feet
 
05:40:19.250 --> 05:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
get wet 15 years later and you say hey
 
05:40:20.990 --> 05:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
05:40:21.000 --> 05:40:21.850 align:start position:0%
what's going on
um

05:40:21.850 --> 05:40:21.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:25.330 --> 05:40:25.340 align:start position:0%
you know there was some other uh
 
05:40:28.788 --> 05:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
laws where investment gains over a
 
05:40:30.470 --> 05:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
certain amount were segregated to pay
 
05:40:32.150 --> 05:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
for cost of living adjustments and and
 
05:40:34.310 --> 05:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
for the medical subsidies well they were
 
05:40:36.650 --> 05:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
sort of put into what was called a
 
05:40:37.788 --> 05:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
special account
 
05:40:40.490 --> 05:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
so in years where investment returns
 
05:40:42.230 --> 05:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
were really good
 
05:40:43.610 --> 05:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
um you know not all the money stayed in
 
05:40:45.470 --> 05:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
the trust fund to pay pension benefits
 
05:40:47.868 --> 05:40:47.878 align:start position:0%
so when you had a year where it wasn't
 
05:40:49.970 --> 05:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
so good there wasn't any
 
05:40:53.090 --> 05:40:53.100 align:start position:0%
left over to fill the hole so so you
 
05:40:55.430 --> 05:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
know we in the 90s kind of glossed over
 
05:40:57.770 --> 05:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
to a lot of the the structural issues
 
05:40:59.208 --> 05:40:59.218 align:start position:0%
with this I think eight years out of
 
05:41:01.430 --> 05:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
nine we were in double digits you know
 
05:41:04.070 --> 05:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know 15 to 20 percent you
 
05:41:05.990 --> 05:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
know the 90s were very good uh to
 
05:41:06.000 --> 05:41:07.250 align:start position:0%
know the 90s were very good uh to
investors

05:41:07.250 --> 05:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
investors
 
05:41:08.868 --> 05:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
um and then in the early 2000s we had
 
05:41:11.448 --> 05:41:11.458 align:start position:0%
the.com recession and and that that was
 
05:41:13.250 --> 05:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
sort of a wake-up call
 
05:41:15.410 --> 05:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
um you know for policy makers employers
 
05:41:17.330 --> 05:41:17.340 align:start position:0%
and members and there were discussions
 
05:41:20.990 --> 05:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
about you know are we in a good place
 
05:41:21.000 --> 05:41:21.890 align:start position:0%
about you know are we in a good place
um

05:41:21.890 --> 05:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:24.708 --> 05:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
you know so so over a period of years
 
05:41:26.510 --> 05:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
there were like working groups and
 
05:41:28.730 --> 05:41:28.740 align:start position:0%
legislative groups and um beginning in
 
05:41:33.250 --> 05:41:33.260 align:start position:0%
2007 uh with House Bill 653 they re they
 
05:41:36.050 --> 05:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
changed the actual method the two entry
 
05:41:38.448 --> 05:41:38.458 align:start position:0%
age normal they set up a 30-year close
 
05:41:40.010 --> 05:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
the amortization of the unfunded
 
05:41:43.368 --> 05:41:43.378 align:start position:0%
liability uh and uh you know shut off
 
05:41:45.110 --> 05:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
additional funding to the special
 
05:41:47.628 --> 05:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
account under the previous triggers you
 
05:41:50.510 --> 05:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
know really foundational structural
 
05:41:52.670 --> 05:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
stuff that needed to be fixed you know
 
05:41:53.930 --> 05:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
you have an old house and you got to
 
05:41:56.990 --> 05:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
show up the basement walls kind of thing
 
05:42:00.170 --> 05:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
um and then beginning in 08 some benefit
 
05:42:02.868 --> 05:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
uh modifications were put in not not
 
05:42:04.550 --> 05:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
super dramatic but there were some pay
 
05:42:05.930 --> 05:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
types that were taken out of earnable
 
05:42:09.170 --> 05:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
compensation and some laws about
 
05:42:12.410 --> 05:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
um spiking was a big issue back then for
 
05:42:15.410 --> 05:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
people uh building their pension so you
 
05:42:17.390 --> 05:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
know everybody pulled together and got
 
05:42:18.830 --> 05:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
it fixed and then what happened the
 
05:42:20.750 --> 05:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
Great Recession so you know basically
 
05:42:22.730 --> 05:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
you know that that was sort of a tsunami
 
05:42:25.550 --> 05:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
on top of the earthquake so you know if
 
05:42:27.890 --> 05:42:27.900 align:start position:0%
you look at the unfunded liability in 07
 
05:42:30.708 --> 05:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
it was about 2.4 billion and it's over
 
05:42:33.230 --> 05:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
five now how we've got a plan and we're
 
05:42:34.610 --> 05:42:34.620 align:start position:0%
going to tell you it's working how come
 
05:42:37.310 --> 05:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
it's grown so much and and
 
05:42:40.430 --> 05:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin has a question
 
05:42:43.128 --> 05:42:43.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:42:45.770 --> 05:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
um was there ever a time that we didn't
 
05:42:49.090 --> 05:42:49.100 align:start position:0%
have an unfunded liability under the
 
05:42:51.410 --> 05:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
Actuarial methodology in place through
 
05:42:53.330 --> 05:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
the 90s it didn't really calculate a
 
05:42:55.490 --> 05:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
funded ratio as as part of the overall
 
05:42:58.010 --> 05:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
the way they did it but they they the
 
05:42:59.390 --> 05:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
actuary at the time it's a different
 
05:43:01.850 --> 05:43:01.860 align:start position:0%
x-ray now would
 
05:43:04.368 --> 05:43:04.378 align:start position:0%
um calculate a funding funded ratio
 
05:43:06.350 --> 05:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
somehow and we were like oh we're 120
 
05:43:08.208 --> 05:43:08.218 align:start position:0%
funded you know you know so there were
 
05:43:10.550 --> 05:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
numbers and back in the 80s there was
 
05:43:13.190 --> 05:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
some after some some good market run-ups
 
05:43:15.850 --> 05:43:15.860 align:start position:0%
then uh you know we were over 100 funded
 
05:43:18.350 --> 05:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
you know over time but I I don't know
 
05:43:18.360 --> 05:43:19.490 align:start position:0%
you know over time but I I don't know
what

05:43:19.490 --> 05:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:43:22.250 --> 05:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
under the proper actual method if we're
 
05:43:24.288 --> 05:43:24.298 align:start position:0%
ever 100 funded in the 90s but you know
 
05:43:25.910 --> 05:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
we were told we were
 
05:43:28.070 --> 05:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
um you know by the experts thank you
 
05:43:31.070 --> 05:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so so a lot of that liability That
 
05:43:34.010 --> 05:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
Grew um from 07 came out of the Great
 
05:43:37.310 --> 05:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
Recession uh about uh 1.7 billion the
 
05:43:42.050 --> 05:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
decennial retirement Commission in 2017
 
05:43:44.990 --> 05:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
um okay we commissioned an analysis of
 
05:43:46.610 --> 05:43:46.620 align:start position:0%
you know what were the components that
 
05:43:49.128 --> 05:43:49.138 align:start position:0%
grew into the break it was a little bit
 
05:43:51.170 --> 05:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
over five at the time and it was the
 
05:43:54.110 --> 05:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
Great Recession was the biggest driver
 
05:43:55.670 --> 05:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
um as well as something called negative
 
05:43:58.610 --> 05:43:58.620 align:start position:0%
amortization which our our rates weren't
 
05:44:00.230 --> 05:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
paying into the principle of the
 
05:44:02.510 --> 05:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
liability until later on in the 30-year
 
05:44:04.070 --> 05:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
period we did have crossed over since
 
05:44:06.830 --> 05:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
then you know plus uh reductions to our
 
05:44:09.590 --> 05:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
assumed rate of return so um you know it
 
05:44:13.010 --> 05:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
wasn't all policy I mean our board has
 
05:44:15.048 --> 05:44:15.058 align:start position:0%
lowered our assume rate of return in in
 
05:44:17.750 --> 05:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
three different steps since 2011 from
 
05:44:19.730 --> 05:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
eight and a half percent to six point
 
05:44:22.250 --> 05:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
seven five percent and basically when
 
05:44:22.260 --> 05:44:23.330 align:start position:0%
seven five percent and basically when
you

05:44:23.330 --> 05:44:23.340 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:44:25.670 --> 05:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
um assume less money then this the money
 
05:44:26.990 --> 05:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
has to come from somewhere and it comes
 
05:44:29.270 --> 05:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
out of employer contribution so you know
 
05:44:32.750 --> 05:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
we we would we would contend that
 
05:44:34.788 --> 05:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
or in the assumed rate of return is the
 
05:44:37.670 --> 05:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsible thing to do we
 
05:44:39.530 --> 05:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
can't have wishful thinking and just
 
05:44:41.628 --> 05:44:41.638 align:start position:0%
hope we're going to make nine percent
 
05:44:43.910 --> 05:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
um you know uh but you know so so they
 
05:44:45.890 --> 05:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
they need to be realistic the actuary
 
05:44:48.230 --> 05:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't come and say this is what your
 
05:44:49.670 --> 05:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
number should be
 
05:44:51.230 --> 05:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
um but every four years they do what's
 
05:44:53.990 --> 05:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
called an experience study and they they
 
05:44:57.230 --> 05:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
have an aggregate of Capital Market
 
05:44:59.750 --> 05:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
um projections they have from other
 
05:45:01.970 --> 05:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
um you know Financial firms that they
 
05:45:04.430 --> 05:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
Aggregate and leave that with us we have
 
05:45:06.410 --> 05:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
other input from from our investment
 
05:45:08.570 --> 05:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
managers and other other folks and he
 
05:45:10.128 --> 05:45:10.138 align:start position:0%
actually kind of gives us a range of
 
05:45:11.868 --> 05:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
where they're comfortable actually they
 
05:45:14.208 --> 05:45:14.218 align:start position:0%
could sign off and say this is a sound
 
05:45:17.390 --> 05:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
peace you know and you know six and six
 
05:45:19.250 --> 05:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
six and three quarters was was at the
 
05:45:20.750 --> 05:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
high end of what they would have
 
05:45:23.448 --> 05:45:23.458 align:start position:0%
preferred in 2019 but that that's
 
05:45:23.458 --> 05:45:23.990 align:start position:0%
preferred in 2019 but that that's
um

05:45:23.990 --> 05:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:25.730 --> 05:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
you know where the board came down so
 
05:45:27.890 --> 05:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
those are probably the hardest decisions
 
05:45:30.410 --> 05:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
our board has to make is looking at
 
05:45:32.208 --> 05:45:32.218 align:start position:0%
assumptions and in particular the assume
 
05:45:33.708 --> 05:45:33.718 align:start position:0%
rate of return
 
05:45:35.750 --> 05:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
um because there's a lot of
 
05:45:38.448 --> 05:45:38.458 align:start position:0%
um you know political pressures you know
 
05:45:40.730 --> 05:45:40.740 align:start position:0%
make the number work and and we've been
 
05:45:42.770 --> 05:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
blessed to have a number of different
 
05:45:45.048 --> 05:45:45.058 align:start position:0%
trustees over the last decade who really
 
05:45:47.530 --> 05:45:47.540 align:start position:0%
put on their trustee hat and they're not
 
05:45:50.208 --> 05:45:50.218 align:start position:0%
representing you know town of X or
 
05:45:52.910 --> 05:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
County y or you know
 
05:45:55.250 --> 05:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
fire department be you know they they
 
05:45:57.288 --> 05:45:57.298 align:start position:0%
look at it and try to you know make
 
05:45:59.090 --> 05:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
their vote in the best interest of the
 
05:46:01.548 --> 05:46:01.558 align:start position:0%
system overall
 
05:46:04.030 --> 05:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
um so so those those those were
 
05:46:06.230 --> 05:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
self-inflicted additions to the unfunded
 
05:46:08.208 --> 05:46:08.218 align:start position:0%
liability but ones that we argue were
 
05:46:10.190 --> 05:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
more financially
 
05:46:10.200 --> 05:46:11.030 align:start position:0%
more financially
um

05:46:11.030 --> 05:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:13.670 --> 05:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
beneficial in the long run we do have a
 
05:46:16.010 --> 05:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
statutory structure to amortize five
 
05:46:20.390 --> 05:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
billion of the the 5.7 uh by 2039 that's
 
05:46:22.788 --> 05:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
the original 30-year plan uh that was
 
05:46:26.150 --> 05:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
adopted by the legislature back in 07 uh
 
05:46:27.430 --> 05:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
in 2018
 
05:46:29.868 --> 05:46:29.878 align:start position:0%
uh they adopted something called layer
 
05:46:32.270 --> 05:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
demonization and basically what that
 
05:46:35.448 --> 05:46:35.458 align:start position:0%
does is any gains or losses since uh
 
05:46:38.448 --> 05:46:38.458 align:start position:0%
July 1 of 17 are recognized over close
 
05:46:42.170 --> 05:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
20-year periods so basically the idea
 
05:46:43.850 --> 05:46:43.860 align:start position:0%
and this this came out of the decennial
 
05:46:45.650 --> 05:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
commission as well as if
 
05:46:47.628 --> 05:46:47.638 align:start position:0%
everything had to be paid off and we had
 
05:46:52.430 --> 05:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
to be 100 funded by the end of 2039.
 
05:46:52.440 --> 05:46:53.150 align:start position:0%
to be 100 funded by the end of 2039.
um

05:46:53.150 --> 05:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:54.830 --> 05:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
you know what if there was a stock
 
05:46:57.230 --> 05:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
market crash or a recession in 2038 and
 
05:46:59.868 --> 05:46:59.878 align:start position:0%
employee player rates quadrupled you
 
05:47:02.330 --> 05:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
know what good is that for anybody so so
 
05:47:05.270 --> 05:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
they they and layered amortization as a
 
05:47:06.890 --> 05:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
concept that's been gaining traction a
 
05:47:09.048 --> 05:47:09.058 align:start position:0%
lot of uh States
 
05:47:10.610 --> 05:47:10.620 align:start position:0%
um have adopted it so it's like
 
05:47:12.650 --> 05:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
basically for what happens after
 
05:47:16.788 --> 05:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
the big debt gets later put down what do
 
05:47:18.530 --> 05:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
we do going forward and this this will
 
05:47:20.570 --> 05:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
having layers and having the the
 
05:47:22.788 --> 05:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
statutory structure we do now
 
05:47:25.128 --> 05:47:25.138 align:start position:0%
you know our our safeguards on
 
05:47:27.048 --> 05:47:27.058 align:start position:0%
preventing the liability growing to the
 
05:47:29.030 --> 05:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
size it has in the you know in the past
 
05:47:30.530 --> 05:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
you know I mean we're still digging out
 
05:47:32.208 --> 05:47:32.218 align:start position:0%
from that hole but
 
05:47:33.708 --> 05:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
um you know what we've done is you know
 
05:47:36.530 --> 05:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
the regulatory statutory and policy
 
05:47:40.270 --> 05:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
structure that can
 
05:47:43.430 --> 05:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
get us to where we want to go
 
05:47:43.440 --> 05:47:44.570 align:start position:0%
get us to where we want to go
um

05:47:44.570 --> 05:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:47.510 --> 05:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
took it out but there was a reference to
 
05:47:50.270 --> 05:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
um Maine had a similar pension funding
 
05:47:52.430 --> 05:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
problem to New Hampshire
 
05:47:54.170 --> 05:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
um and they began addressing in the mid
 
05:47:56.208 --> 05:47:56.218 align:start position:0%
90s the past Constitutional Amendment
 
05:47:58.910 --> 05:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
they have the same Actuarial method
 
05:47:58.920 --> 05:48:00.590 align:start position:0%
they have the same Actuarial method
similar

05:48:00.590 --> 05:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
similar
 
05:48:02.930 --> 05:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
um size membership
 
05:48:04.070 --> 05:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
um things like that they were actually
 
05:48:05.570 --> 05:48:05.580 align:start position:0%
more poorly funded than New Hampshire
 
05:48:07.970 --> 05:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
ever was uh and they got serious about
 
05:48:10.190 --> 05:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
fixing it about 10-12 years before we
 
05:48:13.430 --> 05:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
did so we look at them as an example
 
05:48:15.048 --> 05:48:15.058 align:start position:0%
um you know and you know there's a lot
 
05:48:18.170 --> 05:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
of sim I'll follow up with a a a paper
 
05:48:20.390 --> 05:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
on that that we did but um you know
 
05:48:23.930 --> 05:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
there in the 86 funded now so it you
 
05:48:25.010 --> 05:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
know the you know and they also
 
05:48:26.750 --> 05:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
benefited out of the shoot from some
 
05:48:28.190 --> 05:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
pretty good Market years and you know
 
05:48:30.890 --> 05:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
the late 90s where we fixed it and then
 
05:48:33.288 --> 05:48:33.298 align:start position:0%
spun into a ditch with a Great Recession
 
05:48:35.570 --> 05:48:35.580 align:start position:0%
so that that added to the degree of
 
05:48:37.250 --> 05:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
difficulty but you know we've shown
 
05:48:39.650 --> 05:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
steady uh even with the reduction as the
 
05:48:41.510 --> 05:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
consumerator return steady progress and
 
05:48:43.190 --> 05:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
the funded ratio
 
05:48:45.610 --> 05:48:45.620 align:start position:0%
I Grew From
 
05:48:50.868 --> 05:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
54.7 percent uh to um the 65.6 over the
 
05:48:53.330 --> 05:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
last 10 years
 
05:48:57.170 --> 05:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
so so um there may or may not be
 
05:48:57.180 --> 05:48:58.128 align:start position:0%
so so um there may or may not be
yeah

05:48:58.128 --> 05:48:58.138 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:48:59.570 --> 05:48:59.580 align:start position:0%
um so you know so so that that's where
 
05:49:01.788 --> 05:49:01.798 align:start position:0%
we're at right now uh you know nobody
 
05:49:03.410 --> 05:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
from nhrs is going to come here and say
 
05:49:06.650 --> 05:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
hey we fixed it done take a bow uh
 
05:49:08.208 --> 05:49:08.218 align:start position:0%
everyone in the room I mean we're we're
 
05:49:10.128 --> 05:49:10.138 align:start position:0%
on our we're on a path we're on it we're
 
05:49:11.810 --> 05:49:11.820 align:start position:0%
on a good path we're showing progress
 
05:49:14.570 --> 05:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
but it's a long journey 2039 is still a
 
05:49:17.150 --> 05:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
long time away and a lot can happen so
 
05:49:18.890 --> 05:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
so you know we need you know we need to
 
05:49:21.470 --> 05:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
meet good stewards and and
 
05:49:23.448 --> 05:49:23.458 align:start position:0%
um you know of watching over that fund
 
05:49:27.350 --> 05:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
and managing it wisely and efficiently
 
05:49:29.990 --> 05:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
um slide 18 shows the uh contribution
 
05:49:32.810 --> 05:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
rates for fiscal 24-25 so those are the
 
05:49:35.930 --> 05:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
ones taking effect this July 1st and it
 
05:49:38.628 --> 05:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
breaks out the normal cost the unfunded
 
05:49:40.368 --> 05:49:40.378 align:start position:0%
liability and the medical subsidy
 
05:49:42.948 --> 05:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
portion of those rates in the columns to
 
05:49:44.570 --> 05:49:44.580 align:start position:0%
the left and then on the far right is
 
05:49:47.390 --> 05:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
the total employer rate by group uh the
 
05:49:49.490 --> 05:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
gray column in the middle is unfunded
 
05:49:51.470 --> 05:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
liability as a percentage of the total
 
05:49:53.570 --> 05:49:53.580 align:start position:0%
pension costs so when you add the ual
 
05:49:55.970 --> 05:49:55.980 align:start position:0%
piece and the normal cost together for
 
05:49:58.610 --> 05:49:58.620 align:start position:0%
the employers how much of that as uaal
 
05:50:02.208 --> 05:50:02.218 align:start position:0%
and it's it's 77 to 85 percent depending
 
05:50:05.030 --> 05:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
on the the member group so you know
 
05:50:08.448 --> 05:50:08.458 align:start position:0%
employee employers and and by extension
 
05:50:10.970 --> 05:50:10.980 align:start position:0%
taxpayers today are
 
05:50:13.548 --> 05:50:13.558 align:start position:0%
paying for the sins of the past
 
05:50:15.708 --> 05:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
um you know and having 20-year layered
 
05:50:18.288 --> 05:50:18.298 align:start position:0%
amortization and getting this big nut uh
 
05:50:19.730 --> 05:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
knocked down will prevent that from
 
05:50:21.048 --> 05:50:21.058 align:start position:0%
happening in the future but be
 
05:50:23.690 --> 05:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
unfortunate you know reality is you know
 
05:50:26.150 --> 05:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
the person who owns your house in 1997
 
05:50:27.530 --> 05:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
really wasn't paying what they should
 
05:50:29.448 --> 05:50:29.458 align:start position:0%
because we weren't charging for these
 
05:50:32.510 --> 05:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
rates and in Europe here now
 
05:50:34.670 --> 05:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
um you know but that that's where we're
 
05:50:36.410 --> 05:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
at at the bottom of the chart it shows
 
05:50:38.208 --> 05:50:38.218 align:start position:0%
the membership of the normal cost what
 
05:50:40.850 --> 05:50:40.860 align:start position:0%
their statutory contribution represents
 
05:50:42.170 --> 05:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
as a percentage of how much they're
 
05:50:47.810 --> 05:50:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:51.288 --> 05:50:51.298 align:start position:0%
Marty do you have a a little history of
 
05:50:54.230 --> 05:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
what the unfunded liability percentage
 
05:50:57.410 --> 05:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
contribution was for the last 10 years
 
05:50:59.628 --> 05:50:59.638 align:start position:0%
so we could see if it's grown has it
 
05:51:02.090 --> 05:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
decreased it's just stayed the same I
 
05:51:04.970 --> 05:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
can I can dig out that and send it over
 
05:51:04.980 --> 05:51:05.810 align:start position:0%
can I can dig out that and send it over
yeah

05:51:05.810 --> 05:51:05.820 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:51:07.548 --> 05:51:07.558 align:start position:0%
um and and you're gonna see that the
 
05:51:09.410 --> 05:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability rate even the rates
 
05:51:12.830 --> 05:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
themselves are going to change you know
 
05:51:14.868 --> 05:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
um every
 
05:51:17.090 --> 05:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
four to five years because of experience
 
05:51:18.470 --> 05:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
studies those are the pieces where we
 
05:51:19.810 --> 05:51:19.820 align:start position:0%
lowered the assumed rate of return
 
05:51:22.190 --> 05:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
therefore the liability on paper became
 
05:51:23.570 --> 05:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
larger so the rates are going to go up
 
05:51:27.048 --> 05:51:27.058 align:start position:0%
it's the the goal of trying to fund
 
05:51:29.090 --> 05:51:29.100 align:start position:0%
um the the liability the way we're doing
 
05:51:31.730 --> 05:51:31.740 align:start position:0%
it now is to have
 
05:51:34.548 --> 05:51:34.558 align:start position:0%
um you know relatively stable rates over
 
05:51:36.170 --> 05:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
the last 30 years it hasn't been the
 
05:51:37.970 --> 05:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
case because you know we kept hitting
 
05:51:40.430 --> 05:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
these waves along the way but if if
 
05:51:42.830 --> 05:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
things smooth out the rates as they are
 
05:51:45.890 --> 05:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
now well what the goal is is those
 
05:51:47.690 --> 05:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
aren't going to vary much you know
 
05:51:49.970 --> 05:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
they'll drop dramatically after 2039 but
 
05:51:51.410 --> 05:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
they're not going to go up a huge amount
 
05:51:54.288 --> 05:51:54.298 align:start position:0%
or down a huge amount until we get
 
05:51:56.090 --> 05:51:56.100 align:start position:0%
through that that five billion piece but
 
05:51:58.730 --> 05:51:58.740 align:start position:0%
I can get you the basically a rate
 
05:52:00.650 --> 05:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
representation you know for the last 10
 
05:52:03.048 --> 05:52:03.058 align:start position:0%
years to show for the committee
 
05:52:05.390 --> 05:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
so I have another question that comes up
 
05:52:07.910 --> 05:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
occasionally especially right now where
 
05:52:09.770 --> 05:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
employees don't have a lot of folks to
 
05:52:11.830 --> 05:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
pick from hiring is becoming a problem
 
05:52:16.128 --> 05:52:16.138 align:start position:0%
so as an example say a police chief
 
05:52:19.730 --> 05:52:19.740 align:start position:0%
retires he's got 25 years in and the
 
05:52:21.650 --> 05:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
town comes back to him and says hey
 
05:52:24.250 --> 05:52:24.260 align:start position:0%
could you be our touted Minister
 
05:52:26.750 --> 05:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
administrator again
 
05:52:30.288 --> 05:52:30.298 align:start position:0%
he's collecting his retirement
 
05:52:34.330 --> 05:52:34.340 align:start position:0%
does he still participate in the system
 
05:52:37.670 --> 05:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
coming forward so he's paying in as say
 
05:52:39.410 --> 05:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
the New Town Administrator for the town
 
05:52:42.170 --> 05:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
and how does that affect his retirement
 
05:52:44.750 --> 05:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
or does once he retires from that
 
05:52:47.868 --> 05:52:47.878 align:start position:0%
position is there like a re-retirement
 
05:52:47.878 --> 05:52:49.310 align:start position:0%
position is there like a re-retirement
or

05:52:49.310 --> 05:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:52:51.530 --> 05:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
it's it's a good example because it
 
05:52:53.628 --> 05:52:53.638 align:start position:0%
shows some of the um the nooks and
 
05:52:56.930 --> 05:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
crannies and the statute overall so
 
05:52:58.970 --> 05:52:58.980 align:start position:0%
um Town administrators or chief
 
05:53:01.670 --> 05:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
administrative officers of a community
 
05:53:03.830 --> 05:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
um have had have a uh the the governing
 
05:53:05.990 --> 05:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
body the you know County Commission or I
 
05:53:07.910 --> 05:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
mean that County this is local you know
 
05:53:10.250 --> 05:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
the Selectmen or the the um
 
05:53:13.128 --> 05:53:13.138 align:start position:0%
uh Town Council have the right if when
 
05:53:15.230 --> 05:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
hiring a chief administrative office
 
05:53:17.628 --> 05:53:17.638 align:start position:0%
officer to exempt them from membership
 
05:53:20.570 --> 05:53:20.580 align:start position:0%
in the retirement system so in that
 
05:53:22.368 --> 05:53:22.378 align:start position:0%
scenario that police chief could say
 
05:53:24.590 --> 05:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
well I want to be a member
 
05:53:26.810 --> 05:53:26.820 align:start position:0%
um which really wouldn't increase their
 
05:53:28.610 --> 05:53:28.620 align:start position:0%
benefit that much and they would lose a
 
05:53:30.350 --> 05:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
couple of automatic benefits from
 
05:53:33.410 --> 05:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
retiring as a group too or they could
 
05:53:35.390 --> 05:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
take their pension that they retired
 
05:53:36.770 --> 05:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
from under group two and still collect
 
05:53:38.330 --> 05:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
whatever salary if the position was
 
05:53:40.610 --> 05:53:40.620 align:start position:0%
properly Exempted under the the
 
05:53:42.830 --> 05:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
statutory exception that that exception
 
05:53:45.350 --> 05:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
has been around since the 70s
 
05:53:47.330 --> 05:53:47.340 align:start position:0%
um you know there's a bill um winning
 
05:53:49.788 --> 05:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
its way over that would extend it to the
 
05:53:51.530 --> 05:53:51.540 align:start position:0%
10 counties
 
05:53:53.570 --> 05:53:53.580 align:start position:0%
um I think that came out of Edna on a
 
05:53:54.830 --> 05:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
pass I don't think it's on the consent
 
05:53:56.990 --> 05:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
for tomorrow so so there are some
 
05:53:59.570 --> 05:53:59.580 align:start position:0%
positions where uh membership is
 
05:54:02.810 --> 05:54:02.820 align:start position:0%
optional or the position can be Exempted
 
05:54:04.730 --> 05:54:04.740 align:start position:0%
um if that police chief wanted to become
 
05:54:07.390 --> 05:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
a commissioner of safety that's another
 
05:54:10.128 --> 05:54:10.138 align:start position:0%
optional membership the person appointed
 
05:54:11.390 --> 05:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
to though because it's a fixed term
 
05:54:13.128 --> 05:54:13.138 align:start position:0%
appointment and folks appointed to fixed
 
05:54:15.530 --> 05:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
terms have the option to participate in
 
05:54:17.570 --> 05:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
the retirement system or not now if you
 
05:54:19.070 --> 05:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
if that
 
05:54:21.410 --> 05:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
police chief for fire chief want you
 
05:54:22.910 --> 05:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
know they asked them to be the finance
 
05:54:25.010 --> 05:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
director that's there's no exemptions
 
05:54:26.868 --> 05:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
for that if it was a full-time job the
 
05:54:29.090 --> 05:54:29.100 align:start position:0%
person would have to you know enroll as
 
05:54:31.070 --> 05:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
a group one not collect any pension from
 
05:54:33.890 --> 05:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
nhrs until they wrap that job up but
 
05:54:35.270 --> 05:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
there are certain positions where
 
05:54:36.830 --> 05:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
they're either membership optional or
 
05:54:40.070 --> 05:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
the the governing body can exempt it
 
05:54:41.628 --> 05:54:41.638 align:start position:0%
um you know and I'm not sure the history
 
05:54:44.030 --> 05:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
of the the hows and whys of of where
 
05:54:46.250 --> 05:54:46.260 align:start position:0%
these what why these positions are all
 
05:54:48.590 --> 05:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
out out of the bounds but there are a
 
05:54:48.600 --> 05:54:49.730 align:start position:0%
out out of the bounds but there are a
few

05:54:49.730 --> 05:54:49.740 align:start position:0%
few
 
05:54:51.530 --> 05:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
could you get us a list of those
 
05:54:53.090 --> 05:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
positions that are exempt from
 
05:54:56.288 --> 05:54:56.298 align:start position:0%
participating in the retirement system
 
05:54:59.690 --> 05:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
yes I mean it'll not
 
05:55:02.090 --> 05:55:02.100 align:start position:0%
you know not in the four page list of
 
05:55:03.890 --> 05:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
titles but you know you know officials
 
05:55:05.868 --> 05:55:05.878 align:start position:0%
appointed for fixed terms uh certain
 
05:55:08.270 --> 05:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
employees of the general court uh you
 
05:55:09.590 --> 05:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
know um things like that that
 
05:55:11.090 --> 05:55:11.100 align:start position:0%
membership's optional for so yeah I can
 
05:55:18.110 --> 05:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:20.390 --> 05:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
05:55:23.990 --> 05:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
Carlin so um I'd like to direct you to
 
05:55:26.990 --> 05:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
um slide number 24 in the appendix which
 
05:55:29.330 --> 05:55:29.340 align:start position:0%
is sort of similar to 18 although one
 
05:55:30.770 --> 05:55:30.780 align:start position:0%
line is a little different so I think
 
05:55:33.110 --> 05:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
there's a typo and one or the other of
 
05:55:34.430 --> 05:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
them but
 
05:55:36.610 --> 05:55:36.620 align:start position:0%
um can you explain
 
05:55:40.128 --> 05:55:40.138 align:start position:0%
why are teachers so different than other
 
05:55:43.368 --> 05:55:43.378 align:start position:0%
group one categories okay yeah this so
 
05:55:46.190 --> 05:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
slide 24 is it it represents the current
 
05:55:50.510 --> 05:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
FY 22 23 rates versus the upcoming uh
 
05:55:52.850 --> 05:55:52.860 align:start position:0%
newly certified FY 24 and the percentage
 
05:55:52.860 --> 05:55:53.868 align:start position:0%
newly certified FY 24 and the percentage
change

05:55:53.868 --> 05:55:53.878 align:start position:0%
change
 
05:55:56.330 --> 05:55:56.340 align:start position:0%
biennium over bienniums you know all the
 
05:55:58.490 --> 05:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
rates did go down a little bit
 
05:56:01.490 --> 05:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
um the the teacher uh percentage in
 
05:56:04.850 --> 05:56:04.860 align:start position:0%
group one is higher than employees for a
 
05:56:07.910 --> 05:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
few factors one is planned demographics
 
05:56:09.830 --> 05:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
that teachers tend to work longer and
 
05:56:11.570 --> 05:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
make more money than employees on
 
05:56:15.170 --> 05:56:15.180 align:start position:0%
average and the teacher plan if this
 
05:56:16.368 --> 05:56:16.378 align:start position:0%
came up yesterday until we're talking
 
05:56:18.350 --> 05:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
about separate
 
05:56:20.208 --> 05:56:20.218 align:start position:0%
um funded ratios for each of the plans
 
05:56:22.368 --> 05:56:22.378 align:start position:0%
but you know we there's an aggregate
 
05:56:24.230 --> 05:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
funded ratio for the overall system and
 
05:56:27.170 --> 05:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
the teacher uh plan probably has the
 
05:56:30.048 --> 05:56:30.058 align:start position:0%
lowest funded ratio of the four part of
 
05:56:32.270 --> 05:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is the decline in
 
05:56:34.010 --> 05:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
the number of active teachers you know
 
05:56:36.708 --> 05:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
we the actuary assumes a flat head count
 
05:56:38.090 --> 05:56:38.100 align:start position:0%
that doesn't it doesn't just project
 
05:56:39.170 --> 05:56:39.180 align:start position:0%
that you know they're going to keep
 
05:56:40.850 --> 05:56:40.860 align:start position:0%
hiring employees and teachers and
 
05:56:42.948 --> 05:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
everyone else across the state but they
 
05:56:46.310 --> 05:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
don't assume it's gonna shrink either
 
05:56:50.390 --> 05:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
um and we saw between 09 and 17 or 18
 
05:56:52.910 --> 05:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
about a thousand fewer active teachers
 
05:56:54.650 --> 05:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
in the you know
 
05:56:56.030 --> 05:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
um in the retirement system those
 
05:56:58.730 --> 05:56:58.740 align:start position:0%
numbers have grown you know I think we
 
05:57:01.788 --> 05:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
added 100 or two years ago and 100 more
 
05:57:03.470 --> 05:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
over the price 200 more over the prior
 
05:57:05.030 --> 05:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
year so we've seen a little bit of a
 
05:57:07.070 --> 05:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
bump in that but you know basically what
 
05:57:09.230 --> 05:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
you're saying is the you'd have a
 
05:57:11.150 --> 05:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
portion of the rate that you're paying
 
05:57:12.708 --> 05:57:12.718 align:start position:0%
the liability on you're assessing that
 
05:57:14.270 --> 05:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
and the employer is on the side the
 
05:57:16.330 --> 05:57:16.340 align:start position:0%
total payroll of the group of teachers
 
05:57:19.190 --> 05:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
and even if teachers got raises there's
 
05:57:21.590 --> 05:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
so fewer of them you know the the
 
05:57:24.948 --> 05:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
unfunded piece per dollar
 
05:57:26.510 --> 05:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
um you know gets higher we still still
 
05:57:27.948 --> 05:57:27.958 align:start position:0%
need to get the money back that way so
 
05:57:30.048 --> 05:57:30.058 align:start position:0%
that that's why the teacher rate is a
 
05:57:31.970 --> 05:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
little more out of whack than uh that
 
05:57:33.530 --> 05:57:33.540 align:start position:0%
and some of some of the difference being
 
05:57:37.070 --> 05:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
the increase the cost above employer
 
05:57:40.070 --> 05:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
over above employees is also the medical
 
05:57:41.690 --> 05:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
subsidy rate is a little bit higher for
 
05:57:41.700 --> 05:57:43.368 align:start position:0%
subsidy rate is a little bit higher for
teachers

05:57:43.368 --> 05:57:43.378 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
05:57:45.590 --> 05:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
um it's one point one three percent of
 
05:57:47.510 --> 05:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
pay uh versus
 
05:57:50.270 --> 05:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
um 0.58 and 0.26 and again the medical
 
05:57:52.310 --> 05:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
subsidy benefit was open to the teacher
 
05:57:53.930 --> 05:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
group roll out longer the legislation
 
05:57:56.810 --> 05:57:56.820 align:start position:0%
repealed it for Employers in the early
 
05:57:59.810 --> 05:57:59.820 align:start position:0%
2000s and they didn't repeal the teacher
 
05:58:02.750 --> 05:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
medical subsidy until 09. so so there's
 
05:58:04.490 --> 05:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
factors that go into that higher rate
 
05:58:06.948 --> 05:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
and you know the head count
 
05:58:09.288 --> 05:58:09.298 align:start position:0%
um and and the subsidy or the two big
 
05:58:12.590 --> 05:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
ones thank you now why did
 
05:58:15.650 --> 05:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
um the current Year's rates go down when
 
05:58:18.890 --> 05:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
you lost money last year shouldn't they
 
05:58:19.850 --> 05:58:19.860 align:start position:0%
go up
 
05:58:22.368 --> 05:58:22.378 align:start position:0%
so so again it all comes down to the
 
05:58:24.650 --> 05:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
timing of the rates so in
 
05:58:28.070 --> 05:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
um odd numbered fiscal year is 19 23 25
 
05:58:30.770 --> 05:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
Etc that the the battery does evaluation
 
05:58:32.330 --> 05:58:32.340 align:start position:0%
and that's the the rate setting
 
05:58:36.048 --> 05:58:36.058 align:start position:0%
valuation so the 24 25 rates were based
 
05:58:37.850 --> 05:58:37.860 align:start position:0%
on the um
 
05:58:40.910 --> 05:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
June 30th of 21 you know which was the
 
05:58:43.850 --> 05:58:43.860 align:start position:0%
29.4 year but that's smooth but even
 
05:58:46.910 --> 05:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
with that the five years were flush
 
05:58:49.010 --> 05:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
enough where the rates were a little bit
 
05:58:51.110 --> 05:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh went down a little bit
 
05:58:52.610 --> 05:58:52.620 align:start position:0%
um you know and we get a question it's
 
05:58:53.868 --> 05:58:53.878 align:start position:0%
like don't you just keep them the same
 
05:58:55.548 --> 05:58:55.558 align:start position:0%
I'd rather just kind of pay ahead a
 
05:58:57.110 --> 05:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
little and it's like
 
05:58:59.628 --> 05:58:59.638 align:start position:0%
you really need to follow the actuary on
 
05:59:01.548 --> 05:59:01.558 align:start position:0%
this one you can
 
05:59:03.350 --> 05:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
put your thumb on the scale one way or
 
05:59:05.750 --> 05:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
the other because it just creates a bad
 
05:59:07.670 --> 05:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
precedent so I mean I we wish they'd
 
05:59:09.410 --> 05:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
stayed the same as well but I mean you
 
05:59:10.850 --> 05:59:10.860 align:start position:0%
know certainly there was a dramatic
 
05:59:10.860 --> 05:59:12.470 align:start position:0%
know certainly there was a dramatic
increase

05:59:12.470 --> 05:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
increase
 
05:59:15.708 --> 05:59:15.718 align:start position:0%
um 2021 to 22 23
 
05:59:17.510 --> 05:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
um because of of assumption changes
 
05:59:19.070 --> 05:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
lowering the assumed rate of return so
 
05:59:20.628 --> 05:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
this does give employers a little bit of
 
05:59:23.150 --> 05:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
a breather but you know we
 
05:59:25.430 --> 05:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
gotta gotta trust the math on that and
 
05:59:27.350 --> 05:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
not play with it so that's why they went
 
05:59:27.360 --> 05:59:28.670 align:start position:0%
not play with it so that's why they went
down

05:59:28.670 --> 05:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
down
 
05:59:31.010 --> 05:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
thank you could I ask some more detailed
 
05:59:32.868 --> 05:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
question so
 
05:59:35.030 --> 05:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
um our employees on the benefit side our
 
05:59:37.970 --> 05:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
employees allowed when they retire to
 
05:59:40.730 --> 05:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
take a two life benefit versus a one
 
05:59:42.708 --> 05:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
life benefit if they're married can they
 
05:59:45.830 --> 05:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
yes fixed and yeah we have in the
 
05:59:47.030 --> 05:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
stasher they're referred to as
 
05:59:49.910 --> 05:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
survivorship options so you can leave
 
05:59:52.250 --> 05:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
um if you take the maximum benefit it's
 
05:59:54.410 --> 05:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
calculated a certain way and it goes to
 
05:59:56.270 --> 05:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
you for life and then you know if
 
05:59:57.770 --> 05:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
there's any money left of your
 
05:59:59.570 --> 05:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
contributions that weren't yet paid out
 
06:00:01.670 --> 06:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
to you that would go to your beneficiary
 
06:00:04.010 --> 06:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
the lump sum payment or you can choose a
 
06:00:06.048 --> 06:00:06.058 align:start position:0%
survivorship option
 
06:00:08.150 --> 06:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
um typically either 50 or 100 percent of
 
06:00:09.590 --> 06:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
the benefit
 
06:00:11.270 --> 06:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
um and and there's a reduction to the
 
06:00:12.890 --> 06:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
benefit from the get-go when somebody
 
06:00:14.990 --> 06:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
chooses a survivorship option it's it's
 
06:00:17.270 --> 06:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
all predicated on a life expectancy of
 
06:00:19.368 --> 06:00:19.378 align:start position:0%
the member and the beneficiary
 
06:00:21.230 --> 06:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
um you know for the multiple lives so if
 
06:00:23.810 --> 06:00:23.820 align:start position:0%
you chose a survivorship option and you
 
06:00:26.750 --> 06:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to do 50 of your benefit for a
 
06:00:29.090 --> 06:00:29.100 align:start position:0%
spouse who's similar in age to you the
 
06:00:30.470 --> 06:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
reduction is going to be less than if
 
06:00:33.470 --> 06:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
you want to leave 100 to your child you
 
06:00:34.670 --> 06:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
know because that person is going to
 
06:00:36.770 --> 06:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
live a lot longer you know when it's a
 
06:00:39.288 --> 06:00:39.298 align:start position:0%
larger benefit so so those
 
06:00:41.330 --> 06:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
um life expectancy natural tables are
 
06:00:42.948 --> 06:00:42.958 align:start position:0%
updated every four years as part of the
 
06:00:45.830 --> 06:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
experience study so so that that's the
 
06:00:48.170 --> 06:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
design to account for the two lives
 
06:00:52.010 --> 06:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
I see thank you and last question is how
 
06:00:55.190 --> 06:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
much gain does the does the system get
 
06:00:58.128 --> 06:00:58.138 align:start position:0%
from employees who leave before they're
 
06:00:58.138 --> 06:00:59.208 align:start position:0%
from employees who leave before they're
vested

06:00:59.208 --> 06:00:59.218 align:start position:0%
vested
 
06:01:01.910 --> 06:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of I don't know dollar
 
06:01:05.150 --> 06:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
amount or percentage
 
06:01:08.150 --> 06:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
um if if a return if someone Works more
 
06:01:10.850 --> 06:01:10.860 align:start position:0%
than six months and then would terminate
 
06:01:12.410 --> 06:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
service you know whether by choice or
 
06:01:12.420 --> 06:01:13.548 align:start position:0%
service you know whether by choice or
otherwise

06:01:13.548 --> 06:01:13.558 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
06:01:14.628 --> 06:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
um you know so they're no longer
 
06:01:16.128 --> 06:01:16.138 align:start position:0%
contributing they have invested yet
 
06:01:18.410 --> 06:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
because they haven't put in 10 years
 
06:01:20.230 --> 06:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
um they're entitled to their their
 
06:01:22.250 --> 06:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
contributions that they put in plus
 
06:01:24.770 --> 06:01:24.780 align:start position:0%
credited interest but the trust fund
 
06:01:26.750 --> 06:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
keeps the employer contributions put in
 
06:01:28.730 --> 06:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
on behalf if it's less than six months
 
06:01:31.730 --> 06:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
we re we do reimburse the employer
 
06:01:32.628 --> 06:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
um for that
 
06:01:35.390 --> 06:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
um but um so so anybody who doesn't make
 
06:01:37.970 --> 06:01:37.980 align:start position:0%
it to vesting and doesn't come back in
 
06:01:39.948 --> 06:01:39.958 align:start position:0%
later invest all that that money pays
 
06:01:41.690 --> 06:01:41.700 align:start position:0%
other people's benefits you know and
 
06:01:42.948 --> 06:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
that that that's that's sort of the
 
06:01:44.510 --> 06:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
magic of the of the defined benefit
 
06:01:46.910 --> 06:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
there's you know somebody's going to
 
06:01:49.548 --> 06:01:49.558 align:start position:0%
live to 110 and unfortunately you know
 
06:01:51.470 --> 06:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
somebody's gonna die six months after
 
06:01:53.690 --> 06:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
they retire but when you have a large
 
06:01:55.368 --> 06:01:55.378 align:start position:0%
pool of people you know that's gonna
 
06:01:57.948 --> 06:01:57.958 align:start position:0%
even out you know you know you know in
 
06:01:59.270 --> 06:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
the big picture
 
06:02:01.548 --> 06:02:01.558 align:start position:0%
right but my question is can you give me
 
06:02:04.610 --> 06:02:04.620 align:start position:0%
a number in terms of
 
06:02:08.570 --> 06:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
um how much that did the did the system
 
06:02:12.530 --> 06:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
grab from that person compared to their
 
06:02:14.990 --> 06:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
own what they what their own
 
06:02:17.150 --> 06:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
um contribution to the plan was at that
 
06:02:19.128 --> 06:02:19.138 align:start position:0%
when they left say somebody leaves after
 
06:02:22.010 --> 06:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
eight years okay so there's a certain
 
06:02:24.650 --> 06:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
amount in the system that's if came from
 
06:02:26.830 --> 06:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
the employer the system's going to keep
 
06:02:29.330 --> 06:02:29.340 align:start position:0%
versus what they're going to return to
 
06:02:32.090 --> 06:02:32.100 align:start position:0%
the guy from their seven percent or
 
06:02:34.730 --> 06:02:34.740 align:start position:0%
whatever they put in over time you see
 
06:02:36.350 --> 06:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
what I mean yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna
 
06:02:38.930 --> 06:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
start and ask for me to jump in if if
 
06:02:40.730 --> 06:02:40.740 align:start position:0%
you know otherwise from the finance side
 
06:02:43.430 --> 06:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
but I mean it to my knowledge all of the
 
06:02:45.830 --> 06:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
employer contributions come in and
 
06:02:47.810 --> 06:02:47.820 align:start position:0%
they're all credited to the Chicago
 
06:02:50.390 --> 06:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
State accumulated annuity trust fund is
 
06:02:51.470 --> 06:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
a lump
 
06:02:52.910 --> 06:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
um you know the member contribution they
 
06:02:54.350 --> 06:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
were accounted for separately you know
 
06:02:56.510 --> 06:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
for cases in which somebody withdraws or
 
06:02:58.128 --> 06:02:58.138 align:start position:0%
you know there's a benefit to be paid
 
06:03:00.830 --> 06:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
but you know like you know pan over or
 
06:03:03.230 --> 06:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
you know Lebanon isn't paying in
 
06:03:05.270 --> 06:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
for representative McGuire the opinion
 
06:03:06.948 --> 06:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
for everybody works for Lebanon and all
 
06:03:08.510 --> 06:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
that money just goes into the to a big
 
06:03:11.150 --> 06:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
sack so um you know we could if we had
 
06:03:12.350 --> 06:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
to you know
 
06:03:14.030 --> 06:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
for a legal reason or something try to
 
06:03:15.650 --> 06:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
tease it out like okay what was the
 
06:03:18.170 --> 06:03:18.180 align:start position:0%
employer contribution rate in in effect
 
06:03:19.910 --> 06:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
for the years that this person worked
 
06:03:21.470 --> 06:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
but there's no easy we don't account for
 
06:03:21.480 --> 06:03:23.150 align:start position:0%
but there's no easy we don't account for
that

06:03:23.150 --> 06:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:03:26.208 --> 06:03:26.218 align:start position:0%
um in any of our normal reporting
 
06:03:28.610 --> 06:03:28.620 align:start position:0%
um because it's just considered you know
 
06:03:30.948 --> 06:03:30.958 align:start position:0%
part of the you know I guess maybe
 
06:03:32.510 --> 06:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
another question another way to ask the
 
06:03:33.890 --> 06:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
same thing is
 
06:03:37.610 --> 06:03:37.620 align:start position:0%
how many do 50 of the people who start
 
06:03:42.110 --> 06:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
on day one end up vesting 10 years later
 
06:03:46.610 --> 06:03:46.620 align:start position:0%
or is it 85 percent or is it 35 you know
 
06:03:49.448 --> 06:03:49.458 align:start position:0%
what what fraction of people who start
 
06:03:53.030 --> 06:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
employment in in the system end up
 
06:03:54.890 --> 06:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
becoming vested
 
06:03:59.570 --> 06:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:59.580 --> 06:04:00.850 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

06:04:00.850 --> 06:04:00.860 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:04:03.770 --> 06:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
when the actor doesn't experience study
 
06:04:06.350 --> 06:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
every four four to five years it's it's
 
06:04:08.090 --> 06:04:08.100 align:start position:0%
on a four-year schedule now they look at
 
06:04:10.490 --> 06:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
you know withdrawals over you know
 
06:04:13.850 --> 06:04:13.860 align:start position:0%
periods of time so we may have you've
 
06:04:14.990 --> 06:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
got a
 
06:04:17.090 --> 06:04:17.100 align:start position:0%
super duper Deluxe
 
06:04:18.530 --> 06:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
you know spreadsheet that covers
 
06:04:20.390 --> 06:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
everything but it can show patterns and
 
06:04:22.490 --> 06:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
then maybe we can if maybe they're in
 
06:04:25.310 --> 06:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
their analysis there's some percentage I
 
06:04:26.930 --> 06:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's you know I mean even if
 
06:04:29.030 --> 06:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
you wanted to pick a specific year right
 
06:04:31.070 --> 06:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
yeah all the people that got hired in
 
06:04:31.080 --> 06:04:32.390 align:start position:0%
yeah all the people that got hired in
2000

06:04:32.390 --> 06:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
2000
 
06:04:34.970 --> 06:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
look at 2010 how many are still left
 
06:04:37.070 --> 06:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
right you know something like that that
 
06:04:39.230 --> 06:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
might not be too hard to do anyways I'd
 
06:04:40.788 --> 06:04:40.798 align:start position:0%
like I'd like to get that day yeah we'll
 
06:04:42.350 --> 06:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
we'll check into that yeah thank you
 
06:04:43.970 --> 06:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
definitely and get you an answer either
 
06:04:45.470 --> 06:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
way you know whether it's what we have
 
06:04:45.480 --> 06:04:46.310 align:start position:0%
way you know whether it's what we have
and

06:04:46.310 --> 06:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:04:48.770 --> 06:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
and we can pull it together
 
06:04:51.110 --> 06:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
maybe it's just a quick follow-up to
 
06:04:53.510 --> 06:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire's question just
 
06:04:55.990 --> 06:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps this last year how many people
 
06:04:59.270 --> 06:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
exited uh that will obviously not
 
06:05:01.910 --> 06:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
receive the 10-year vesting just even a
 
06:05:04.670 --> 06:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
yearly how many people average during
 
06:05:06.530 --> 06:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
the course of a year may exit the system
 
06:05:06.540 --> 06:05:08.448 align:start position:0%
the course of a year may exit the system
okay

06:05:08.448 --> 06:05:08.458 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:05:10.670 --> 06:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
try try to get
 
06:05:12.890 --> 06:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
triangulate something that is responsive
 
06:05:16.128 --> 06:05:16.138 align:start position:0%
as as we can for for the question uh
 
06:05:16.138 --> 06:05:17.390 align:start position:0%
as as we can for for the question uh
definitely

06:05:17.390 --> 06:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
06:05:17.400 --> 06:05:18.230 align:start position:0%
definitely
um

06:05:18.230 --> 06:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:20.448 --> 06:05:20.458 align:start position:0%
didn't want to add one thing about the
 
06:05:22.970 --> 06:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
the the the withdrawal you know folks
 
06:05:25.310 --> 06:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
who don't who work and don't invest that
 
06:05:27.830 --> 06:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's also an Actuarial assumption you
 
06:05:29.208 --> 06:05:29.218 align:start position:0%
know a percentage of that and that that
 
06:05:30.830 --> 06:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
goes into the rates there is an
 
06:05:33.230 --> 06:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
expectation that some people for for
 
06:05:35.390 --> 06:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
whatever reason aren't gonna make it all
 
06:05:36.830 --> 06:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
the way to go you know they're gonna
 
06:05:38.628 --> 06:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
stop playing the game at some point so
 
06:05:40.610 --> 06:05:40.620 align:start position:0%
so that that is built into the
 
06:05:43.128 --> 06:05:43.138 align:start position:0%
assumptions as well already
 
06:05:45.770 --> 06:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
a representative from Windham that's not
 
06:05:47.330 --> 06:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
on the division but he's been trying to
 
06:05:49.128 --> 06:05:49.138 align:start position:0%
get my attention but you're welcome to
 
06:05:51.770 --> 06:05:51.780 align:start position:0%
sit right up in that vacant seat and use
 
06:05:57.350 --> 06:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:59.750 --> 06:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and it's not really a
 
06:06:01.730 --> 06:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
question and I promise not to interrupt
 
06:06:04.010 --> 06:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
often but since you are asking that
 
06:06:07.070 --> 06:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
question I am one of the employees who
 
06:06:08.868 --> 06:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
is technically right now not vested
 
06:06:10.670 --> 06:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
because I served to the town for six and
 
06:06:12.948 --> 06:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
a half if you ask those questions I
 
06:06:14.750 --> 06:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
would be one of the people who doesn't
 
06:06:17.150 --> 06:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
qualify for retirement but there is
 
06:06:19.010 --> 06:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
always the possibility that at some
 
06:06:20.570 --> 06:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
point later I will complete my other
 
06:06:22.128 --> 06:06:22.138 align:start position:0%
three years and a half so you gotta be
 
06:06:24.470 --> 06:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
just careful about how you ask those
 
06:06:26.208 --> 06:06:26.218 align:start position:0%
questions because I think I know what
 
06:06:28.310 --> 06:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
you're getting to but this may not be
 
06:06:31.250 --> 06:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
the data set that will answer you know
 
06:06:33.650 --> 06:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
the question of how much money at some
 
06:06:37.490 --> 06:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
point is vested but never you know is
 
06:06:39.948 --> 06:06:39.958 align:start position:0%
paid but never invested into so I don't
 
06:06:41.330 --> 06:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
want to get too geeky I don't want to
 
06:06:43.310 --> 06:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
hijack the conference but I just wanted
 
06:06:45.048 --> 06:06:45.058 align:start position:0%
to quickly make that point and I'll go
 
06:06:47.570 --> 06:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
back to my seat as soon as you are done
 
06:06:50.330 --> 06:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
sure and you might have it when you get
 
06:06:53.270 --> 06:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
close to 65 you might have a big a good
 
06:06:55.448 --> 06:06:55.458 align:start position:0%
incentive to work another five years
 
06:07:00.230 --> 06:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
just to get that thing right so yeah I
 
06:07:00.240 --> 06:07:01.070 align:start position:0%
just to get that thing right so yeah I
agree

06:07:01.070 --> 06:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
agree
 
06:07:05.208 --> 06:07:05.218 align:start position:0%
um yeah I was speaking to a member of
 
06:07:08.628 --> 06:07:08.638 align:start position:0%
the AG's office recently a guy who's in
 
06:07:11.330 --> 06:07:11.340 align:start position:0%
his early 40s and he's leaving after
 
06:07:13.368 --> 06:07:13.378 align:start position:0%
eight and a half years believe it or not
 
06:07:16.010 --> 06:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
because he just can't he's got four kids
 
06:07:17.810 --> 06:07:17.820 align:start position:0%
and a stay-at-home wife and he can't
 
06:07:20.570 --> 06:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
afford to keep doing it and so he's
 
06:07:22.610 --> 06:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
leaving a lot of money on the table so
 
06:07:24.708 --> 06:07:24.718 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering is that a big effect
 
06:07:27.048 --> 06:07:27.058 align:start position:0%
is it a one in a hundred effect who
 
06:07:28.970 --> 06:07:28.980 align:start position:0%
knows right
 
06:07:31.670 --> 06:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
into the representatives point I know I
 
06:07:33.170 --> 06:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
know we wouldn't have any data on this
 
06:07:35.150 --> 06:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
but there you know it was always people
 
06:07:37.910 --> 06:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
who leave before vesting can come back
 
06:07:39.288 --> 06:07:39.298 align:start position:0%
um because sometimes you know when when
 
06:07:41.570 --> 06:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
there's layoffs it is an involuntary
 
06:07:42.890 --> 06:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
separation and they're hoping to get
 
06:07:44.230 --> 06:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
back they're on a riff list or something
 
06:07:46.850 --> 06:07:46.860 align:start position:0%
uh we see you know people taking breaks
 
06:07:48.708 --> 06:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
in service you know to raise small
 
06:07:50.750 --> 06:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
children things like that but they're
 
06:07:52.548 --> 06:07:52.558 align:start position:0%
expect planning to go back you know to
 
06:07:53.930 --> 06:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
the classroom or whatever you know they
 
06:07:56.390 --> 06:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
do things like that so so you know it
 
06:07:59.448 --> 06:07:59.458 align:start position:0%
you know members do have after you know
 
06:08:01.490 --> 06:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
a short period have they can withdraw
 
06:08:03.170 --> 06:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
their contribution to their money I mean
 
06:08:05.030 --> 06:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
your question is about the employer's
 
06:08:05.040 --> 06:08:06.230 align:start position:0%
your question is about the employer's
money

06:08:06.230 --> 06:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
money
 
06:08:07.610 --> 06:08:07.620 align:start position:0%
um you know but you know they can keep
 
06:08:09.170 --> 06:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
it with us and let it ride or they can
 
06:08:10.970 --> 06:08:10.980 align:start position:0%
take it out or roll it over into
 
06:08:13.910 --> 06:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
something else at any point as well
 
06:08:16.150 --> 06:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
um to just
 
06:08:18.230 --> 06:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
I'll go right ahead I'm just gonna say
 
06:08:20.270 --> 06:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
just to wrap it up I I probably went way
 
06:08:22.190 --> 06:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
over and I apologize
 
06:08:23.390 --> 06:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
um you know we you know just some
 
06:08:25.310 --> 06:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
summary slides here you know we provide
 
06:08:27.350 --> 06:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
a modest pension benefit
 
06:08:29.628 --> 06:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
um you know a little bit over 20 under
 
06:08:31.548 --> 06:08:31.558 align:start position:0%
22 000 I guess is the best way to put it
 
06:08:33.170 --> 06:08:33.180 align:start position:0%
the majority of those folks who are
 
06:08:34.850 --> 06:08:34.860 align:start position:0%
collecting those benefits remain in
 
06:08:37.430 --> 06:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
state pay their property tax bills go
 
06:08:39.350 --> 06:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
out to eat with that money pay the rooms
 
06:08:41.750 --> 06:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
and meals tax uh we have a plan in place
 
06:08:43.850 --> 06:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
to pay down our unfunded liability and
 
06:08:47.208 --> 06:08:47.218 align:start position:0%
manage volatility going forward and you
 
06:08:49.190 --> 06:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
know the board has besides the steps the
 
06:08:50.868 --> 06:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
legislature has taken over the last 15
 
06:08:53.628 --> 06:08:53.638 align:start position:0%
or so years the board has been trying to
 
06:08:55.610 --> 06:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
take responsible steps to ensure proper
 
06:08:57.890 --> 06:08:57.900 align:start position:0%
funding uh regarding the assumed rate of
 
06:09:00.350 --> 06:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
return and things like that
 
06:09:01.548 --> 06:09:01.558 align:start position:0%
um you know we do have this the
 
06:09:04.250 --> 06:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
Constitutional and statutory foundation
 
06:09:07.490 --> 06:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
in place to get the job done it's it's
 
06:09:10.490 --> 06:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
it would be very difficult for our
 
06:09:12.530 --> 06:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
future policy makers to walk away from
 
06:09:15.288 --> 06:09:15.298 align:start position:0%
these obligations with the structure we
 
06:09:17.390 --> 06:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
have in place now and it is a marathon
 
06:09:20.270 --> 06:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
not a Sprint uh it took years to dig the
 
06:09:22.310 --> 06:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
hole that we're coming out of now and
 
06:09:24.890 --> 06:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
it's going to take twice as long to get
 
06:09:26.448 --> 06:09:26.458 align:start position:0%
back out of there but you know the you
 
06:09:28.548 --> 06:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
know the the progress is being made as
 
06:09:31.310 --> 06:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
seen in the funding ratio so
 
06:09:33.230 --> 06:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
um like I said again not not a time to
 
06:09:35.090 --> 06:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
declare Victory but a time to declare
 
06:09:38.150 --> 06:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
progress uh you know um going ahead try
 
06:09:40.788 --> 06:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
to try not to oversell uh so that that's
 
06:09:43.070 --> 06:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
the end of the slide portion
 
06:09:44.868 --> 06:09:44.878 align:start position:0%
um so I'll be glad to try to answer more
 
06:09:46.250 --> 06:09:46.260 align:start position:0%
questions or if you want to talk to Mr
 
06:09:48.770 --> 06:09:48.780 align:start position:0%
Downing now
 
06:09:52.310 --> 06:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
are there any uh additional questions
 
06:09:55.310 --> 06:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much excellent
 
06:09:57.350 --> 06:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
um again I know the dot misses you have
 
06:10:04.010 --> 06:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:04.020 --> 06:10:06.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:10:06.650 --> 06:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:06.660 --> 06:10:12.730 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

06:10:12.730 --> 06:10:12.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:16.970 --> 06:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
well I'm glad you used the short long
 
06:10:19.010 --> 06:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
version because usually Marty just
 
06:10:20.390 --> 06:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
points to me when he talks about the
 
06:10:23.448 --> 06:10:23.458 align:start position:0%
unconscious liability it's a try to
 
06:10:25.490 --> 06:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
explain why we're in a hole because he
 
06:10:29.048 --> 06:10:29.058 align:start position:0%
was molecular in 88 89.
 
06:10:31.880 --> 06:10:31.890 align:start position:0%
he knows he was part of that
 
06:10:31.890 --> 06:10:33.230 align:start position:0%
he knows he was part of that
[Music]

06:10:33.230 --> 06:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:10:36.010 --> 06:10:36.020 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
06:13:13.030 --> 06:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:16.070 --> 06:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
oops again my name is Craig Downing
 
06:13:17.390 --> 06:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
executive director of the Deferred
 
06:13:19.070 --> 06:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
Compensation Plan
 
06:13:21.288 --> 06:13:21.298 align:start position:0%
um it is a voluntary plan we have
 
06:13:24.048 --> 06:13:24.058 align:start position:0%
approximately 40 percent of current
 
06:13:26.750 --> 06:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
state employees that are contributing
 
06:13:28.670 --> 06:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
um there is no State money involved in
 
06:13:31.250 --> 06:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
the operation of the plan or in the plan
 
06:13:33.910 --> 06:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
itself there's no employer contribution
 
06:13:38.150 --> 06:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh to the participants retirement this
 
06:13:40.310 --> 06:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
is in addition to Social Security and
 
06:13:44.208 --> 06:13:44.218 align:start position:0%
the nhrs pension uh it has its own
 
06:13:47.930 --> 06:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
special it's called a 457 plan it it
 
06:13:51.530 --> 06:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
operates like a 401k plan for public
 
06:13:55.010 --> 06:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
employees whatever the contribution is
 
06:13:58.128 --> 06:13:58.138 align:start position:0%
that that the participant voluntarily
 
06:14:00.770 --> 06:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
gives does not count against has no
 
06:14:02.868 --> 06:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
effect on the pension benefit or their
 
06:14:04.330 --> 06:14:04.340 align:start position:0%
social security
 
06:14:07.788 --> 06:14:07.798 align:start position:0%
everything their contributions are net
 
06:14:10.788 --> 06:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
of Social Security
 
06:14:13.910 --> 06:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
um as you can see the uh you know some
 
06:14:16.548 --> 06:14:16.558 align:start position:0%
agencies are better than others this
 
06:14:19.310 --> 06:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
plan was established in 1977 when they
 
06:14:22.368 --> 06:14:22.378 align:start position:0%
passed the 457 Act took a couple of
 
06:14:24.590 --> 06:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
sessions to get it up and running a lot
 
06:14:27.288 --> 06:14:27.298 align:start position:0%
of changes in the law or additions in
 
06:14:27.298 --> 06:14:29.750 align:start position:0%
of changes in the law or additions in
1979

06:14:29.750 --> 06:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
1979
 
06:14:32.750 --> 06:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
um I began in 89 after I
 
06:14:34.570 --> 06:14:34.580 align:start position:0%
finished my session
 
06:14:38.330 --> 06:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
in the legislature setting uh
 
06:14:41.090 --> 06:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
studying the pension system up
 
06:14:43.970 --> 06:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
for their unfunded liability Marty
 
06:14:46.548 --> 06:14:46.558 align:start position:0%
claims that he's got a voting record but
 
06:14:46.558 --> 06:14:47.390 align:start position:0%
claims that he's got a voting record but
I

06:14:47.390 --> 06:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:14:49.788 --> 06:14:49.798 align:start position:0%
he's not produced it
 
06:14:53.030 --> 06:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
um so I began the state 89 with not a
 
06:14:55.490 --> 06:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
thought that I was going to continue to
 
06:14:58.490 --> 06:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
be a state employee and I remember at
 
06:15:01.070 --> 06:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
orientation I got a similar piece of
 
06:15:02.448 --> 06:15:02.458 align:start position:0%
information I threw it in the trash
 
06:15:03.708 --> 06:15:03.718 align:start position:0%
because I wasn't going to retire from
 
06:15:06.948 --> 06:15:06.958 align:start position:0%
the state I was in my late 20s well 32
 
06:15:10.030 --> 06:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
years later and 24 of those at Labor
 
06:15:13.310 --> 06:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
here I am so I I joined on my fifth year
 
06:15:15.350 --> 06:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
anniversary when a co-worker advised me
 
06:15:16.610 --> 06:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
06:15:19.010 --> 06:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
I was closer to the pension than I was
 
06:15:20.390 --> 06:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
to the front door
 
06:15:23.750 --> 06:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
and I think I started that paycheck in
 
06:15:27.110 --> 06:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
the middle of July like 10 or 15 dollars
 
06:15:29.930 --> 06:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
and the if you all as you all know the
 
06:15:31.670 --> 06:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
time value of money if I'd started with
 
06:15:34.670 --> 06:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
that 10 or 15 the day I'd started work
 
06:15:36.470 --> 06:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
um you'd be talking to my successor
 
06:15:38.930 --> 06:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
today because the Deferred Compensation
 
06:15:41.030 --> 06:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
account is probably the best regulator
 
06:15:45.170 --> 06:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
of when I can afford to retire
 
06:15:45.180 --> 06:15:45.948 align:start position:0%
of when I can afford to retire
um

06:15:45.948 --> 06:15:45.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:48.410 --> 06:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
that the state didn't do a very good job
 
06:15:50.690 --> 06:15:50.700 align:start position:0%
on this and I think probably if we think
 
06:15:53.390 --> 06:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
about the exempt employees the
 
06:15:56.270 --> 06:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
commission level that can choose the
 
06:15:58.930 --> 06:15:58.940 align:start position:0%
lawyers at doj which can choose if they
 
06:16:01.910 --> 06:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
want to be in the plan or not if they
 
06:16:03.350 --> 06:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
want to be in the retirement plan or not
 
06:16:06.590 --> 06:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me this was seen I think probably
 
06:16:09.110 --> 06:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature at the time is this
 
06:16:11.750 --> 06:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
plane is a little as a little bonus that
 
06:16:15.948 --> 06:16:15.958 align:start position:0%
we can provide for those workers so it
 
06:16:20.208 --> 06:16:20.218 align:start position:0%
was never promoted uh to any extent I
 
06:16:21.590 --> 06:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
got on the commission we have an
 
06:16:23.628 --> 06:16:23.638 align:start position:0%
eight-member commission I got on the
 
06:16:25.850 --> 06:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
Commission in 2007 when I was still at
 
06:16:28.128 --> 06:16:28.138 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor because I was
 
06:16:30.410 --> 06:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
investing I was getting better returns
 
06:16:34.970 --> 06:16:34.980 align:start position:0%
at a lower cost outside the plan
 
06:16:38.030 --> 06:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
um we've really done a generational
 
06:16:42.110 --> 06:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
change since then we talk about the
 
06:16:42.120 --> 06:16:42.948 align:start position:0%
change since then we talk about the
um

06:16:42.948 --> 06:16:42.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:46.910 --> 06:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
the first market crash that caused the
 
06:16:49.788 --> 06:16:49.798 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability I joined the
 
06:16:52.548 --> 06:16:52.558 align:start position:0%
organization I had to fight to join the
 
06:16:54.230 --> 06:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
organization go to Baltimore for a
 
06:16:55.670 --> 06:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
National Conference
 
06:16:58.610 --> 06:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:17:01.128 --> 06:17:01.138 align:start position:0%
it happened when at the conference and
 
06:17:02.868 --> 06:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
we watched we stood in the hotel lobby
 
06:17:04.610 --> 06:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
and watched the stock market go off the
 
06:17:06.048 --> 06:17:06.058 align:start position:0%
cliff and I thought what have I gotten
 
06:17:10.128 --> 06:17:10.138 align:start position:0%
myself into but time has cured that and
 
06:17:13.128 --> 06:17:13.138 align:start position:0%
uh just like it's it's uh is curing it
 
06:17:14.690 --> 06:17:14.700 align:start position:0%
for the pension
 
06:17:14.700 --> 06:17:15.470 align:start position:0%
for the pension
um

06:17:15.470 --> 06:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:18.590 --> 06:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's I think this is the The
 
06:17:20.510 --> 06:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
Greatest Secret still in state
 
06:17:20.520 --> 06:17:21.708 align:start position:0%
Greatest Secret still in state
government

06:17:21.708 --> 06:17:21.718 align:start position:0%
government
 
06:17:23.750 --> 06:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
um that the state has gotten much better
 
06:17:26.150 --> 06:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
in promoting it
 
06:17:28.490 --> 06:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
um and we're it's now part of the
 
06:17:30.830 --> 06:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
onboarding process I believe at every
 
06:17:32.390 --> 06:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
single agency
 
06:17:34.970 --> 06:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
uh and the division of personnel has
 
06:17:37.490 --> 06:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
done an excellent job in creating an
 
06:17:38.868 --> 06:17:38.878 align:start position:0%
onboarding system
 
06:17:41.650 --> 06:17:41.660 align:start position:0%
we still don't have a very standard
 
06:17:45.288 --> 06:17:45.298 align:start position:0%
off-boarding system there is a limited
 
06:17:47.448 --> 06:17:47.458 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
06:17:47.458 --> 06:17:48.890 align:start position:0%
amount of
of

06:17:48.890 --> 06:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:17:50.990 --> 06:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
interaction between the pension system
 
06:17:53.770 --> 06:17:53.780 align:start position:0%
and the Deferred Compensation Plan
 
06:17:57.110 --> 06:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
they obviously we don't give advice on
 
06:18:01.788 --> 06:18:01.798 align:start position:0%
on the vice versa plans but if someone
 
06:18:04.310 --> 06:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
is talking about they have a huge leave
 
06:18:07.010 --> 06:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
balance the retirement system has been
 
06:18:09.830 --> 06:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
known to give them my phone number or
 
06:18:11.570 --> 06:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
talk to them about the Deferred
 
06:18:14.270 --> 06:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
conversation plan as a way to defer
 
06:18:18.948 --> 06:18:18.958 align:start position:0%
those leave balances likewise since
 
06:18:21.410 --> 06:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
we're doing in-person meetings and and
 
06:18:24.288 --> 06:18:24.298 align:start position:0%
did through all of last year and
 
06:18:26.448 --> 06:18:26.458 align:start position:0%
retirement system was at one point only
 
06:18:28.788 --> 06:18:28.798 align:start position:0%
doing web meetings we were passing out
 
06:18:31.430 --> 06:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
brochures to State Employees retiring
 
06:18:34.190 --> 06:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
that gives them a heads up and how they
 
06:18:36.770 --> 06:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
can plan to get the documents ready for
 
06:18:38.448 --> 06:18:38.458 align:start position:0%
their retirement with the pension system
 
06:18:41.110 --> 06:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
so there's a little bit of informal
 
06:18:44.868 --> 06:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
cooperation but other than that
 
06:18:48.708 --> 06:18:48.718 align:start position:0%
any state or political subdivision in
 
06:18:51.288 --> 06:18:51.298 align:start position:0%
the state can belong to the state plan
 
06:18:53.708 --> 06:18:53.718 align:start position:0%
and benefit from the
 
06:18:57.288 --> 06:18:57.298 align:start position:0%
448 million dollars in Assets in our
 
06:19:00.470 --> 06:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
plan so any town can join in their
 
06:19:02.990 --> 06:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
employers their employees get the same
 
06:19:05.628 --> 06:19:05.638 align:start position:0%
rates and Investments That a state
 
06:19:07.970 --> 06:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
employee can get and the reason I
 
06:19:10.310 --> 06:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned the amount of the plan
 
06:19:12.910 --> 06:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
even though it's way less uh
 
06:19:15.770 --> 06:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
when we we reached 500 million I started
 
06:19:17.930 --> 06:19:17.940 align:start position:0%
calling it a half a billion because it
 
06:19:20.390 --> 06:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
sounded like more money
 
06:19:20.400 --> 06:19:21.230 align:start position:0%
sounded like more money
um

06:19:21.230 --> 06:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:23.810 --> 06:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
even even though you're in the town of
 
06:19:25.910 --> 06:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
say a town with like you know two dozen
 
06:19:29.270 --> 06:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
employees you can get the states rate uh
 
06:19:32.208 --> 06:19:32.218 align:start position:0%
and benefit from the large Assets in the
 
06:19:34.430 --> 06:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
plan because that's how the costs are
 
06:19:37.250 --> 06:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
allocated in this the plane is currently
 
06:19:38.990 --> 06:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
out to bid
 
06:19:41.208 --> 06:19:41.218 align:start position:0%
um we have a we go through bids about
 
06:19:43.730 --> 06:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
five to seven years
 
06:19:46.310 --> 06:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
um right now you know we expect costs to
 
06:19:49.430 --> 06:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
drop about 25 percent with whoever the
 
06:19:52.250 --> 06:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
new company is even if we re-up with the
 
06:19:53.990 --> 06:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
current vendor
 
06:19:56.890 --> 06:19:56.900 align:start position:0%
um so as assets go up our costs go down
 
06:20:00.470 --> 06:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
most towns you know as I say the state
 
06:20:02.030 --> 06:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
did not promote this to its own
 
06:20:04.850 --> 06:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
employees or Municipal Employees but if
 
06:20:07.730 --> 06:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
you were to go into a town and sometimes
 
06:20:10.610 --> 06:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
some towns or cities have multiple plans
 
06:20:14.690 --> 06:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
our costs are half as much so literally
 
06:20:17.270 --> 06:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's we can give somebody a 50
 
06:20:19.670 --> 06:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
reduction in fees by transferring into
 
06:20:22.368 --> 06:20:22.378 align:start position:0%
our plan or establishing it so I don't
 
06:20:24.650 --> 06:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
know if one of your towns that you
 
06:20:27.890 --> 06:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
represent is on that list but if they're
 
06:20:30.048 --> 06:20:30.058 align:start position:0%
not you might have somebody give me a
 
06:20:30.058 --> 06:20:31.128 align:start position:0%
not you might have somebody give me a
call

06:20:31.128 --> 06:20:31.138 align:start position:0%
call
 
06:20:31.138 --> 06:20:32.750 align:start position:0%
call
there

06:20:32.750 --> 06:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:20:37.730 --> 06:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:39.530 --> 06:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
06:20:39.540 --> 06:20:40.670 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
Downey

06:20:40.670 --> 06:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
Downey
 
06:20:42.650 --> 06:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
um you said when you handed out this
 
06:20:45.048 --> 06:20:45.058 align:start position:0%
large piece of paper that we don't spend
 
06:20:48.530 --> 06:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
this much so presumably all the stuff at
 
06:20:50.628 --> 06:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
the top is your salary and your benefits
 
06:20:52.910 --> 06:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
and so on so you do spend that much so
 
06:20:56.510 --> 06:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
it's either the 45 000 or the 145 000 at
 
06:20:58.730 --> 06:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
the bottom that we're not spending is
 
06:21:04.310 --> 06:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:06.770 --> 06:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
I think we are I haven't got the exact
 
06:21:10.430 --> 06:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
cost but I think we we spent 20 226 000
 
06:21:12.110 --> 06:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
last year
 
06:21:14.330 --> 06:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
so that was significantly less because
 
06:21:17.030 --> 06:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
the contracts that I had budgeted came
 
06:21:19.670 --> 06:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
in well under budget
 
06:21:22.310 --> 06:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
which would be the 140 the last line yes
 
06:21:24.830 --> 06:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
there's about 50 000 in there that's
 
06:21:27.650 --> 06:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
that was more than great thank you very
 
06:21:27.660 --> 06:21:29.208 align:start position:0%
that was more than great thank you very
much

06:21:29.208 --> 06:21:29.218 align:start position:0%
much
 
06:21:30.890 --> 06:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding through GNC
 
06:21:30.900 --> 06:21:34.548 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding through GNC
contracts

06:21:34.548 --> 06:21:34.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:37.010 --> 06:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
06:21:41.208 --> 06:21:41.218 align:start position:0%
so I see as far as your investment asset
 
06:21:41.218 --> 06:21:42.708 align:start position:0%
so I see as far as your investment asset
breakdown

06:21:42.708 --> 06:21:42.718 align:start position:0%
breakdown
 
06:21:46.430 --> 06:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh 37 U.S stocks how does that compare
 
06:21:48.410 --> 06:21:48.420 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire retirement system
 
06:21:50.150 --> 06:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
do you happen to know or maybe Marty
 
06:21:54.048 --> 06:21:54.058 align:start position:0%
knows that's on the page two of six of
 
06:21:57.410 --> 06:21:57.420 align:start position:0%
