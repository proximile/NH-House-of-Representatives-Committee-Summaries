Allegiance I pledge aliance to the flag

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.390 align:start position:0%
 
nation

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
nation
 
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 align:start position:0%
harmony with that I'll open the continue
 
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
public hearings on B reform this morning
 
00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
I understand we have some folks here
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
from the county and I would uh invite
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
them to come up to the mic
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
first morning if you would introduce
 
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
yourselves and tell us um all you have
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
to tell us about baale
 
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:17.879 align:start position:0%
count one of the things that we had
 
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
talked about that we thought might be
 
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
helpful is just sort of talking about
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
the background of what happens when you
 
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.510 align:start position:0%
the background of what happens when you
get

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
arrested um essentially
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
there's there's a couple different ways
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
to get arrested If you're sort of caught
 
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
red-handed the police can take you into
 
00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:36.039 align:start position:0%
custody or they police May apply for an
 
00:07:37.869 --> 00:07:37.879 align:start position:0%
arrest warrant take you in a custody on
 
00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
the warrant but once you're arrested and
 
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
you're brought back to the police
 
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
station they go through a booking
 
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
process during that process um the
 
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
police are obligated to call a bail
 
00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner there's a a statute in New
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which requires the police to
 
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
to notify a bail commissioner and notify
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
a a arreste that they have the right to
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
a bail commissioner
 
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:03.080 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner is supposed to
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
respond to the police department and
 
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
essentially sets bail on the arreste the
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner has a couple of
 
00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
choices they can set preventative
 
00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:13.879 align:start position:0%
detention they can set cash bail or they
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
can release the person on personal
 
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
recognizance the if a person is held
 
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
meaning either held on preventative
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
detention or held on cash bail they're
 
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
entitled to a hearing within 24 hours
 
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:31.720 align:start position:0%
except weekends in front of a judge
 
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
where a judge would decide bail or
 
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not bail is appropriate and
 
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
at that hearing the complaints would
 
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
have been filed already in the court
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
there'd be a prosecutor there and
 
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
potentially a defense
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
attorney if the person's released on
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
personal recognizance bail the bail
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner gives the arreste an
 
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
arraignment date there's one of the
 
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
rules of criminal procedure indicates
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
that that arraignment date shall be no
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
sooner than 35 days from the date of
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
arrest so if you're arrested October 1st
 
00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
your arraignment date is going to be at
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
least November 6 and can be further out
 
00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:11.110 align:start position:0%
least November 6 and can be further out
than

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
that if personal recognizance bail is
 
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
set what ends up happening is the police
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
department then transfers that paperwork
 
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
to the prosecutor's office or files the
 
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
complaints in court there's a rule that
 
00:09:26.069 --> 00:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
says the complaints have to be filed no
 
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
more than 14 or no less than 14 days
 
00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:31.399 align:start position:0%
prior to arraignment so again in that
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
October 1 scenario we would be filing
 
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.269 align:start position:0%
October 1 scenario we would be filing
the

00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
complaints no less than 14 days before
 
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
that November 6
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
arraignment what that means is that
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
there's a a gap in time often between if
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
a bail commissioner releases someone on
 
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
personal recognizance bail and when that
 
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
case is actually received and reviewed
 
00:09:51.389 --> 00:09:51.399 align:start position:0%
by a
 
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
prosecutor um there are
 
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
certainly Provisions in the statute that
 
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
IND indicate if the state feels that
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
personal recognizance bail was
 
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
inappropriately set we can file a motion
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
to have that bail reviewed by the court
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
the the statute indicates that review
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
should happen within I believe it's 48
 
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
Hours the the difficulty is that there's
 
00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:21.399 align:start position:0%
already that Gap that's occurred within
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
those 35 days so we're not immediately
 
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
hearing about the pr Veil
 
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.030 align:start position:0%
hearing about the pr Veil
usually

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
usually
 
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
um once the person is arraigned in court
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
on their regular arraignment the court
 
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
can modify bail I would indicate that
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
that at least in my experience has been
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
very seldom will the court modify bail
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
at a at a normal arraignment people can
 
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
file motions for for bail review the
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
defense can file a motion for bail
 
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
review the state can file a motion for
 
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:52.120 align:start position:0%
bail review again it's been my
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
experience that if the defense files a
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
motion to have bail reviewed that's
 
00:10:59.550 --> 00:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
generally held within 24 hours um my
 
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
experience as the state has been that
 
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
when I filed motions for bail review
 
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
it's been significantly longer to get
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
them scheduled than 24 hours um so
 
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:13.240 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the the background of of
 
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
where you start if if I may to Jack yeah
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
one of the ideas we've contemplated is
 
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
giving the prosecutors the ability to
 
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
appeal and the defendant on certain
 
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
limited enumerated um crimes be held
 
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
pending that appeal um if it's in the
 
00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:32.519 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court to the superior court and
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
that seems pretty clearcut the question
 
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
I have is how often are these already in
 
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
the superior court and
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
um what would then be the Avenue of
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
appeal all that's left to the Supreme
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
Court which would clog their calendar
 
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
insignificantly so there's already a
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
statute that allows the prosecutor to
 
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
appeal a bill commissioner's decision
 
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
whether it's in circuit court or
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
Superior Court I me the judge's decision
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
so you'd appeal the judge's decision to
 
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
so at arraignment or at the first
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
appearance the judge doesn't modify PR
 
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
bail and the and the prosecutor objects
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
yeah um Expediting that appeal to no
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
more than 48 hours to Superior Court and
 
00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
the defendant beh
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
held you could what were your thoughts
 
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.590 align:start position:0%
held you could what were your thoughts
on

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
that I don't see a problem with that
 
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily other than would you be
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
having super Superior Court
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
judges for lack of a better term second
 
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
guessing other Superior Court judges
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
that was my question if if it started in
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
so with the end of felonies first more
 
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
of your arraignments are going to ur cir
 
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:41.720 align:start position:0%
circuit course so that would
 
00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
significantly imp impact that but how
 
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
many do start in spor court right now
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
all felonies start in Superior Court
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
right so the the superior the felony
 
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
level bail prior to felony first being
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
um eliminated starts in Superior Court
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
so you'd have you have Superior Court
 
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
judges in the first instance setting
 
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.350 align:start position:0%
judges in the first instance setting
those

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
bailes in terms of having an appeal to
 
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court there's there's
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
already a statute 5976 that talks about
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
an appeal to the Supreme Court it says
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
it shall be determined
 
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
promptly I think that promptly to the
 
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court means something different
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
than promptly to most other people as
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
soon as we can maybe um I know that the
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
the case up in uh Coos County where the
 
00:13:33.629 --> 00:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
individual had hit the
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists had appealed his bail to
 
00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:38.519 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and I think that that
 
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
appeal was resolved in a like four to
 
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
six month period which I think may be
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
prompt for the Supreme Court but
 
00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
certainly doesn't meet the
 
00:13:49.079 --> 00:13:51.509 align:start position:0%
certainly doesn't meet the
colloquial

00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
colloquial
 
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
prompt and there's a there's a question
 
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
too is if you have a appeal to to a
 
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
suprem circuit court order within 48
 
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
hours that there be an evidentiary
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
hearing um that requires
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
Witnesses I think each side if that's
 
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.189 align:start position:0%
Witnesses I think each side if that's
the

00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
issue may or may not have difficulty
 
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
getting appropriate witnesses there
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
within 48 Hours well again with the end
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
of felonies first I'm foreseeing
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
hopefully within within the year the the
 
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
arrangements in the first instance even
 
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
for felonies would begin in the circuit
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
court again so it would be an appeal to
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
the Su um to the uh Superior Court which
 
00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:34.519 align:start position:0%
would be much more doable and reasonable
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
and as I indicated 59760 already has
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
that process in place but it doesn't
 
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
have the hold in place like you said and
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
that would be only in an extremely
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
limited series I mean it wouldn't be
 
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
able to request it on every case but in
 
00:14:48.749 --> 00:14:48.759 align:start position:0%
limited number of cases that were
 
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
violent or danger to the public that the
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
um the prosecuting attorney could say we
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
just don't agree your honoring we'd like
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
it to be
 
00:14:59.069 --> 00:14:59.079 align:start position:0%
reviewed so barring getting into the
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
Quagmire of the Supreme Court it's it's
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
certainly a doable idea then you would
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
it help the state in keeping more people
 
00:15:10.269 --> 00:15:10.279 align:start position:0%
off of the street and probably shouldn't
 
00:15:10.279 --> 00:15:11.550 align:start position:0%
off of the street and probably shouldn't
be

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959 align:start position:0%
then potentially I that's why I ask as
 
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm thinking through what you're
 
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
saying as you're saying it
 
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
um I think you could certainly have a
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
statute that stays the decision of the
 
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court pending the appeal so if
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
the person was held and the circuit
 
00:15:33.069 --> 00:15:33.079 align:start position:0%
court judge said personal recognizance
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
bail you could appeal that and stay that
 
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
personal recognizance bail pending the
 
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
appeal I think it becomes more
 
00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:42.279 align:start position:0%
problematic to say that the person's
 
00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
held pending an appeal when they were
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
free when they were free um because you
 
00:15:48.309 --> 00:15:48.319 align:start position:0%
could certainly have a situation where a
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
person is granted PR bail by the bail
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner comes into court is granted
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
PR bail by the judge and then having the
 
00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
state say we're going to appeal that
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
having them automatically held I think
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
could be potentially problematic and to
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
along that same line granting the
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
ability of the police to appeal a bail
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner's decision likewise with a
 
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
very limited set of criminal where they
 
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
would be held yeah um but within the
 
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
same 24 hours except for requiring the
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
court to hold hearings over the weekend
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
um so that it wouldn't make them stay
 
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
over the weekend maybe I misunderstood
 
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
what you just said but if they're held
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
with they're in front of a judge the
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
next day any unless it's a weekend right
 
00:16:34.309 --> 00:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
what I'm contemplating is requiring the
 
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
courts to hold some type of a bear
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
review over the weekend the question is
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
would that would that trigger the full
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
panoply in other words would they get a
 
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:44.360 align:start position:0%
defense Council would they get Witnesses
 
00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
or could it just be a simple review of a
 
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner's
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
parte I I don't think you could
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily do it expart I think you
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
could have a review of the Bill
 
00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.949 align:start position:0%
could have a review of the Bill
commissioner's

00:16:59.949 --> 00:16:59.959 align:start position:0%
commissioner's
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
decision um within 24 hours even on
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
weekends the the sort of
 
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
practical difficulty with that is we
 
00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:15.079 align:start position:0%
don't work on weekends tends to be the
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
the the difficulty is um you know we
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
were talking earlier that prosecutors
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
tend to be salaried judges tend to be
 
00:17:26.669 --> 00:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
salaried um I think you'd potentially
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
have to have that be an open hearing
 
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:31.160 align:start position:0%
hearing a public hearing which means
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
you'd have to have it in a courthouse
 
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
with court security where the public was
 
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
allowed to attend I I would question so
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
I and I know this it's a different state
 
00:17:42.909 --> 00:17:42.919 align:start position:0%
but it still falls under the same um
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights overall I know in
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they have something called
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
the Jenkins rule where if someone's to
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
be held more than 24 hours a judge
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
telephonically speaks with the police as
 
00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
a review and and all those um other
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
hearing rights aren't triggered and I
 
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
think in that case you you'd essentially
 
00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:03.559 align:start position:0%
be having the judge setting bail indeed
 
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
yeah right in Li of uh if the police
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
objected to propos personal recognizance
 
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
the police said well we would like the
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
judge to do it yeah um and that may
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
which would eleviate the second concern
 
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
of having to take someone into custody
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
at court who was already free right no
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
have again the status quo in place which
 
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
is that the person is in custody and
 
00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:34.919 align:start position:0%
then have an on call Judge review that
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
bail decision or set bail because we
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
already have judges issuing emergency U
 
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
protection orders over the weekend if a
 
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
judge were to say okay every Saturday
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
morning I'll hold bail hearings for two
 
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
hours or or whatever they end up working
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
out and I do plan obviously to speak
 
00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
with the Supreme Court Justice about
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
this but it's it's just ideas that are
 
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
bouncing around yeah I think there's a
 
00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
difference between the initial um
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
imposition of bail by a by a judge
 
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
versus an appeal by a judge and um I
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
going back a little bit to your question
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
about um uh doing it exp parte uh I I
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
don't think that's a good idea uh
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
frankly I think it's a bad idea because
 
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
it it um it stops the accountability of
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
the individual who's setting the bail
 
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
which I think is needs to be open and
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
and and clear to to Outsiders someone
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
who's not involved in the process should
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
be able watch that process uh and um uh
 
00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
that's the main the main concern that I
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
have it should be open and clear for the
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
continuity but if it's in lie of the
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner if it's initial
 
00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
setting I think it's a it's a it's a
 
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
it's a difference okay because the
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
initial setting you're able to appeal in
 
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
front of a judge in which case it would
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
be it would be in open court during Open
 
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
Session uh the initial setting at a bail
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
may be at 11: at night um and uh it it
 
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
would be appealed to the next or
 
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
reviewed in the next session however and
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
again this would be extremely limited
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
set of crimes and it may be a
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
distinction without a difference in
 
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
terms of X parte because when the bail
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner is there generally the
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
defendant is going to be sitting in
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
front of them and the police are going
 
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
to be there as well so okay but a right
 
00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
to councel hasn't yet attached is the
 
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
question there is no right to counsel
 
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
before the bail commissioner just
 
00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
because one is a judge versus a there is
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
no the council until the complaint is
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
filed there we go thank you please go on
 
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
I didn't mean to interrupt if I threw
 
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
you off track I
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
Apologize have anything else I I mean I
 
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
have nothing else I'm happy to answer
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
questions or well one of the concerns
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
that we've discussed is you know um in
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
in the Senate Bill the one of the ones
 
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
that we're contemplating here they have
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
a list of 13 crimes I'm sure you're
 
00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
familiar with it it's our impression
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
that it's not those 13 crimes that are
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
driving the public consternation with
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
the bail situation it's the repeated uh
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
nuisance crimes it's the trespass it's
 
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
the shoplifting it's a disorderly person
 
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
that are occurring while people are on
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
bail again and
 
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
again what are your your information can
 
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
you give us about that well and I think
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
another part of their frustration with
 
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
the bail system is non- appearances in
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
court um in Marram County Superior Court
 
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
everyone who's arrested released on
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
personal recognizance bail is given an
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
arraignment date for their felony those
 
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
arraignments occur on Thursday afternoon
 
00:21:31.149 --> 00:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
so yesterday we had an arraignment
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
session there were 13 cases scheduled
 
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
for arraignment yesterday out of those
 
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.590 align:start position:0%
for arraignment yesterday out of those
13

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
13
 
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
cases uh four of those individuals had
 
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
obtained counsel so the four individuals
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
that had obtained Council three of them
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
waved their arraignment one continued
 
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
their arraignment which leaves nine of
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
those 13
 
00:21:59.230 --> 00:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
cases and and we could play any guesses
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
on how many people actually showed up of
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
the nine of the nine
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
one so we had one person show up for
 
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
their arraignment and eight failures to
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
appear yesterday all bench warrants
 
00:22:18.029 --> 00:22:18.039 align:start position:0%
issue yes on felony level PR fails and I
 
00:22:18.039 --> 00:22:19.310 align:start position:0%
issue yes on felony level PR fails and I
think

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's a frustration hopefully
 
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
event war chch did the judge did the
 
00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
judge that you know of set um conditions
 
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
if they were picked up on the warrant so
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
we would request bench warrants with um
 
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
no Bail no
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
bail so theoretically when they're
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
picked up they'd be a hearing in front
 
00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:42.039 align:start position:0%
of a judge within 24 hours to set
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
conditions of bail and set bail um the
 
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
frustration is that a lot of those
 
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
people get picked up and get released
 
00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
again on personal recognizance bail or
 
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
get released on you know bail with with
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
conditions and we may find out that
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
they're violating the conditions of bail
 
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
and file a motion to revoke bail and and
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
the frustration again becomes that those
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
motions aren't necessarily heard in a
 
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
timely fashion um it may take I've
 
00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
certainly had the experience where the
 
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
court holds the motion for 10 days to
 
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
wait for defense Council to respond and
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
then by the time the judge gets it it's
 
00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
10 days old and the judge says well
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll schedule a hearing and I may
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
get a hearing 30 45 days out to revoke
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
bail to revoke bail so and inevitably
 
00:23:37.269 --> 00:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
the defendant doesn't show up at their
 
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
motion to revoke bail hearing and we get
 
00:23:42.029 --> 00:23:42.039 align:start position:0%
a no bail bench warrant
 
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
um how often is no bail set on the bench
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
warrants for failure to appear fairly
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
often um we do have a lot of bench
 
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
warrants with with no bail set um and I
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's in my experience and correct me
 
00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong I think that's almost the
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
default for our Superior Court judges at
 
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
least in marrat county that their
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
feeling is you have to go in front of a
 
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
judge since a bench has been issued and
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
you may get PR as a result of that
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
hearing but initially you're going to be
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
held no bail pending that least the
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
warrant's going to issue for no bail um
 
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
I I would point out that that the
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
attorneys in the office if they get a
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
call if the person doesn't show up no
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
one knows where is where that person is
 
00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
um and a Nobel warrant issues by the
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
court uh if something happens two three
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
four five days later defense attorney
 
00:24:39.149 --> 00:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
calls the uh involved prosecutor and
 
00:24:41.389 --> 00:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
says hey I found out what what happened
 
00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:44.200 align:start position:0%
and they and they have a a valid reason
 
00:24:46.389 --> 00:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
for it uh the attorneys in the office
 
00:24:48.389 --> 00:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
are are pretty flexible about agreeing
 
00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
to reschedule to vacate a warrant and to
 
00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
reschedule if there's a reason um but uh
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
I think Steve's right that the the vast
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
majority the initiation are a are a hold
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
or cash one if you could how how often
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
um do you does it come to your attention
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
that these defendants are are homeless
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
they don't have an address
 
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
um it's fairly common frequent yeah
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
matter of fact I just got I saw a
 
00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:21.559 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet the other day from conquer
 
00:25:24.909 --> 00:25:24.919 align:start position:0%
Police Department that talked about um
 
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
the uh frequency of of arrest on new
 
00:25:32.389 --> 00:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
charges breach of bail and U failures to
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
appear um on benchmarks um for uh folks
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
that don't have a a have more of a fluid
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
address they don't have a static address
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
and um the numbers I saw covered I Ted
 
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
them up last night from January 1st of
 
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
22 to August 16th um there were several
 
00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:56.200 align:start position:0%
hundred entries but there were 113 bench
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
warrants between January and middle of
 
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
August um and my interpretation of the
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet was those bench warrants
 
00:26:05.789 --> 00:26:05.799 align:start position:0%
were not new warrants for new arrest
 
00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
there were bench Wars for not appearance
 
00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
in in courts uh and there were 39
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
breaches of bail for non compliance with
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
the court orders now there may be some
 
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
overlap with those numbers um but those
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
are the uh those are the numbers from
 
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
Just One Police Department in uh in um
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:26:27.149 --> 00:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
county the other thing I I also did a
 
00:26:27.159 --> 00:26:28.190 align:start position:0%
county the other thing I I also did a
quick

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
quick
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
email to the attorneys before I came
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
today uh last couple days I got some
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
responses about how the their request
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
for warrants and requests for um uh
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
revocation of bails being processed by
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
the superior court and um I can give you
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
a couple examples just just um the
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
feedback I got back um one individual
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
five open cases seven failur to appear
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
uh and um the the concern there is case
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
of seven failures to appear um a motion
 
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
to revoke was filed on five failures to
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
appear um one person from a 2020 case
 
00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
had a cash bail issued of $1,000 that
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
was posted after failures to appear the
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh the state uh did a motion with the
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
court to Forfeit
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
the, uh back in April of 2023 we've yet
 
00:27:24.029 --> 00:27:24.039 align:start position:0%
to have that scheduled Court's not been
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
not been scheduling that um in uh in
 
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
distri Court uh after four failures to
 
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
appear $300 cash bail warrant was issued
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
but again the judge held that for 10
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
days I I assume uh in keeping with what
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
Steve mentioned a moment ago that was
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
probably time for defense Council to get
 
00:27:45.549 --> 00:27:45.559 align:start position:0%
information about the individual one
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
attorney filed a motion to revoke in
 
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
June filed it electronically it was
 
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
filed on June 22nd it was not accepted
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
by the court till July
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
18th almost a month accepted they file
 
00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
electronically court has to accept it
 
00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
prior to that movement along within the
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
court system so even acknowledging that
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
they received the the electronic filing
 
00:28:05.549 --> 00:28:05.559 align:start position:0%
took a month they they didn't
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that for just shy of a month
 
00:28:12.269 --> 00:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
um uh another individual dating back to
 
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
2020 failed to appear back in 2020
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
picked up on the August uh I mentioned
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
him the guy
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
from non appearance out of state uh
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
motion to revoke baale had got awall
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
from pre-trial Services another attorney
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
is seven motions for Action without uh
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
checking with pre-trial Services
 
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
whereabouts are unknown um from my
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
perspective talking with the attorneys
 
00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:38.919 align:start position:0%
there appears to be a big continuity
 
00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
issue with the judges and the courts how
 
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
fast they accept it how fast they
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
schedule it going back to what attorney
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
endress mentioned a moment ago um
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
defense attorneys file a motion to
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
review bail they get 24 48 Hours one or
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
two days it's in front of a judge uh the
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
state files a motion to revoke a motion
 
00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
to amend we won't see a notice for that
 
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:02.200 align:start position:0%
maybe for or a court schedule two weeks
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
two and a half weeks if if they even
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
accept the the uh pleading in a timely
 
00:29:10.269 --> 00:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
manner um there's no continuity and uh I
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
think that the system in my opinion
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
system works generally well the way it's
 
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:17.480 align:start position:0%
set up but there's a lot of loose ends
 
00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
in the system that public policy-wise
 
00:29:23.789 --> 00:29:23.799 align:start position:0%
need to be need to be tightened up so
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing so far isn't
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily any kind of repudiation of
 
00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
the bail statutes themselves as much as
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
the way the system interacts within
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
within its own pieces and and I think
 
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
that's true I as why I I don't think the
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
bail statute is fundamentally flawed as
 
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's written I think it's got a lot of
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
good stuff in it the the difficulty is
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of discretion along
 
00:29:52.029 --> 00:29:52.039 align:start position:0%
that road um and that's what we'd like
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
to maybe do is fine-tune not right one
 
00:29:57.389 --> 00:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
of the one of the things that always
 
00:30:00.909 --> 00:30:00.919 align:start position:0%
sort of struck me was that there's a
 
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
massive amount of training required to
 
00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:04.039 align:start position:0%
become a police officer in the state of
 
00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they go through the
 
00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:07.399 align:start position:0%
academy they go through field training
 
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
so you have very highly trained police
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
officers in terms of becoming a judge I
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
don't think there's any requirements but
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
you get appointed by the governor I
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
think all the judges in New Hampshire at
 
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:21.640 align:start position:0%
this point are attorneys you have highly
 
00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:24.519 align:start position:0%
experienced intelligent judges you have
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
highly experienced intelligent
 
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.789 align:start position:0%
highly experienced intelligent
prosecutors

00:30:27.789 --> 00:30:27.799 align:start position:0%
prosecutors
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
and what always struck me as odd among
 
00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:33.799 align:start position:0%
that system is the person who decides
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
whether you go home at night after
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
you've been arrested is the bail
 
00:30:39.789 --> 00:30:39.799 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the educational
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
requirements for bail Commissioners in
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
the statute are a yearly meeting and a
 
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner handbook there's
 
00:30:47.159 --> 00:30:48.029 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner handbook there's
there's

00:30:48.029 --> 00:30:48.039 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
no there's no 100 hours of training
 
00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no educational
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
requirements there and I'm not saying
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
that the bail Commissioners aren't
 
00:30:58.629 --> 00:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
trying to do good job or doing a good
 
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
job but there's there's a huge amount of
 
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
discretion there and you have people
 
00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919 align:start position:0%
from various backgrounds I know
 
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
throughout my career as a prosecutor
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
there was a time when most bail
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
Commissioners were retired police
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
officers um that's changed and there was
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
a time when most bail Commissioners were
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
Court Personnel who had been appointed
 
00:31:23.149 --> 00:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
to be bail
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
Commissioners so there's there's a wide
 
00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
variety of people who are in that
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
role and I think that they're given an
 
00:31:33.149 --> 00:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
incredible amount of
 
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
discretion with very little sort of
 
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
objective criteria to say uh you know
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
here's a a form or here's something to
 
00:31:44.909 --> 00:31:44.919 align:start position:0%
consider in terms of if you get so many
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
points you're held or you're not held
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
yeah and to their credit the bill
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
Commissioners themselves have asked for
 
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
more training and more continuity in
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
their training um and and we are taking
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
that very seriously as well
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
but also you mentioned that many bail
 
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
decisions of the Commissioners aren't
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
being overturned so we can at least
 
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:06.200 align:start position:0%
assume arguendo that the decision was
 
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
correct or at least not so far off the
 
00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
bounds that it cried out for reversal
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
and and I don't disagree with that and I
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
it's it's sort of a cyclical thing where
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
what ends up happening is if a bail
 
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner sets personal recognizance
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
bail like I was saying there's this
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
there's this lag between when I get it
 
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
as a prosecutor if I file a motion
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
saying the commissioner got this totally
 
00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:30.799 align:start position:0%
wrong and I end up in front of the judge
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
and the defendant appears the argument's
 
00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:36.039 align:start position:0%
going to be he's been good he's been
 
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
right he's been good for 30 days and
 
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
he's here now yeah obviously PR was the
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
so it's in the one time it wasn't the
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
correct decision it's the one time or
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
the two times it's and I think that
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
there's different between the person
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
who's released on personal recognizance
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
bail and commits further crime and the
 
00:33:00.909 --> 00:33:00.919 align:start position:0%
difference between the person who's
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
released on personal recognizance bail
 
00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
and doesn't come to court because you
 
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
know for lack of a better term their
 
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
life is a mess and getting somewhere on
 
00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
a day they're supposed to be there is
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
virtually an impossibility for that
 
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
person well that that brings us back to
 
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
the original well the two original
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
you're held because you're a danger or
 
00:33:23.789 --> 00:33:23.799 align:start position:0%
because you're a Flight Risk if you
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
don't show up you're a Flight Risk if
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
you repeatedly don't show up corre and
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
if you are but the question becomes then
 
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
the danger on one level we discuss
 
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
danger as in you know are they going to
 
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:38.200 align:start position:0%
hurt somebody but the continued breach
 
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
of the public peace in my mind is also
 
00:33:42.629 --> 00:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
on on a certain level of danger if they
 
00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
keep getting arrested for shoplifting if
 
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
they keep trespassing it eats police
 
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
resources it eats Court resources um it
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
puts police in danger every time they
 
00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
have to take someone in custody so the
 
00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:56.200 align:start position:0%
the question is how do we how do we and
 
00:33:58.029 --> 00:33:58.039 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to put you on the spot yeah
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
but if any suggestions from you who are
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
in the trenches would be greatly
 
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
appreciated on how we could fine-tune
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
that yeah I I agree with you that I
 
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
think multiple faes to appear does put
 
00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:12.599 align:start position:0%
you in in danger I think that there's a
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
certain level of sort of personal
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
debilitation that comes with um being
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
arrested multiple times and I think this
 
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
sort of overlaps too in a little bit of
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
like the the mental health system them
 
00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
but we have people who you know fail to
 
00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
appear keep committing crimes get
 
00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
arrested end up being held in jail and
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
that's the argument that they're a
 
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
danger to themselves because they
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
essentially can't live harmoniously in
 
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
society as as we've established it um I
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
don't know where that line is where you
 
00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
be you've become a danger from multiple
 
00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:57.640 align:start position:0%
failures to appear but but I I've
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
certainly made that argument in the past
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
um the what about Services because as we
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
we've established or I believe the
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
record has established that the majority
 
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
of people that are picked up like that
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
are in need of service either substance
 
00:35:16.589 --> 00:35:16.599 align:start position:0%
or mental health no doubt doubt so what
 
00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
what what is available I heard you
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
mention pre- Services could you tell the
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
committee what that is and what what's
 
00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
involved with that so in in Marram
 
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
County we have a pre-trial services
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
program where
 
00:35:32.349 --> 00:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
you you're subject to essentially
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
pre-trial monitoring for it's almost
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
like a pre-trial probation for lack of a
 
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:37.750 align:start position:0%
like a pre-trial probation for lack of a
better

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.630 align:start position:0%
better
term

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
um there are there are components to
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
pre-trial Services you have to check in
 
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
those check-ins at this point I believe
 
00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:49.670 align:start position:0%
those check-ins at this point I believe
are

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:35:53.309 --> 00:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
telephonic um there was a time when
 
00:35:56.309 --> 00:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
pre-trial Services would do home visits
 
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
I don't believe they're doing those
 
00:35:59.790 --> 00:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
anymore that's stopped around Co time
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
yeah any plans to take it back up um I I
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
think there is but within marac County
 
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
the pre-trial Services folks used to be
 
00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
uh sworn deputies the pre-trial Services
 
00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
changed their wiring diagram within the
 
00:36:15.309 --> 00:36:15.319 align:start position:0%
county um and I think they're going
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
through the certification now through I
 
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
want to say Corrections U because the
 
00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
concern is that that if they go to
 
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
someone's house you know we're dealing
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
with individuals
 
00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
who are in front of the criminal justice
 
00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
system and that may not be receptive to
 
00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
having someone coming to their home and
 
00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
um having a single person who's unarmed
 
00:36:38.349 --> 00:36:38.359 align:start position:0%
going to A A Home of someone who doesn't
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
want them there uh may be problematic so
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
I think they're in the process of
 
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
reestablishing some some way to allow
 
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
the individuals to to protect themselves
 
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
what about drug screening while they're
 
00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
on this they do so they do urine screens
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
while you're on pre-trial Services um
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
they offer drug counseling um electronic
 
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
monitoring right we can do electronic
 
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
monitoring which can include a GPS
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
bracelet so that you can sort of
 
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
geofence people to say you can't go to
 
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
certain locations and there would be an
 
00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
alarm if they went within a certain
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
distance of a
 
00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.829 align:start position:0%
distance of a
location

00:37:16.829 --> 00:37:16.839 align:start position:0%
location
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
um there's also a requirement that
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
you're employed or in school during
 
00:37:23.119 --> 00:37:24.670 align:start position:0%
you're employed or in school during
pre-trial

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
pre-trial
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
services so the the court
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
the courts certainly have that
 
00:37:33.309 --> 00:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
available I
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
think for me one of the difficulties
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
with with some of the pre-trial programs
 
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.470 align:start position:0%
with with some of the pre-trial programs
is

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
that the idea behind it is that we're
 
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
going to take people who would otherwise
 
00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.309 align:start position:0%
going to take people who would otherwise
be

00:37:48.309 --> 00:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and put them on pre-trial
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
services and allow them in the
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
community but the reality is that what
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
ends up happening is you have people
 
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
that would otherwise be out on personal
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
recognizance bail unsupervised are the
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
ones that at least in my opinion make up
 
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
the majority of pre-trial
 
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
Services um and I think those are the
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
people that really could could benefit
 
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
from pre-trial Services I you know
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
certainly there's I I I'm sure someone
 
00:38:20.349 --> 00:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
behind me will mention that and probably
 
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
knows far more about this than I do but
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
there was some program in New York City
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
where they simply texted people the day
 
00:38:28.109 --> 00:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
before their court date and their
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
failures to appear drop drastically and
 
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
I think that one of the benefits of
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
pre-trial Services is you have someone
 
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
there to remind you of your court date
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
and to say we want to make sure you're
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
going to court tomorrow and you know and
 
00:38:42.109 --> 00:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
you know exactly where they are if they
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
we anle bracelet yeah you also mentioned
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
Services generally um I know that over
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
the last year or so in Mar County um the
 
00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
Human Services folks have R redesigned
 
00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
their their structure uh and they have
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
now a um it's called a county Navigator
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
Pro program which takes referrals
 
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
they'll take referrals from law
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement self referrals uh public
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
defender defense councils you don't have
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
to be law enforcement involved to get a
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
referral to them and they'll help
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
navigate the the services within marrat
 
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
County help people establish
 
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
appointments um seek housing food
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
assistance medical assistance items such
 
00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
as that it's working very very well they
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
also do uh drug assistance um you
 
00:39:28.309 --> 00:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
remember when the opioid money started
 
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
coming from the opioid lawsuits started
 
00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
coming some of that was earmarked to to
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
my office um but because of the
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
requirements within a statute I didn't
 
00:39:38.589 --> 00:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
have a program I could plug that money
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
into um I worked with with the Human
 
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
Services folks moved that money from my
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
budget to theirs along with addition
 
00:39:46.309 --> 00:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
they received I understand additional
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
opioid money and that helps fund some of
 
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
the uh um the medical treatment and the
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
drugs treatment um sub abuse treatment
 
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
and mental health treatment that's
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
available through your Navigator program
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
or at least the referral process and uh
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh and back filling costs so it
 
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
sounds like Marat county has some really
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
Innovative good things going on the
 
00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
problem is that we write statutes that
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
cover the whole state so if the other
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
counties don't have it it's an unfunded
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
mandate and it's a problem right and at
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
this point the pre-trial Services
 
00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
Program is a county by count right
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
program right but ours is pretty robust
 
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact I think they just
 
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
recently won uh the Navigator program
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
and Human Service just recently won an
 
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
award um national award uh for their uh
 
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
for their for their programming so it's
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
pretty robust it's pretty robust at this
 
00:40:34.589 --> 00:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
point I'd like to open it up to members
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
of the committee to ask questions anyone
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
have any since I've been hogging all the
 
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
time can I make one more comment oh
 
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely by by all means um going back
 
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit you had talked about um we
 
00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
had talked about the baale statute
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
pretty much the way it's written is
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
workable there needs to be some some
 
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
tweaks to it I know some of the
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
considerations that you mentioned were
 
00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
getting the people who are uh multiple
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
failures to appear in front of a in
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
front of a judge rather than in front of
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
a bail commissioner um remember bail
 
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are a
 
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
statutory um their duties are outlined
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
by Statute uh there is a way to that you
 
00:41:15.069 --> 00:41:15.079 align:start position:0%
may want to consider of um with certain
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
parameters bail Commissioners unable to
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
set bail it goes in front of a Judicial
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
officer the next day under the bail
 
00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner statute uh limit their
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
authority to set bail rather than than
 
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
change the bail statute as it is say
 
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
under these circumstances an individual
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
who's on release from Department of
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
Corrections uh or on bail for two or
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
more a ausm or felonies uh and
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
rearrested must go uh they cannot set
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
bail or someone who has committed one of
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
these crimes is charged with one of
 
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
these crimes the bail commissioner
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
cannot set bail that triggers it going
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
before bail a Judicial officer the very
 
00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:53.240 align:start position:0%
next morning and that leaves the bail
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
statute as it is and just limits the
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners and just directs
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
those in most in need of attention where
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
they should be Judes Could you um would
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
you mind emailing that to the committee
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
that suggestion I will I will with the
 
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
statuto notation I will um questions uh
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
representative um I just had a quick
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
question um you part of my past
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
experience involves um uh helping large
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
organizations convert paper based
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
processes to electronic processes and
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that can gum up the
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
works like nothing else are some
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
important processes continuing to be on
 
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
paper while other important processes uh
 
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
continue to be
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
electronic one of the things that I'm
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
really curious about in this situation
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
after having listened to you go through
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
uh some of the delays and in processing
 
00:42:52.829 --> 00:42:52.839 align:start position:0%
I mean to to what extent are are we
 
00:42:52.839 --> 00:42:54.309 align:start position:0%
I mean to to what extent are are we
talking

00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:42:57.069 --> 00:42:57.079 align:start position:0%
about the court system
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
operating in the
 
00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
1990s while the rest of us are operating
 
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
2020s maybe I I I yes I I don't want to
 
00:43:10.589 --> 00:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
give I don't want to give the impression
 
00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
it's all a paperwork electronic work sna
 
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
Fu um certainly some of it is is is or
 
00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
may be Staffing I don't know the
 
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
Staffing I don't talk to the AOC about
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
their about their Staffing but when uh
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
my understanding from the super from
 
00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
talking with some of the folks that deal
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
with the Superior Court more directly
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
nighted meeting the attorneys who file
 
00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:33.640 align:start position:0%
things they prioritize what they're
 
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
accepting in their electronic filing I
 
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
think that that my outside view looking
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
prioritization is is warranted but the
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
ability to get through those priorities
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
is staff-driven
 
00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
and U that 20 that 30 days to accept a
 
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
request for a motion roke bail is
 
00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
probably staff driven because they had
 
00:43:59.950 --> 00:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
all these other priorities to get
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
through and right right all those other
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
priorities to get through so they
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't get to that individual priority
 
00:44:07.549 --> 00:44:07.559 align:start position:0%
and attorney Anderson and I were talking
 
00:44:09.069 --> 00:44:09.079 align:start position:0%
before we came in I'll let him elaborate
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
on on on this a little bit more um there
 
00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
seems the state seems to have developed
 
00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:15.710 align:start position:0%
seems the state seems to have developed
their

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:19.640 align:start position:0%
electronic databases and systems
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
independent of one another to the point
 
00:44:23.069 --> 00:44:23.079 align:start position:0%
where there are several and I don't know
 
00:44:25.549 --> 00:44:25.559 align:start position:0%
if they're all talking to one another um
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
I know
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
right so right now in Circuit Court
 
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
everything is
 
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
paper so misdemeanor
 
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
violations all that is is paper and it's
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
the same system now that it was 20 30 40
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
years ago so the bail commissioner fills
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
out a
 
00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
form and gives you your court date on
 
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
like here's your paper form court date
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
and then the bail commissioner has to
 
00:44:55.319 --> 00:44:56.630 align:start position:0%
and then the bail commissioner has to
then

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:44:59.549 --> 00:44:59.559 align:start position:0%
get themselves to the court to give the
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
other copy of that paper to the court so
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
the court knows this is when it's
 
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
on um it's I believe it's still a a
 
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
three-piece you know pink yellow white
 
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
form where the yellow copy goes to the
 
00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:17.319 align:start position:0%
police the pink copy goes to the
 
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
defendant the white copy goes to the
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
court um in Superior Court they've got
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
electronic filing
 
00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
that I don't believe the bail paperwork
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
is being electronically filed I think
 
00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:34.630 align:start position:0%
is being electronically filed I think
that's

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
still yeah probably varies based on
 
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
where you are um and then the Supreme
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
Court has an electronic filing system
 
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
that's different than the superior
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
Court's electronic filing system so you
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
need a separate login to get to the
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court rather than Superior Court
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
there was an initi itive at one point in
 
00:45:57.359 --> 00:45:58.309 align:start position:0%
there was an initi itive at one point in
Circuit

00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
Circuit
 
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
Court called J1 that I'm not fully
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
familiar with um but J1 was going to be
 
00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
an electronic filing system and I know
 
00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:13.079 align:start position:0%
that we've got a couple departments in
 
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
Marram County that use J1 and
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
electronically file and it's been my
 
00:46:20.589 --> 00:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
experience that depending what court it
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
goes to there's different rules for J1
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
or different preferences for J1 and what
 
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
surprised me is at least one of the
 
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
courts we using you electronically file
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
through J1 but then you have to print a
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
copy of your electronic filing and
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
actually hand it to them because they're
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
still using you know everything in file
 
00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
folders and if it's not in a file folder
 
00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't exist in in their world
 
00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
so I know that the probate court right
 
00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
now which is a division of the the
 
00:46:58.470 --> 00:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
circuit court is was looking at doing
 
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
electronic filing and is I think has
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
sort of a pilot
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
project um but at this point traditional
 
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
you know misdemeanor violation criminal
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
court and in the future with the
 
00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
elimination of felonies first felonies
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
as well in in Circuit Court are going to
 
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
be filed the same way now that they were
 
00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
in 1982 on a on a written complaint and
 
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
to follow up on the on the felonies
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
going back we had a discussion with some
 
00:47:29.309 --> 00:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
of the folks from the administrative
 
00:47:31.549 --> 00:47:31.559 align:start position:0%
office of the courts recently uh and
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
several prosecutors and the question was
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
raised are the circuit courts going to
 
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
allow electronic filing and I I I think
 
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
I always wanted to ask the question
 
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
because marrat County um attorney's
 
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:45.400 align:start position:0%
office we cover five circuit courts in
 
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
three different counties propos the way
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
the judicial districts are are laid out
 
00:47:51.549 --> 00:47:51.559 align:start position:0%
um and we go all the way over to to
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
Newport um and to
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro for our courts so um it's
 
00:47:59.710 --> 00:47:59.720 align:start position:0%
conceivable that we have to have an
 
00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
attorney traveling long distances to get
 
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
to something that may be in an an early
 
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
am hearing uh which we we'll get the
 
00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
person there but when I ask hey can
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
things be filed
 
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
electronically the generic answer I got
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
well that's up to the local clerk yes
 
00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:16.599 align:start position:0%
this comes down to a continuity issue
 
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
that uh why can't something why can't
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
the C fors get something to
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
electronically file and um I don't know
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
the answer that well I guess I down of
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
dollars but and even but even absent
 
00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:32.200 align:start position:0%
dollars uh if there was a way to get it
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
to them even as a PDF attachment to an
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
email and then hard copy to follow when
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
the attorney gets there that allows them
 
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
to start the process docet things in get
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
things moving the only attorney gets
 
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
there they they give him the hard copy
 
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
but I don't think there's any yeah
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
standard and
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
that's I mean during coid a lot of the
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
courts had an email that you could you
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
could file through that email right and
 
00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:02.799 align:start position:0%
when coid wound down some of those
 
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
courts told us stop using those emails
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
and some courts were more receptive to
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
continuing to receive pleadings by email
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
but go going forward back to your
 
00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:16.839 align:start position:0%
question talking about electronic
 
00:49:16.839 --> 00:49:18.349 align:start position:0%
question talking about electronic
systems

00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
systems
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
um the the caution that I would have as
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
an outsider looking into the into the
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
system is uh be wary of developing new
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
single systems rather than integrating
 
00:49:31.789 --> 00:49:31.799 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
systems I think the former is uh we just
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
keep you uh in confusion the lat the
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
courts in confusion the latter will
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
integrate all our Courts for example a
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
bail Commission in Coos County who's
 
00:49:46.349 --> 00:49:46.359 align:start position:0%
going to um a small Police Department in
 
00:49:48.789 --> 00:49:48.799 align:start position:0%
Coos County should be able to to see the
 
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
prior nights bail form that was issued
 
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.670 align:start position:0%
prior nights bail form that was issued
in

00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:49:56.789 --> 00:49:56.799 align:start position:0%
Manchester like that but they can one of
 
00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
the problems that we've discovered is
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
that you can be arrested in Manchester
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
one night and three days later get
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
picked up in Portsmouth and they don't
 
00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
know you're on bail right they just so
 
00:50:09.309 --> 00:50:09.319 align:start position:0%
in their in the in the bail
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner's eyes it's first offense
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
and you're unless they we heard Tales of
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
police officers finding bail slips
 
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
crumpled up on the floor of the car
 
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
that's how they found out they were on
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
bail yeah so it it's it seems this
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
technology issue at least in the
 
00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
instance of bail regardless of the rest
 
00:50:29.069 --> 00:50:29.079 align:start position:0%
of it needs to be fixed ASAP because to
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
blame bail Commissioners for people
 
00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
being released multiple times when they
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
don't know yeah right right or police
 
00:50:36.589 --> 00:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
not knowing the conditions of bail set
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
in another County so that they can
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
enforce those conditions and pick
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
someone up seems to be a a definite
 
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
Public Safety um lapse at this point and
 
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
especially as would relate for pending
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
DV work yeah exactly but as my
 
00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
understanding DB orders are
 
00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
right yeah
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
follow well absolutely
 
00:51:02.349 --> 00:51:02.359 align:start position:0%
so I I think what we've been hearing is
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
that the the current processes that are
 
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
used in the court system in New
 
00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um they're not
 
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
consistent so not only can processes
 
00:51:15.789 --> 00:51:15.799 align:start position:0%
differ between the circuit court and the
 
00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
superior court but they can even vary
 
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
within individual cour houses M yes um
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
to a large extent um it sounds SS like a
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
lot of uh process gets moved by people
 
00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.190 align:start position:0%
lot of uh process gets moved by people
in

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
shoes um and one of my one of my
 
00:51:36.109 --> 00:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
questions is
 
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
um just because the process isn't
 
00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
electronic doesn't necessarily mean it's
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
not reliable right um and so
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
um but what it sounds like is
 
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
because so much in the Jud Judicial
 
00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:56.559 align:start position:0%
System um happens with paper and paper
 
00:51:59.789 --> 00:51:59.799 align:start position:0%
transfers between people what it does is
 
00:51:59.799 --> 00:52:00.630 align:start position:0%
transfers between people what it does is
it

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
creates what I think what you folks were
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
calling calling these gaps where you
 
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
have one group of people that has the
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
whole story or at least a pretty good
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
chunk of the story um and then a whole
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
other group of people who could really
 
00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
use that information who basically have
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
no access to that information until
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
somehow that P piece of paper migrates
 
00:52:29.069 --> 00:52:29.079 align:start position:0%
its way to the right person and
 
00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes even after that it can take
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
weeks or months for anything to happen
 
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
with it depending on where it gets
 
00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:39.799 align:start position:0%
prioritized in the court system is that
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
that a fair
 
00:52:44.549 --> 00:52:44.559 align:start position:0%
summary General generic Su I think so
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
yeah no I okay I think that's true
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
and I've certainly found myself in the
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
position of preparing for bail hearings
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
and if I have more time preparing for a
 
00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:01.880 align:start position:0%
bail hearing I've certainly done I've
 
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
called other jurisdictions to say hey do
 
00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
you know this guy do you know what's
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
going on and I'm always amazed at the
 
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:11.720 align:start position:0%
amount of information I get when I
 
00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
actually have the time to do that or get
 
00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
someone on the phone who knows what's
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
going on because it gives you a much
 
00:53:23.069 --> 00:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
Fuller picture of of what's going on in
 
00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
in your case and you know know and the
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
information can work both both ways if
 
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
I'm doing a bail hearing and I have an
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
individual who has seven different open
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
cases and I see that on his criminal
 
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
record um if I know he's appeared for
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
every court hearing that he's appeared
 
00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
that that was scheduled that's a good
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
thing you know and it changes the the
 
00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
calculus that I may have on what I'm
 
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
going to request for bail they they may
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
be minor offenses all of them may be
 
00:53:55.829 --> 00:53:55.839 align:start position:0%
minor offenses um uh he's uh he's not
 
00:53:58.270 --> 00:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
committing serious against the person
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
offenses there maybe minor property
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
offenses but he's appearing at every at
 
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
every hearing he's going to that's going
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
to have a different uh Cal calculus in
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
my in my bail recommendation as would
 
00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
the the opposite he has more serious
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
crimes that I don't know about because
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
they haven't made it to the to the uh
 
00:54:17.309 --> 00:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
criminal record yet uh they were only a
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
day or so prior I don't have the bail
 
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
information uh and knowing that would
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
change the characters and in the Bale
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
statute itself it says I think says that
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
the uh person reviewing bail uses all
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
relevant information and um certainly
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
all of that information is certainly
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:44.200 align:start position:0%
you if the committee's done may I say a
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
things thank you uh most of what I want
 
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
to say it's already been said but I'm
 
00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
determined to say it anyway so the um I
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
am a big fan of education and
 
00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
consistency because prosecutor Steve
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
just said opened with 35 days the sign
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
in the Manchester bail off bail
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
compartment broom cubicle says 45 days
 
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
okay U the other thing is we're if
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
there's a no show we're all fans of due
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
process you want to hear I mean we just
 
00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
we want to start slamming in those show
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
I had a guy
 
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
turned himself in who said yes I didn't
 
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
appear for court because I was in the
 
00:55:33.069 --> 00:55:33.079 align:start position:0%
Essex Massachusetts County House of
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
Correction well the guy turned himself
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
in yeah I he was a good bet for PR the
 
00:55:43.309 --> 00:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
last thing U people some of defendants
 
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
have a curious way of bragging I always
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
show up for my court dates that's
 
00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
something to be proud of you always show
 
00:55:50.589 --> 00:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
up for your court
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
dates by the way NCR fors they're
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
gone we've moved up to Xerox machines
 
00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
now we're really moving along um the uh
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
I have many many times seen
 
00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:08.839 align:start position:0%
nonappearance for court uh electronic
 
00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
benchs they're invariably I've never
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
seen a hold maybe that's because the
 
00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
police don't show them to me but it's
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
either a cash bail or
 
00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:21.400 align:start position:0%
PR and I've not ever seen again it's
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
that's my experience I don't know what's
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
going on but look I the the real residue
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
that I want to leave is training and
 
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
consistency that's the big thing in my
 
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
book thank you for
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
listening we did hear that um and I
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
think it again it goes back to counties
 
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not the judges in those
 
00:56:43.069 --> 00:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
particular cour houses say no bail or
 
00:56:45.029 --> 00:56:45.039 align:start position:0%
they leave them as PR or some nominal
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
cash amount um but the we do as a
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
committee I believe have heard and we
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
observed because we went on a field trip
 
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
the green of the year to conquer
 
00:56:57.309 --> 00:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
District Court and saw the list be
 
00:56:59.069 --> 00:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
called off of people who were not there
 
00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
default default default um so we
 
00:57:04.589 --> 00:57:04.599 align:start position:0%
understand that that is a problem right
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
um it backs up the system it causes log
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
jams in the system and um it's
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
definitely something we need to look at
 
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
and training training is a huge thing I
 
00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
know that there's all there's always
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
Nuance in in statutes and every once in
 
00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
a while um I think the lack of training
 
00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:23.720 align:start position:0%
shows its head when there's a
 
00:57:26.829 --> 00:57:26.839 align:start position:0%
possibility of a life sentence in a in a
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
um in a charge and a person's released
 
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
on PR bail when the statute says that
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
they should be detained that happens
 
00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
every once in a while and I I think that
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
circles around to the training and
 
00:57:40.829 --> 00:57:40.839 align:start position:0%
experience level that we've talked about
 
00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
I would have hoped in that case the
 
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
police would have jumped up and down and
 
00:57:46.349 --> 00:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
pointed the statue um representative
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
Murray has a question certainly I'm just
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
trying to pull out like you know because
 
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
we've talked about a variety of
 
00:57:53.549 --> 00:57:53.559 align:start position:0%
different problems in the system so like
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
what are you know the big pieces
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
and um you know we don't have access to
 
00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:01.839 align:start position:0%
this data I don't know if you do but are
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
you seeing the issues being like
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
erroneously given PR bail like being a
 
00:58:10.829 --> 00:58:10.839 align:start position:0%
huge cause of the issues here or is it
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
like non appearance like what are the
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
like the big glaring issues with the
 
00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
bail system I guess right now in terms
 
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
of like is the pr bail being given too
 
00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
often you know when you're talking about
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners like maybe we just
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
don't let them rule on certain cases
 
00:58:30.029 --> 00:58:30.039 align:start position:0%
like what is what is your what are your
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that I guess that's a tough
 
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
question to answer because there too
 
00:58:37.029 --> 00:58:37.039 align:start position:0%
many moving Parts in each and every bail
 
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
decision um I think as a matter of
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
public policy though the there needs to
 
00:58:45.789 --> 00:58:45.799 align:start position:0%
be some line drawn that establishes the
 
00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:47.720 align:start position:0%
public policy where someone is
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
committing enough crimes there there
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
there's a default maybe a rebuttable
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
presumption that there are a danger to
 
00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
the community and need to go in front of
 
00:58:57.029 --> 00:58:57.039 align:start position:0%
a judge versus a bail commissioner or
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
that a crime that they commit um that's
 
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
charged is so egregious that you cannot
 
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
see a bail commission you must see a a
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
judge the next morning um and clearly
 
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
those are public policy uh choices um I
 
00:59:15.789 --> 00:59:15.799 align:start position:0%
can tell you that that it seems to me
 
00:59:20.349 --> 00:59:20.359 align:start position:0%
over the last three to four years that
 
00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
defendants uh no longer respect the cour
 
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
they no longer they no longer respect
 
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
the court orders uh and I think that
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
comes uh from a perception of nothing's
 
00:59:34.029 --> 00:59:34.039 align:start position:0%
going to be done I'm not going to be
 
00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839 align:start position:0%
held why should I not appear or why
 
00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:37.720 align:start position:0%
should I appear I think that circles
 
00:59:38.829 --> 00:59:38.839 align:start position:0%
back with what I mentioned about the
 
00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
multiple non- appearances and multiple
 
00:59:43.029 --> 00:59:43.039 align:start position:0%
new crimes that are being committed uh
 
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
and certainly certainly is a small
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
population that uh that is repeat
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
offenders we're not talking about the
 
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
majority of
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
people yeah I believe the current
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
statute has a trigger if it's three
 
00:59:59.390 --> 00:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
times or five times within certain
 
01:00:01.069 --> 01:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
number of years and I think we maybe
 
01:00:02.829 --> 01:00:02.839 align:start position:0%
need to look at lowering the thresholds
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
on those but it does contain them
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
currently in the statute I believe but
 
01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
that just creates a presumption that
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
you're a risk of flight and then the
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
statute says you can't set cash bail
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
that the person can't make yeah so it's
 
01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
kind of it defeats its own purpose of
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
the that's the difficulty is you have
 
01:00:22.109 --> 01:00:22.119 align:start position:0%
someone who comes in and says yeah I
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
failed to appear four times and don't
 
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
have a dollar to my
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
name yeah that can be interpreted to
 
01:00:31.589 --> 01:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
mean they can only be given
 
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
PR I have like kind of a two-part I
 
01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
guess so is it fair to say the majority
 
01:00:38.190 --> 01:00:38.200 align:start position:0%
of the pr bails are not the problem it's
 
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
just like a select group within this
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
like the majority are fine yeah I mean I
 
01:00:47.789 --> 01:00:47.799 align:start position:0%
think the majority of people get PR bail
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
and and probably deserve and should
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
right um the concern is that some people
 
01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
get PR bail
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
and continue to commit crimes which is a
 
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
concern and then you have people that
 
01:01:04.029 --> 01:01:04.039 align:start position:0%
get PR bail and and don't come to court
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
and I think that the don't come to court
 
01:01:09.029 --> 01:01:09.039 align:start position:0%
group can sort of be further broken down
 
01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
into there are people who are
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
purposely you know dodging court and
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
then there's a group of people who just
 
01:01:19.829 --> 01:01:19.839 align:start position:0%
couldn't get to an appointment if their
 
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
life depended on it because that's not
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
within their ability level yeah and
 
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
trying to figure
 
01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
out where everybody fits in that and
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
what the appropriate remedy is because
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
it's obviously a different remedy for
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
everybody it's not a one-sized fits-all
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
solution yeah I think hearing about the
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
pre-trial Services you guys offer and um
 
01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:45.799 align:start position:0%
also what you mentioned New York doing
 
01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:47.960 align:start position:0%
with the notification like that feels
 
01:01:50.589 --> 01:01:50.599 align:start position:0%
like both things that we should you know
 
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
Explore More and expand on because it
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
just feels hard to like take you know
 
01:01:56.269 --> 01:01:56.279 align:start position:0%
when you have houseless people that get
 
01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
arrested for trespassing for sleeping in
 
01:01:59.710 --> 01:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
a public park you know over and over
 
01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
like what other option do they have
 
01:02:03.069 --> 01:02:03.079 align:start position:0%
available to them like can we really
 
01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
just hold them indefinitely I I always
 
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
think back I had a case years and years
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
ago where I had a young woman who was
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
arrested charged she didn't come to
 
01:02:16.349 --> 01:02:16.359 align:start position:0%
court but she worked at one of the
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
convenience stores in town and she
 
01:02:20.829 --> 01:02:20.839 align:start position:0%
worked the overnight shift and all the
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
police knew like she was there from
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
Midnight night to 88: a.m. every single
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
night never missed a day at work but
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
like never came to her court dates and
 
01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:34.039 align:start position:0%
it's not that
 
01:02:37.309 --> 01:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
she's necessarily you know on the lamb
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
or fleeing law it's just that she didn't
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
want to deal with court she didn't go to
 
01:02:41.599 --> 01:02:43.309 align:start position:0%
want to deal with court she didn't go to
court

01:02:43.309 --> 01:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
um but it's not like we didn't know
 
01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:49.160 align:start position:0%
where she was you know interestingly the
 
01:02:51.269 --> 01:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
police would go and say to her you have
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
a warrant you're under arrest and she's
 
01:02:54.589 --> 01:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
like I can't leave I'm the only one one
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
here they're like turn yourself in
 
01:02:59.390 --> 01:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning at 8:
 
01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
a.m. so and the local police in my
 
01:03:05.269 --> 01:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
experience at least in marrat County are
 
01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
pretty good about about approaching
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
folks that are not appearances and and
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
in a in in an appropriate manner based
 
01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
on the circumstances that's my
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
experience and I believe that may
 
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
trigger some liability for the police
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
officers that once they go up to them
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
and say I know you have a warrant but
 
01:03:24.789 --> 01:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to take you
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
he kills somebody later on you're you're
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
in it yeah I
 
01:03:31.269 --> 01:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
mean I don't think there was any concern
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
that she was going to kill anybody no
 
01:03:36.269 --> 01:03:36.279 align:start position:0%
not in that case but yeah no absolutely
 
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
yeah especially where you have issues
 
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
with mental health um yeah you just
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
never know and that's why I was curious
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
as to what services were available
 
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me circling back to
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
the beginning of this
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
um I didn't hear a lot about you know
 
01:03:56.029 --> 01:03:56.039 align:start position:0%
the the the violence being let out I
 
01:03:58.750 --> 01:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
hear more about the repeat def
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
defaults nuisance crimes and what do we
 
01:04:04.029 --> 01:04:04.039 align:start position:0%
do with them mean that's a public policy
 
01:04:06.349 --> 01:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
question not necessarily going to be
 
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
answered by bail because bail deals with
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
flight and and safety so we need to
 
01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
figure out how to Loop those together so
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
that when someone does become Justice
 
01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
involved they also become service
 
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
involved and I think that will cut down
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
on the former any U representative go
 
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chairman um so I just
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to get clarity on something and
 
01:04:30.269 --> 01:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
then I also have a followup uh you said
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
everything in circuit court is done by
 
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
paper so does that mean that and
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
everything uh in Superior Court has
 
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
electronic filing and also Supreme Court
 
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
but does that mean that throughout the
 
01:04:44.349 --> 01:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
whole court system for Superior Supreme
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
and circuit that all the bail or the
 
01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
notifications for court dates are given
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
with paper does is there any electronic
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh uh notification of a of a court date
 
01:04:59.829 --> 01:04:59.839 align:start position:0%
given to people so
 
01:05:04.029 --> 01:05:04.039 align:start position:0%
in Circuit Court the the hearing notice
 
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
is I and this is again my experience and
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
belief and I can be I could be wrong
 
01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
about this but in ciruit court it's
 
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
mailed to you so if it's mailed to your
 
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
last known address um and if you have an
 
01:05:18.269 --> 01:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
attorney obviously it's mailed to the
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
attorney in Superior Court those
 
01:05:24.269 --> 01:05:24.279 align:start position:0%
notifications are sent electronically
 
01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:25.799 align:start position:0%
again in Superior Court we're usually
 
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with felony level offenses so it
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
would be emailed to the
 
01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
attorneys um and not necessarily
 
01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:34.559 align:start position:0%
directly to the
 
01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:37.240 align:start position:0%
defendant and I know for many years in
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
conquer in the six Circuit Court
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
conquered uh in the criminal arraignment
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
sessions they would give the individual
 
01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
a paper copy right in the courtroom when
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
they entered their ple of not guilty
 
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
they would issue them their paper copy
 
01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
right in the right in the court
 
01:05:56.829 --> 01:05:56.839 align:start position:0%
just because we generally didn't have
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
good addresses or it was hard to follow
 
01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
up yes um and then my second question
 
01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
is overall for the baale system
 
01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
including people not showing up the no
 
01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
shows how much is this a problem of a
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
decay in society where people cost of
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
living is going up more homeless
 
01:06:19.549 --> 01:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
individuals more crime as a result
 
01:06:22.269 --> 01:06:22.279 align:start position:0%
people just not like you said their
 
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
life's a mess uh they can't they just
 
01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
can't they have no respect for
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
institutions anymore how much of it how
 
01:06:32.109 --> 01:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
much of the problem is that and not
 
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily a structural statuto uh
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
issue that'd be hard for to say there's
 
01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
cause and effect because I've just not
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
I've just not looked at it to be honest
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
with you yeah I I know
 
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
anecdotally there's a there's a
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
perception among some of the police
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
departments that in a larger
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions that some of the uh some
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
of the increased thefts are due to uh
 
01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
due to drug issues um thefts selling
 
01:07:04.829 --> 01:07:04.839 align:start position:0%
drugs to buy there's a there's a
 
01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
anecdotal about that but I don't know if
 
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
there's any if there's any direct
 
01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
connection but on a on
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
a just a how society's running basis I
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
I'd be hard foress to give you an answer
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
on that yeah and I think that's hard to
 
01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:21.640 align:start position:0%
to quantify I think you know we can all
 
01:07:24.029 --> 01:07:24.039 align:start position:0%
say that there are things that you know
 
01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
people might have do or say today that
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
would have been Unthinkable to do or say
 
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
20 years ago
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't know I certainly think
 
01:07:38.829 --> 01:07:38.839 align:start position:0%
that there is
 
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839 align:start position:0%
a a
 
01:07:45.390 --> 01:07:45.400 align:start position:0%
societal level of respect for the court
 
01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
system that may be
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
declining how much of that is
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
self-inflicted is is really yeah I I
 
01:07:55.390 --> 01:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
mean I don't and just so happens that
 
01:07:57.789 --> 01:07:57.799 align:start position:0%
the that the decline in that respect is
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
with the same group
 
01:08:03.309 --> 01:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
that the one right right it's a and to
 
01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
be to be quite honest about it it's a
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
very small part of the population having
 
01:08:10.589 --> 01:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
a very large impact on society which is
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
why we want to figure out how to address
 
01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
these these small these small offenses
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
that are cumulative and they're like a
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
constant dripping on society and
 
01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
draining resources and their their um I
 
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
believe the cities of Manchester and
 
01:08:27.789 --> 01:08:27.799 align:start position:0%
nashille are suffering you know more
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
than most and that's why we see people
 
01:08:32.349 --> 01:08:32.359 align:start position:0%
coming forward bringing these bills who
 
01:08:34.349 --> 01:08:34.359 align:start position:0%
you traditionally wouldn't saying we we
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
need help something's happening and I
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily agree that it's the
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
idea of personal cognizance that's
 
01:08:42.749 --> 01:08:42.759 align:start position:0%
causing it I I I firmly believe that
 
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
cash for the most part is a u is an
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
Antiquated Old English system of law um
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
that really doesn't apply as much
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
nowadays unless you already are somebody
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
means where losing that money would hurt
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
you if you don't have it in the first
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
place the design is to make you show
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
back up for core to get your money back
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
if you have no money setting bail on
 
01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:05.960 align:start position:0%
someone that they can't afford really is
 
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
just saying I'm holding it so let's just
 
01:09:09.870 --> 01:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
say we're holding it so I I think we
 
01:09:12.829 --> 01:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
have to figure out the that line there I
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
can I can tell you I that that I
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate what your committee is doing
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
take a big picture approach to it rather
 
01:09:22.829 --> 01:09:22.839 align:start position:0%
than uh uh than a PEC meal approach I
 
01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
think that's important I think it's very
 
01:09:27.149 --> 01:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
important we may have bitten off more
 
01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
than we can
 
01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
chew I think it's at the point now where
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask the the governor um if
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
he might not in in in Persona the pope
 
01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
and we call a criminal justice Summit or
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
Council of something because it seems
 
01:09:43.149 --> 01:09:43.159 align:start position:0%
like every agency or piece of the
 
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice System we talk to says
 
01:09:47.470 --> 01:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
it's broken but they pointed a different
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
part and I think everybody needs to get
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
together and it's not going to be fixed
 
01:09:53.309 --> 01:09:53.319 align:start position:0%
what I think has happened the system has
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
developed in an in an ad hoc way and I
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
think it's coming to a point where where
 
01:10:03.229 --> 01:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
now the state needs to focus how
 
01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
everything is going to make it a
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
consistent way throughout the entire
 
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
State um with your permission I'll ask
 
01:10:11.709 --> 01:10:11.719 align:start position:0%
our Human Services folks to send you
 
01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:14.679 align:start position:0%
information about the uh programs that
 
01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
they um have within maram County um you
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
seem to the Committee Member seem to uh
 
01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
have an interest in it I'll send you the
 
01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
information on the bail commissioner
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
issue uh and uh if it's all right with
 
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
you chairman I have a copy of a letter
 
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
that I sent to Senator Carson and and
 
01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
her standing committee on the Judiciary
 
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
back on bail on bail back in February
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
this year I'll give that to individuals
 
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
and I have additional copies for the
 
01:10:42.189 --> 01:10:42.199 align:start position:0%
members who aren't here and when you
 
01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
speak to the person about the pre-trial
 
01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
Services thing if they could just give
 
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
us rough numbers of what what the cost
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
is for your county so we could maybe
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
possibly begin to extrapolate out on a
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
state level what that type of system
 
01:10:55.709 --> 01:10:55.719 align:start position:0%
she's very proud of that program she's
 
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
worked extremely hard putting it
 
01:10:58.750 --> 01:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
together over the last two years it's
 
01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
working it's working very very well
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
sounds like she should be proud thank
 
01:11:05.229 --> 01:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
you very much any further go ahead Just
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
One Last specific question that I had to
 
01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.350 align:start position:0%
One Last specific question that I had to
ask

01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
ask
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
um how much would and again you know
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
dollars dollars dollars of course but
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
putting that aside for a second how much
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
in your opinion would Transportation or
 
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
some means of transportation help with a
 
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
no-show uh problem making sure that
 
01:11:24.430 --> 01:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
people who don't have a car or living on
 
01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
the street could be driven to the court
 
01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
in some way and again bringing up
 
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
the we have different populations and
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
you've got in terms of no- shows you
 
01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
have people who are purposely ducking
 
01:11:40.990 --> 01:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice system providing
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
them with Transportation isn't going to
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
get them there because they're going to
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
duck the transportation and then you
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
have a population that you know just
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the means to get there or
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't get there and I think that
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
would certainly certainly help a segment
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
of that population get there I believe
 
01:11:59.790 --> 01:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
we already offered transportation that
 
01:12:01.390 --> 01:12:01.400 align:start position:0%
comes with bracelets
 
01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
I um and and like looking at I was
 
01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
saying yesterday we had you know eight
 
01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
failures to appear out of nine people I
 
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
can't tell you
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
if all eight of those people that failed
 
01:12:19.390 --> 01:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
to appear are facing homelessness or
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
don't have cars or have other you know
 
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
massive life events that prevented them
 
01:12:26.669 --> 01:12:26.679 align:start position:0%
from being there or what percentage of
 
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
those eight are fleeing Justice and not
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
coming to court but my guess would be
 
01:12:37.629 --> 01:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
that more than 50% it's a resource issue
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
that if they were provided a ride or
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
maybe even a reminder they might show up
 
01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
and that's that's a that's a tough
 
01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
question because in New Hampshire you
 
01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
have very rural areas um but along those
 
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
same lines I know that the
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
Human Services folks as part of their
 
01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
projects has been working to expand um
 
01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
available uh Transportation Systems
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire County I I think
 
01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
they're working on even up uh into the
 
01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
northern part of the county coming down
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
at the conquer so I'll make sure when I
 
01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
ask them to send information to the
 
01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
committee that that that they include uh
 
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
include what they're trying to do for
 
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
for transportation because the
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
transportation is also key in in the
 
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
Human Services side of things to get the
 
01:13:24.430 --> 01:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
mental health uh service to get the drug
 
01:13:26.830 --> 01:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
treatment services to get the uh the
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
medical services that that that people
 
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
need so I think it's all it's all
 
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
interrelated curiously the the text idea
 
01:13:38.629 --> 01:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
how it lowered the appearances I believe
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
now that there Federal programs work
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
anyone can have a cell phone I I'd be
 
01:13:44.709 --> 01:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
curious to know how many even of the
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
unhoused people have cell phones because
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
you can get it I think yeah the vast
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
majority of people we interact with have
 
01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
cell phones so a text reminder you know
 
01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
the night before and the morning of
 
01:13:59.229 --> 01:13:59.239 align:start position:0%
saying to your court and and then maybe
 
01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
one more that says you're now in warrant
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
could generate even if it cuts a
 
01:14:07.149 --> 01:14:07.159 align:start position:0%
percentage um of the no- shows they
 
01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
would save thank you for that any
 
01:14:11.629 --> 01:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
further questions have a comment
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
actually y um The Rock Rockefeller
 
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
Center at Dartmouth um did a study and
 
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
it came out that um one the main issue
 
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
was Child Care responsibility yeah and
 
01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
then Transportation then Employment and
 
01:14:26.639 --> 01:14:27.550 align:start position:0%
then Transportation then Employment and
then

01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:14:30.629 --> 01:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
forgot and intentional skips was the
 
01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
last so it seems like um we do have a
 
01:14:37.149 --> 01:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
problem and the text alerts might help
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
um their study showed that it does
 
01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
definitely does
 
01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
help yeah no that that doesn't surprise
 
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
me not at all thank you thank you and uh
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
we would appreciate any further
 
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
information as you said Thank you thank
 
01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
you at this point we're going to take a
 
01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
10-minute bi break and then come back
 
01:14:58.270 --> 01:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
and at that point I think I'd like to
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.199 --> 01:26:51.189 align:start position:0%
 
Chiefs

01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.199 --> 01:39:03.470 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:06.030 --> 01:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
and we are back on the record um at this
 
01:39:07.589 --> 01:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
point I believe there's one more County
 
01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:21.550 --> 01:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
testify if you could just tell us who
 
01:39:23.310 --> 01:39:23.320 align:start position:0%
you are and where you are from and I
 
01:39:25.229 --> 01:39:25.239 align:start position:0%
won't repeat everything we started with
 
01:39:44.830 --> 01:39:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
heard thank you I'm I'm here for two
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
reasons maybe just to make a couple
 
01:39:50.719 --> 01:39:52.030 align:start position:0%
reasons maybe just to make a couple
comments

01:39:52.030 --> 01:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
and to be available uh for your
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
questions and I'm I'm happy to begin
 
01:39:59.870 --> 01:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
with one or the other depending on what
 
01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:02.750 align:start position:0%
with one or the other depending on what
the

01:40:02.750 --> 01:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.750 align:start position:0%
 
chair

01:40:04.750 --> 01:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
um first of all I I hearkened back to
 
01:40:11.310 --> 01:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
the last time we were here on bail
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
reform in
 
01:40:16.750 --> 01:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
2018 and there was a tremendous dialogue
 
01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:17.750 align:start position:0%
2018 and there was a tremendous dialogue
in

01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:40:20.589 --> 01:40:20.599 align:start position:0%
2018 regarding what the standard should
 
01:40:20.599 --> 01:40:21.750 align:start position:0%
2018 regarding what the standard should
be

01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and the argument was
 
01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
essentially that there was a clear and
 
01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence standard that was
 
01:40:33.950 --> 01:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
mandated by
 
01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
fergal um I I don't know it how clear it
 
01:40:41.709 --> 01:40:41.719 align:start position:0%
has become since then but the Supreme
 
01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
Court has said that that is not the
 
01:40:47.709 --> 01:40:47.719 align:start position:0%
standard that we're required to use um
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
and that's in zuhowski the case that we
 
01:40:51.589 --> 01:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
just recently
 
01:40:51.599 --> 01:40:52.430 align:start position:0%
just recently
had

01:40:52.430 --> 01:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
referenced and that was that was part of
 
01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
the argument as to what standard we
 
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
should use in
 
01:41:03.270 --> 01:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
evaluating um detention
 
01:41:09.149 --> 01:41:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
I and the the the the zuhowski case said
 
01:41:16.669 --> 01:41:16.679 align:start position:0%
in fergal we rejected the argument that
 
01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
solaro sent a minimum standard for all
 
01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:21.870 align:start position:0%
solaro sent a minimum standard for all
bail

01:41:21.870 --> 01:41:21.880 align:start position:0%
bail
 
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
inquiries and then it goes on to say
 
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
that the clear and convincing evidence
 
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
standard is not required
 
01:41:33.470 --> 01:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
constitutionally in New Hampshire and
 
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
was that the um the majority opinion
 
01:41:38.990 --> 01:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
you're reading from um yes I I would NE
 
01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
I would never R you a minority opinion
 
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
um and in fact that was information that
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
I I cited to the court recently in in a
 
01:41:51.629 --> 01:41:51.639 align:start position:0%
bail argument that we had over
 
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
a challenge to the
 
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of one of the
 
01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
provisions of the baale statute not of
 
01:42:00.910 --> 01:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
the bail statute itself but of the bail
 
01:42:04.149 --> 01:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
law that allows for mandatory detention
 
01:42:05.229 --> 01:42:05.239 align:start position:0%
on life
 
01:42:08.709 --> 01:42:08.719 align:start position:0%
sentences so um I'm very
 
01:42:12.189 --> 01:42:12.199 align:start position:0%
confident that we are no longer required
 
01:42:14.990 --> 01:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
to use that
 
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.669 align:start position:0%
to use that
standard

01:42:16.669 --> 01:42:16.679 align:start position:0%
standard
 
01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
um second thing I would like to say is I
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
think the first question we have to ask
 
01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
when we're sitting here discussing bail
 
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
is what are we as a society willing to
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
tolerate and and what I mean by that is
 
01:42:37.070 --> 01:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of
 
01:42:40.109 --> 01:42:40.119 align:start position:0%
conversations about crimes committed out
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
on bail we've had a lot of conversations
 
01:42:45.550 --> 01:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
about failures to
 
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
appear both of those things are huge
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
problems and both of those things are
 
01:42:55.589 --> 01:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
are something that I think we should ask
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
the question how much of this and under
 
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
what circumstances are we willing to
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
tolerate it in other words is there ever
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
an end to how many times you can not
 
01:43:10.870 --> 01:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
appear before there's going to be a
 
01:43:13.070 --> 01:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
presumption of
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
detention under what
 
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances are we going to say that
 
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
crimes committed out on bail have risen
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
to the level that we are no longer going
 
01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
to allow that person to be accessing
 
01:43:29.470 --> 01:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
bail and I think those are fundamental
 
01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:32.639 align:start position:0%
questions that we have to ask as a
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
society and I think if we don't ask them
 
01:43:37.830 --> 01:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
we end
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
up talking tremendous amount about the
 
01:43:46.189 --> 01:43:46.199 align:start position:0%
why the why is important but at some
 
01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
juncture it cannot be
 
01:43:51.990 --> 01:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
dispositive in other words
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
we have Society has an obligation not
 
01:43:57.629 --> 01:43:57.639 align:start position:0%
only to look at the offender and the
 
01:43:59.870 --> 01:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
impact that the criminal justice systems
 
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
interaction with the offender has on him
 
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
or her but Society also has an
 
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
obligation to ask what is the impact on
 
01:44:11.310 --> 01:44:11.320 align:start position:0%
Society on allowing this Behavior to
 
01:44:14.950 --> 01:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
continue unchecked and be unwilling to
 
01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:15.950 align:start position:0%
continue unchecked and be unwilling to
check

01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
check
 
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
it and I think that in many respects the
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
frustration that we hear about bail
 
01:44:26.189 --> 01:44:26.199 align:start position:0%
reform is is about an
 
01:44:29.589 --> 01:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
unwillingness for society as evidence by
 
01:44:33.310 --> 01:44:33.320 align:start position:0%
the bail statute and perhaps more
 
01:44:34.910 --> 01:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
pointedly by its
 
01:44:37.189 --> 01:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
application that we are unwilling to
 
01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
protect society as a whole so I think
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's a fundamental question that we
 
01:44:43.030 --> 01:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:44:45.390 --> 01:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
ask and then I think it's important that
 
01:44:47.070 --> 01:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
I just convey a little bit about where I
 
01:44:49.870 --> 01:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
come come from on Bale I have no
 
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
interest in cash B
 
01:44:54.589 --> 01:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
ever I think people we should be making
 
01:44:57.669 --> 01:44:57.679 align:start position:0%
an in or out determination and if we
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
make an out determination early on in
 
01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
the process and nothing changes that's
 
01:45:06.589 --> 01:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
perfect but if there is if we struggle
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
mightily as a society to bring that
 
01:45:11.189 --> 01:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
person before the court or if we
 
01:45:14.589 --> 01:45:14.599 align:start position:0%
struggle mightily as a society to with
 
01:45:16.830 --> 01:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
that individual committing new crimes we
 
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:45:20.709 --> 01:45:20.719 align:start position:0%
reassess the situation and make a deter
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
ation that we are no longer willing to
 
01:45:27.589 --> 01:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
accept this level either in volume or in
 
01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
seriousness criminal conduct in volume
 
01:45:34.990 --> 01:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
or seriousness of failure to appear and
 
01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
all failure to appears are not created
 
01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
equal for example if you failure to
 
01:45:41.390 --> 01:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
appear the day of your
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
trial that's a biggie and but there's
 
01:45:48.030 --> 01:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
got to be an there's got to be a
 
01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
conversation at the legislative level
 
01:45:53.550 --> 01:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
about what those lines are what are we
 
01:45:56.109 --> 01:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
willing as a society to
 
01:45:58.870 --> 01:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
tolerate and I don't think that question
 
01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
um and just another quick observation is
 
01:46:13.390 --> 01:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
I've heard numerous times last time I
 
01:46:17.790 --> 01:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
was here um in 2018 and I've heard the
 
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
question again what about data
 
01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we could do to to
 
01:46:28.510 --> 01:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
generate data is to have the bail form
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
that we use in
 
01:46:34.270 --> 01:46:34.280 align:start position:0%
court track the decision-making process
 
01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
that's in the bail
 
01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:37.910 align:start position:0%
that's in the bail
statute

01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
and that could be managed by the
 
01:46:42.589 --> 01:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
administrative office of the courts and
 
01:46:44.189 --> 01:46:44.199 align:start position:0%
maybe there could be a computer computer
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
program and we could figure out how many
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
Nosh shows how how many crimes committed
 
01:46:52.750 --> 01:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
out on bail we don't have that data we
 
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
don't have the time or the energy to do
 
01:46:56.629 --> 01:46:56.639 align:start position:0%
the data entry in our office it's a
 
01:46:58.950 --> 01:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
small office but that data would be
 
01:47:01.550 --> 01:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
valuable to you it would be valuable to
 
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
any decision making decision maker in
 
01:47:08.229 --> 01:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
this Arena and I think having that bail
 
01:47:12.109 --> 01:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
form track the statute decision making
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
process would be very helpful I don't
 
01:47:18.270 --> 01:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
know how many of you have looked at the
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
current bail form that we use it's
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
really about a page in a fraction and
 
01:47:25.870 --> 01:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
then a big space for the judge to sign
 
01:47:28.270 --> 01:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't really track the
 
01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:29.990 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't really track the
decisionmaking

01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking
 
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.510 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking
process

01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
and I think that that would be helpful
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
to everybody involved if we knew from
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
looking at the bail form that somebody
 
01:47:42.910 --> 01:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
was charged with an offense while out on
 
01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:45.719 align:start position:0%
bail if we knew that there were fire
 
01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
prior failures to appear and that those
 
01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
initial presumptions had been triggered
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
what we have is we have a one bucket
 
01:47:56.430 --> 01:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
line item that says
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
essentially we we've decided that you're
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
released into the community having
 
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
evaluated this under the clear and
 
01:48:07.109 --> 01:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence standard okay so
 
01:48:09.310 --> 01:48:09.320 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm coming from
 
01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
fundamentally is I think the biggest
 
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
thing that we need to do is decide what
 
01:48:14.189 --> 01:48:14.199 align:start position:0%
we will not
 
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
tolerate and I'm happy to answer any
 
01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:17.830 align:start position:0%
tolerate and I'm happy to answer any
other

01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you in your
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
in in the courts that you practice
 
01:48:26.669 --> 01:48:26.679 align:start position:0%
in the you heard the question I asked
 
01:48:28.589 --> 01:48:28.599 align:start position:0%
initially of the other County attorneys
 
01:48:30.990 --> 01:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
with regard to what are the types of
 
01:48:33.470 --> 01:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
crimes that are really triggering this
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
this problem of these repeat out on
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
baales and are you of the same opinion
 
01:48:40.270 --> 01:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
that it's these these nuisance level
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
crimes these misdemeanors such as uh
 
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
trespass um shoplifting these type of
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
things that are occurring on the repeat
 
01:48:50.510 --> 01:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
while you're on bail no I I think think
 
01:48:53.709 --> 01:48:53.719 align:start position:0%
I I are you let me just make sure I
 
01:48:54.589 --> 01:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
understand the question is the question
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
is what is the crime being committed out
 
01:48:59.430 --> 01:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
on Bale yeah what what types of crimes
 
01:49:01.470 --> 01:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
because we have a list of 13 crimes the
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
Senate proposed and they're all very
 
01:49:05.589 --> 01:49:05.599 align:start position:0%
serious crimes with violence against the
 
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
person but what we've heard anecdotally
 
01:49:10.669 --> 01:49:10.679 align:start position:0%
is that's not what the people are being
 
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
picked up on time and time again while
 
01:49:14.270 --> 01:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
they're out on bail it's lower level
 
01:49:15.629 --> 01:49:15.639 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor crime some of which don't
 
01:49:17.709 --> 01:49:17.719 align:start position:0%
even carry a jail sentence where they
 
01:49:17.719 --> 01:49:18.790 align:start position:0%
even carry a jail sentence where they
found

01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
found
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
guilty first so I think I think that
 
01:49:22.510 --> 01:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
that's an
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
oversimplification um we see a broad
 
01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:27.679 align:start position:0%
range of criminal Behavior I think
 
01:49:31.550 --> 01:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between a uh a
 
01:49:34.270 --> 01:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor shoplifting First Defense
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
you know committed on release and
 
01:49:39.629 --> 01:49:39.639 align:start position:0%
somebody who commits a violation of a
 
01:49:42.149 --> 01:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
protective order it's a misdemeanor I
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
think we have to be able to rationally
 
01:49:47.149 --> 01:49:47.159 align:start position:0%
distinguish between those two things and
 
01:49:51.149 --> 01:49:51.159 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't suggest that you know one one
 
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
new crime committed out on release
 
01:49:57.709 --> 01:49:57.719 align:start position:0%
should automatically result in detention
 
01:49:59.669 --> 01:49:59.679 align:start position:0%
but I think we should be able to
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
quantify those crimes or identify those
 
01:50:04.589 --> 01:50:04.599 align:start position:0%
crimes that we certainly should make
 
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
that leap in other words if you're out
 
01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
on bail and you commit one of these
 
01:50:10.750 --> 01:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
crimes there will be a strong
 
01:50:13.629 --> 01:50:13.639 align:start position:0%
presumption or mandatory detention
 
01:50:16.390 --> 01:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
pending trial I I think that that's what
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
Society has to be able to expect a
 
01:50:24.030 --> 01:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system that will act to
 
01:50:28.390 --> 01:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
protect the interest of the
 
01:50:32.589 --> 01:50:32.599 align:start position:0%
accused the the victim and the defendant
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
and right now um for whatever
 
01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
reason you can have people out on
 
01:50:41.709 --> 01:50:41.719 align:start position:0%
multiple layers of bail in multiple
 
01:50:47.550 --> 01:50:47.560 align:start position:0%
cases over a year year and a half and we
 
01:50:50.430 --> 01:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
never get to the point where we say
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
Society is unwilling to tolerate
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
this and and there I think the
 
01:50:58.069 --> 01:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
legislature has it within its capacity
 
01:51:00.589 --> 01:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
to identify those things that we will
 
01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
not tolerate and what volume of those
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
things that are tolerable at a
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
relatively low level are not tolerable
 
01:51:11.470 --> 01:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
at a at a high level and again um go
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
back to it I don't believe in cash bail
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
I I believe that file the rules out in
 
01:51:21.149 --> 01:51:21.159 align:start position:0%
the community you're
 
01:51:24.270 --> 01:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
good you're good to go if you're
 
01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
dangerous if you're committing new
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
crimes that's a different animal if
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
you're not showing up that's a different
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
animal and I think we should focus on
 
01:51:34.550 --> 01:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
those things and I also think we should
 
01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
focus on whether or not we have the
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
right standard of review in the current
 
01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:41.229 align:start position:0%
right standard of review in the current
baale

01:51:41.229 --> 01:51:41.239 align:start position:0%
baale
 
01:51:44.430 --> 01:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
statute with regard to that the clear
 
01:51:47.950 --> 01:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
and convincing um was what was there are
 
01:51:50.229 --> 01:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
you proposing um preponderance to the
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
evidence is is that the next level that
 
01:51:54.149 --> 01:51:54.159 align:start position:0%
you would
 
01:51:56.550 --> 01:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
prop I think that's a I think that's a
 
01:51:58.750 --> 01:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
conversation that is worth
 
01:52:01.870 --> 01:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
having um
 
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
because we've already
 
01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:06.310 align:start position:0%
because we've already
started

01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
started
 
01:52:10.229 --> 01:52:10.239 align:start position:0%
um historically probable cause
 
01:52:12.350 --> 01:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence 51 versus
 
01:52:14.830 --> 01:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
49 is the standard by which we charge
 
01:52:16.350 --> 01:52:16.360 align:start position:0%
people with criminal behavior and have
 
01:52:19.069 --> 01:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
done so since the beginning of time in
 
01:52:20.589 --> 01:52:20.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:52:22.709 --> 01:52:22.719 align:start position:0%
that's the standard that's in our
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
Constitution and we don't need a higher
 
01:52:29.790 --> 01:52:29.800 align:start position:0%
more difficult standard to make bail
 
01:52:33.229 --> 01:52:33.239 align:start position:0%
decisions um what we do need to do is to
 
01:52:35.709 --> 01:52:35.719 align:start position:0%
decide when we want to exercise the
 
01:52:38.069 --> 01:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
power of the state and identify those
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
things that are unacceptable to us as a
 
01:52:43.470 --> 01:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
society and you have the you
 
01:52:45.310 --> 01:52:45.320 align:start position:0%
collectively as the legislature have the
 
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
power to do that and I think that's what
 
01:52:50.669 --> 01:52:50.679 align:start position:0%
we need to do bright line
 
01:52:51.629 --> 01:52:51.639 align:start position:0%
in or
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
out and and and give the court the
 
01:52:58.109 --> 01:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
discretion to make these decisions but I
 
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
thought that the last baale statute gave
 
01:53:04.109 --> 01:53:04.119 align:start position:0%
something in other words the presumption
 
01:53:05.470 --> 01:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
and took it
 
01:53:09.390 --> 01:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
away when we created a standard of
 
01:53:12.790 --> 01:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
review that was so difficult to achieve
 
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
and we failed to protect the community
 
01:53:17.310 --> 01:53:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:22.030 --> 01:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:24.510 --> 01:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
okay go
 
01:53:27.790 --> 01:53:27.800 align:start position:0%
ahead in listening to your testimony I I
 
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
guess I'm sort of struggling because we
 
01:53:34.109 --> 01:53:34.119 align:start position:0%
have a list of RSA rsas here I just so
 
01:53:36.629 --> 01:53:36.639 align:start position:0%
I'm clear what you're saying these are
 
01:53:39.629 --> 01:53:39.639 align:start position:0%
ineffective what we already have that
 
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
you can hold a person um without they
 
01:53:45.629 --> 01:53:45.639 align:start position:0%
out so well you I just need to be clear
 
01:53:48.910 --> 01:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
about what you're inating what I'm what
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
I'm suggesting is that for virtually the
 
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
entire history of the state of New
 
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire these decisions regarding bail
 
01:54:01.629 --> 01:54:01.639 align:start position:0%
were were made at a preponderance of the
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
evidence standard okay and we are now
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
making them at a much higher standard
 
01:54:11.229 --> 01:54:11.239 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
logically um creates an additional
 
01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
population that's in the community who
 
01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
would otherwise have been detained at a
 
01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
lower standard and it's interesting that
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's interesting that we create a
 
01:54:28.750 --> 01:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
presumption in favor of
 
01:54:31.750 --> 01:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
detention because these behaviors are
 
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
unacceptable to us and then we create a
 
01:54:37.629 --> 01:54:37.639 align:start position:0%
higher standard by which we're going to
 
01:54:40.109 --> 01:54:40.119 align:start position:0%
execute that direction that the
 
01:54:43.270 --> 01:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
legislature has given us detain this
 
01:54:46.990 --> 01:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
person and then we make it harder to do
 
01:54:50.350 --> 01:54:50.360 align:start position:0%
that in the next step which is the
 
01:54:55.149 --> 01:54:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:57.910 --> 01:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
evidence if I'm unclear I
 
01:55:01.149 --> 01:55:01.159 align:start position:0%
apologize no I just I think if I may her
 
01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
her question was with regard to specific
 
01:55:06.189 --> 01:55:06.199 align:start position:0%
crimes not the standard of review um we
 
01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
have a list of 13 crimes proposed in the
 
01:55:11.189 --> 01:55:11.199 align:start position:0%
Senate bill that would not be subject to
 
01:55:12.990 --> 01:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
bail by a bail commissioner that would
 
01:55:16.270 --> 01:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
have to be held by a judge um and I I
 
01:55:18.109 --> 01:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
believe she was inquiring because of
 
01:55:19.990 --> 01:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
your statements with regard to how much
 
01:55:22.229 --> 01:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
will we tolerate which
 
01:55:24.669 --> 01:55:24.679 align:start position:0%
crimes well I think I
 
01:55:28.189 --> 01:55:28.199 align:start position:0%
think I think there's two two different
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
things okay the presumption is that a
 
01:55:34.430 --> 01:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
that a judge is going to come up with a
 
01:55:36.390 --> 01:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
a decision that is more likely to be
 
01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
protective to the community I'm not sure
 
01:55:40.669 --> 01:55:40.679 align:start position:0%
that that's necessarily the case the
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
judges are wetted to the law they do a
 
01:55:46.470 --> 01:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
good job um you
 
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
know I think the question becomes we're
 
01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:50.350 align:start position:0%
know I think the question becomes we're
here

01:55:50.350 --> 01:55:50.360 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
because Society is telling us that what
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
we're doing is not working that we are
 
01:55:58.870 --> 01:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
not protecting the the citizens of our
 
01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
community we're not protecting the
 
01:56:04.030 --> 01:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the criminal justice system
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
as the system is currently operating and
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
if that's true we have to look at what
 
01:56:11.229 --> 01:56:11.239 align:start position:0%
we can do
 
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:22.149 --> 01:56:22.159 align:start position:0%
um it is unquestionably true that we can
 
01:56:26.750 --> 01:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
have people out on bail multiples deep
 
01:56:31.069 --> 01:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
multiple crimes on multiple new offenses
 
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
out on bail it is an epidemic you've
 
01:56:36.629 --> 01:56:36.639 align:start position:0%
heard from my brother County attorneys
 
01:56:40.629 --> 01:56:40.639 align:start position:0%
today um people don't show
 
01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:44.159 align:start position:0%
up this is unacceptable behavior and we
 
01:56:46.109 --> 01:56:46.119 align:start position:0%
have to qu we have to quantify what
 
01:56:49.069 --> 01:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
we're willing to accept as a society and
 
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
say that there is a certain point a
 
01:56:53.390 --> 01:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
certain level of behavior that we will
 
01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
not accept or we're going to create a
 
01:56:58.669 --> 01:56:58.679 align:start position:0%
greater likelihood that Society will
 
01:57:02.069 --> 01:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
hold you pending trial and again I am
 
01:57:05.310 --> 01:57:05.320 align:start position:0%
not one of these people who who believes
 
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
that um everybody should get
 
01:57:11.030 --> 01:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
helped I think the presumption should be
 
01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
a strong presumption that people remain
 
01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
in the community but I think when you
 
01:57:18.030 --> 01:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
start committing new crimes on bail that
 
01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
we we really have to take a a good hard
 
01:57:21.669 --> 01:57:21.679 align:start position:0%
look at what we're doing and make sure
 
01:57:23.790 --> 01:57:23.800 align:start position:0%
we're being
 
01:57:27.669 --> 01:57:27.679 align:start position:0%
effective and people showing
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
up you you can have you can
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
have hearings scheduled 10 hearings
 
01:57:34.510 --> 01:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
scheduled and you're lucky if you get
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
two or
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
three uh on status
 
01:57:41.830 --> 01:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
conferences and we issue bail orders we
 
01:57:44.510 --> 01:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
bring them in and we start all over
 
01:57:45.870 --> 01:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
again and we do it
 
01:57:49.709 --> 01:57:49.719 align:start position:0%
again it is it is destructive to the
 
01:57:51.629 --> 01:57:51.639 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the system it is
 
01:57:53.229 --> 01:57:53.239 align:start position:0%
destructive to the Integrity of the
 
01:57:54.950 --> 01:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
court and it's destructive to the
 
01:57:57.669 --> 01:57:57.679 align:start position:0%
orderly process in giving Justice to
 
01:57:59.910 --> 01:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
those who have been victimized and those
 
01:58:05.550 --> 01:58:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
accused thank you for taking my question
 
01:58:11.229 --> 01:58:11.239 align:start position:0%
again so again to better understand your
 
01:58:11.239 --> 01:58:12.870 align:start position:0%
again so again to better understand your
comments

01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:58:15.390 --> 01:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
um you have
 
01:58:18.910 --> 01:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
rsas however what I hear you saying and
 
01:58:23.030 --> 01:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
tell me if wrong that um the system is
 
01:58:25.310 --> 01:58:25.320 align:start position:0%
not doing what they're supposed to those
 
01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:26.750 align:start position:0%
not doing what they're supposed to those
that

01:58:26.750 --> 01:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:29.870 --> 01:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
actually supposed to enact the law are
 
01:58:31.149 --> 01:58:31.159 align:start position:0%
not necessarily doing what they're
 
01:58:32.149 --> 01:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
supposed to
 
01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
do because if it's here and it says you
 
01:58:39.109 --> 01:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
have the right to do this about that
 
01:58:42.950 --> 01:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
person and it's not being done where is
 
01:58:44.830 --> 01:58:44.840 align:start position:0%
that happening it's not happening in the
 
01:58:47.310 --> 01:58:47.320 align:start position:0%
law because it's in the law no no the
 
01:58:49.830 --> 01:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
the so the the
 
01:58:52.470 --> 01:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
unless unless I'm mistaken I do not
 
01:58:54.830 --> 01:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
believe you're referring to mandatory
 
01:58:57.310 --> 01:58:57.320 align:start position:0%
detention I'm talking about all rather
 
01:58:59.629 --> 01:58:59.639 align:start position:0%
you're mandatory or or rather whether
 
01:59:02.229 --> 01:59:02.239 align:start position:0%
you're bailed or not bailed or those
 
01:59:05.870 --> 01:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:10.270 --> 01:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
things there are very few
 
01:59:13.030 --> 01:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which there's going to
 
01:59:15.390 --> 01:59:15.400 align:start position:0%
be mandatory detention other words the
 
01:59:17.830 --> 01:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
the law does not give the court
 
01:59:20.430 --> 01:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
discretion to release
 
01:59:25.589 --> 01:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
someone okay the vast majority of
 
01:59:29.310 --> 01:59:29.320 align:start position:0%
cases um are there the court has
 
01:59:32.310 --> 01:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
discretion and the last time we were
 
01:59:35.149 --> 01:59:35.159 align:start position:0%
here creating
 
01:59:37.950 --> 01:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
legislation we created
 
01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
presumptions in the law that said under
 
01:59:42.350 --> 01:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
these circumstances there will be
 
01:59:45.550 --> 01:59:45.560 align:start position:0%
presumptively detained some of that had
 
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
to do with conduct out on bail some of
 
01:59:52.189 --> 01:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
that had to do with um the nature of the
 
01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
offense a and then we basically said we
 
01:59:58.910 --> 01:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
really weren't serious about it because
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
we elevated the standard of
 
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
review um unless the court finds by
 
02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence
 
02:00:11.069 --> 02:00:11.079 align:start position:0%
that and it was the lord giveth the lord
 
02:00:11.079 --> 02:00:12.109 align:start position:0%
that and it was the lord giveth the lord
taketh

02:00:12.109 --> 02:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
taketh
 
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
away and the standard of
 
02:00:20.270 --> 02:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
review is as much a consideration
 
02:00:23.069 --> 02:00:23.079 align:start position:0%
as what you say you are prohibiting or
 
02:00:23.079 --> 02:00:25.189 align:start position:0%
as what you say you are prohibiting or
presumptively

02:00:25.189 --> 02:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
presumptively
 
02:00:27.629 --> 02:00:27.639 align:start position:0%
prohibiting so if I just for
 
02:00:30.990 --> 02:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
clarification you're saying that okay we
 
02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
we said we will not tolerate as a
 
02:00:35.629 --> 02:00:35.639 align:start position:0%
society a b and c they're presumptively
 
02:00:39.390 --> 02:00:39.400 align:start position:0%
detained yes and however we're going to
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
make you prove it by such a high bar
 
02:00:44.030 --> 02:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
that it's difficult to prove therefore
 
02:00:46.870 --> 02:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
we really but at at the time though were
 
02:00:48.669 --> 02:00:48.679 align:start position:0%
we not operating under the presumption
 
02:00:51.069 --> 02:00:51.079 align:start position:0%
that the clearing convincing was or may
 
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
still be the standard or well it I think
 
02:00:56.669 --> 02:00:56.679 align:start position:0%
that was what was the argued to the I
 
02:00:59.709 --> 02:00:59.719 align:start position:0%
know that was was argued
 
02:01:03.069 --> 02:01:03.079 align:start position:0%
and that was not the law
 
02:01:06.589 --> 02:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
then that is not the law now it is
 
02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
clearly not the law
 
02:01:12.229 --> 02:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
now I think I think that people had a
 
02:01:15.310 --> 02:01:15.320 align:start position:0%
good faith basis for making the argument
 
02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
that fergo stood for that um I didn't
 
02:01:24.069 --> 02:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
believe it okay um and um has the New
 
02:01:26.310 --> 02:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court um opined on it
 
02:01:28.629 --> 02:01:28.639 align:start position:0%
to the best yes that's the Oh I thought
 
02:01:30.550 --> 02:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
you were reading a US Supreme Court no
 
02:01:32.589 --> 02:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
no no no that's the that's the New
 
02:01:34.390 --> 02:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court the New
 
02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court the zalinsky
 
02:01:40.229 --> 02:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
zisy that's these motorcyclist the seven
 
02:01:42.390 --> 02:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
people dead okay yeah that's the case
 
02:01:44.910 --> 02:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court said
 
02:01:47.149 --> 02:01:47.159 align:start position:0%
that the clear and convincing standard
 
02:01:50.109 --> 02:01:50.119 align:start position:0%
is not required they said it essentially
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
that it would be a misreading of fergo
 
02:01:54.109 --> 02:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
to believe that's
 
02:01:58.229 --> 02:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
true and um and I don't fault the people
 
02:01:59.430 --> 02:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
who looked at
 
02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
fergo uh and I'm not saying that the
 
02:02:04.229 --> 02:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
people who argued that position were
 
02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
dishonest I that's not the case there
 
02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
was a legitimate robust debate I can
 
02:02:13.790 --> 02:02:13.800 align:start position:0%
tell you and I believe that almost
 
02:02:16.589 --> 02:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
anyone who practices law would tell you
 
02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
that that question has been resolved
 
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
by Zukowski and with regard to the US
 
02:02:26.149 --> 02:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court was that the Sano case no
 
02:02:28.350 --> 02:02:28.360 align:start position:0%
that was or there hasn't been a US
 
02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court I don't think there's any
 
02:02:34.030 --> 02:02:34.040 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court case that would alter
 
02:02:36.589 --> 02:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
the discussions that we're having here
 
02:02:39.510 --> 02:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
the argument regarding the burden of
 
02:02:41.550 --> 02:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
proof which was one of the central
 
02:02:45.189 --> 02:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
arguments that we had back in 18 um was
 
02:02:48.629 --> 02:02:48.639 align:start position:0%
over how we interpret uh the New
 
02:02:51.629 --> 02:02:51.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution fergal was a New
 
02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution case it cited
 
02:02:58.390 --> 02:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
solarno um which was
 
02:03:01.229 --> 02:03:01.239 align:start position:0%
a court of appeals case I believe from
 
02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
the West Coast it was an Arizona court
 
02:03:05.310 --> 02:03:05.320 align:start position:0%
of appeals case to the federal court of
 
02:03:07.550 --> 02:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
appeals and that
 
02:03:12.629 --> 02:03:12.639 align:start position:0%
site created this conversation about the
 
02:03:14.669 --> 02:03:14.679 align:start position:0%
standard of proof so that wouldn't even
 
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
apply to this District if it was from
 
02:03:18.510 --> 02:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
well no but but but the argument was
 
02:03:20.430 --> 02:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
that it did that that's what happened in
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
fergal mhm Supreme Court said no that's
 
02:03:24.189 --> 02:03:24.199 align:start position:0%
not really what happened in
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
fergal and it's very clear uh in in
 
02:03:31.470 --> 02:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
zuhowski okay we'll read that case thank
 
02:03:37.790 --> 02:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
question I had a question um you seem to
 
02:03:44.549 --> 02:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
be pretty firmly of the opinion uh that
 
02:03:46.030 --> 02:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
cash bail shouldn't be part of the
 
02:03:49.470 --> 02:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
system and I am aware of other states uh
 
02:03:52.109 --> 02:03:52.119 align:start position:0%
where cash bail has has been eliminated
 
02:03:55.229 --> 02:03:55.239 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is to you um I know
 
02:03:57.629 --> 02:03:57.639 align:start position:0%
that some of those states have struggled
 
02:04:00.189 --> 02:04:00.199 align:start position:0%
um in the same way New Hampshire uh has
 
02:04:03.390 --> 02:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
has struggled um you know with things
 
02:04:06.549 --> 02:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
like non-appearance and things like
 
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
that what are other states doing that
 
02:04:13.470 --> 02:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
that don't have cash bail uh that seems
 
02:04:16.669 --> 02:04:16.679 align:start position:0%
to be working you know um aside from
 
02:04:20.430 --> 02:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
Just Simply Having a a fairly clear road
 
02:04:30.390 --> 02:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
terms what I what I guess is what I'm
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
saying is first of all I'm not an expert
 
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
on on what other states okay have done
 
02:04:43.950 --> 02:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
um my my my dislike for cash
 
02:04:48.189 --> 02:04:48.199 align:start position:0%
bail is that it makes a decision as to
 
02:04:50.709 --> 02:04:50.719 align:start position:0%
somebody's Liberty based on how much
 
02:04:53.990 --> 02:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
money they have and that's really not
 
02:04:57.149 --> 02:04:57.159 align:start position:0%
what we should be doing okay from my
 
02:04:57.159 --> 02:04:58.910 align:start position:0%
what we should be doing okay from my
perspective

02:04:58.910 --> 02:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
02:05:03.109 --> 02:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
um and if somebody is a good
 
02:05:05.790 --> 02:05:05.800 align:start position:0%
risk and I think there should be by and
 
02:05:08.149 --> 02:05:08.159 align:start position:0%
large a presumption that most people are
 
02:05:11.189 --> 02:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
good risks that they should be released
 
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
on their word to appear and be
 
02:05:16.990 --> 02:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
good and then Society responds to the
 
02:05:20.549 --> 02:05:20.559 align:start position:0%
failure to appear and the failure to be
 
02:05:22.990 --> 02:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
good and we ask
 
02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
ourselves how much and what kind of
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
failure to be good will we
 
02:05:31.830 --> 02:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
tolerate and how many failures to appear
 
02:05:34.470 --> 02:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
will We Will We tolerate as a
 
02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
society at what point do we say that you
 
02:05:40.390 --> 02:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
are not meeting your end of that bargain
 
02:05:44.510 --> 02:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
by being good and by showing up and I
 
02:05:46.549 --> 02:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
think there should be at some juncture a
 
02:05:48.750 --> 02:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
bright line where we say no longer no
 
02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:51.320 align:start position:0%
longer can you we tolerate this you're
 
02:05:54.350 --> 02:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
detained pending trial no longer can we
 
02:05:57.629 --> 02:05:57.639 align:start position:0%
tolerate this you're detained pending
 
02:05:57.639 --> 02:05:59.589 align:start position:0%
tolerate this you're detained pending
trial

02:05:59.589 --> 02:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
trial
 
02:06:03.629 --> 02:06:03.639 align:start position:0%
and what I see in the exist the the
 
02:06:04.910 --> 02:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
prior bail
 
02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
Bill and how it is being applied as
 
02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
currently written is an almost Limitless
 
02:06:16.350 --> 02:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
Toleration for failing to appear and an
 
02:06:19.069 --> 02:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
unacceptable often times toleration for
 
02:06:20.430 --> 02:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
new Criminal
 
02:06:24.149 --> 02:06:24.159 align:start position:0%
behavior and if I had to quantify or
 
02:06:27.830 --> 02:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
rate the importance new crimes are
 
02:06:30.030 --> 02:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
probably far more important than
 
02:06:32.189 --> 02:06:32.199 align:start position:0%
failures to appear I don't know what the
 
02:06:34.629 --> 02:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
number that the legislature would find
 
02:06:37.589 --> 02:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
intolerable on failures to appear but I
 
02:06:39.709 --> 02:06:39.719 align:start position:0%
think the number of times you can commit
 
02:06:41.189 --> 02:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
new crimes while out unconditional
 
02:06:44.589 --> 02:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
release should be relatively low and I
 
02:06:46.350 --> 02:06:46.360 align:start position:0%
think there should be a gradiation
 
02:06:50.030 --> 02:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
between serious Criminal offenses
 
02:06:53.910 --> 02:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
felonies and assaults violations of
 
02:06:55.310 --> 02:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
protective order even if they're
 
02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors those kinds of things we
 
02:06:59.870 --> 02:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
cannot tolerate as a society regularly
 
02:07:03.470 --> 02:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
out on bail and maintain protection for
 
02:07:09.229 --> 02:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:11.149 --> 02:07:11.159 align:start position:0%
system thank
 
02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:21.950 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:07:21.950 --> 02:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:38.910 --> 02:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:41.189 --> 02:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
to good morning Mr chair and members of
 
02:07:43.229 --> 02:07:43.239 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is John bonsam the
 
02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
chief in Bedford and currently the
 
02:07:46.830 --> 02:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire
 
02:07:49.149 --> 02:07:49.159 align:start position:0%
Association of chiefs of police and I
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to provide
 
02:07:53.229 --> 02:07:53.239 align:start position:0%
you with some information today that
 
02:07:55.189 --> 02:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps you don't have that may be
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
Germain well not maybe but will be
 
02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
Germain to your discussions and
 
02:08:03.390 --> 02:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
deliberations with respect to uh B
 
02:08:05.709 --> 02:08:05.719 align:start position:0%
reform and first I'd like to mention
 
02:08:09.629 --> 02:08:09.639 align:start position:0%
that the previous um uh County attorney
 
02:08:13.109 --> 02:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
Hathaway I I I can't uh Echo his
 
02:08:17.549 --> 02:08:17.559 align:start position:0%
comments um and in full support of um
 
02:08:21.030 --> 02:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
the the pre premise upon which he bases
 
02:08:24.950 --> 02:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
his opinions and um his concerns uh
 
02:08:26.669 --> 02:08:26.679 align:start position:0%
which are totally shared by the chiefs
 
02:08:28.669 --> 02:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
of police but what I want to bring to
 
02:08:32.629 --> 02:08:32.639 align:start position:0%
you today is information uh that is
 
02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
particular to uh New Hampshire and it
 
02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
goes to the questions and discussions
 
02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
that you've heard um quite often about
 
02:08:45.750 --> 02:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
um people that have been arrested and
 
02:08:48.669 --> 02:08:48.679 align:start position:0%
released and arrested and released and
 
02:08:52.750 --> 02:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
so while we haven't had a system by
 
02:08:55.790 --> 02:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
which um the state or law enforcement
 
02:08:59.069 --> 02:08:59.079 align:start position:0%
agencies can tulate uh those numbers
 
02:09:01.470 --> 02:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
with any degree of accuracy I'm here to
 
02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
tell you that state actually did enjoin
 
02:09:07.270 --> 02:09:07.280 align:start position:0%
a contract with the Council of state
 
02:09:09.069 --> 02:09:09.079 align:start position:0%
governments in
 
02:09:11.549 --> 02:09:11.559 align:start position:0%
2022 and is called the New Hampshire
 
02:09:15.629 --> 02:09:15.639 align:start position:0%
Justice reinvestment act an initiative
 
02:09:19.189 --> 02:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
and essentially what that initiative did
 
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
was to under contract require the uh
 
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
National Council of state governments to
 
02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
look at um the high utilization and
 
02:09:32.669 --> 02:09:32.679 align:start position:0%
persistent utilization of County jails
 
02:09:35.669 --> 02:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh throughout New Hampshire and to
 
02:09:39.149 --> 02:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
determine um and to determine why this
 
02:09:41.549 --> 02:09:41.559 align:start position:0%
was happening and perhaps uh develop
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
some key points and elements so very
 
02:09:47.470 --> 02:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
briefly without keeping you long um I
 
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
think this information may be very
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
helpful to you and I'll provide uh the
 
02:09:54.549 --> 02:09:54.559 align:start position:0%
committee with a copy uh of this as well
 
02:09:55.709 --> 02:09:55.719 align:start position:0%
before I
 
02:09:58.669 --> 02:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
leave essentially uh there were three
 
02:10:02.109 --> 02:10:02.119 align:start position:0%
challenges that the state identified uh
 
02:10:03.790 --> 02:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
one that there's a small number of
 
02:10:05.870 --> 02:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
people cycling through the jails in New
 
02:10:09.390 --> 02:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh that are utilizing uh a
 
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
substantial number of resources at Great
 
02:10:16.109 --> 02:10:16.119 align:start position:0%
cost to the counties and to the state uh
 
02:10:20.189 --> 02:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
two High utilizers of jail Services had
 
02:10:22.390 --> 02:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
more complex and more frequent
 
02:10:25.270 --> 02:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health and other related
 
02:10:28.510 --> 02:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
encounters than non-high utilizers of
 
02:10:31.470 --> 02:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
jail services and thirdly and this is
 
02:10:33.270 --> 02:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
something that was discussed previously
 
02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
today in your committee that re-entry
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
and Community Services vary greatly uh
 
02:10:42.109 --> 02:10:42.119 align:start position:0%
from County to County uh in New
 
02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire contributing to long wait
 
02:10:49.430 --> 02:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
times uh and significant gaps in um
 
02:10:52.709 --> 02:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
reintegration Services particularly for
 
02:10:55.709 --> 02:10:55.719 align:start position:0%
the high utilizers of Jael resources so
 
02:10:58.950 --> 02:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
here are some essential key findings and
 
02:11:00.589 --> 02:11:00.599 align:start position:0%
these are numbers that I think are are
 
02:11:02.310 --> 02:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
both starking and
 
02:11:05.870 --> 02:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
revealing um jail High utilizers
 
02:11:09.790 --> 02:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
accounted for 9% of the jail population
 
02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
but actually
 
02:11:16.149 --> 02:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
34% of jail entrances and approximately
 
02:11:20.790 --> 02:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
29% of jail cost for fiscal year 19 to
 
02:11:25.149 --> 02:11:25.159 align:start position:0%
21 let me say that again 9% of the jail
 
02:11:28.830 --> 02:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
population um accounted for 34% of the
 
02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
jail entrances that means that a
 
02:11:34.629 --> 02:11:34.639 align:start position:0%
relatively low number of people are
 
02:11:36.629 --> 02:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
cycling through New Hampshire County
 
02:11:39.709 --> 02:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
jails over and over and over again which
 
02:11:41.549 --> 02:11:41.559 align:start position:0%
is consistent with with what you've
 
02:11:45.510 --> 02:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
heard from members of uh law enforcement
 
02:11:49.189 --> 02:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
myself uh as well as County prosecutors
 
02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
um now of those 9% that account for 34%
 
02:11:57.430 --> 02:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
of the jail entrances U remarkably and
 
02:11:57.440 --> 02:11:58.629 align:start position:0%
of the jail entrances U remarkably and
sadly

02:11:58.629 --> 02:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
sadly
 
02:12:03.470 --> 02:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
84% of those uh 9% were diagnosed with a
 
02:12:06.270 --> 02:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder as the primary
 
02:12:09.430 --> 02:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
diagnosis now this information is coming
 
02:12:13.229 --> 02:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
from Medicare data that was obtained by
 
02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
the Council of state government so these
 
02:12:18.709 --> 02:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
These are actually uh diagnoses uh that
 
02:12:20.430 --> 02:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
were obtained as a result of medical
 
02:12:24.549 --> 02:12:24.559 align:start position:0%
records so 84% of that 9% presented with
 
02:12:27.430 --> 02:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
a substance use disorder and
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
69% of the
 
02:12:32.470 --> 02:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
84% right 69% of the
 
02:12:37.030 --> 02:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
84% um presented with opioid related um
 
02:12:40.149 --> 02:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
primary diagnosis right and uh
 
02:12:43.390 --> 02:12:43.400 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough only 33% presented
 
02:12:46.870 --> 02:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
with alcohol rated primary diagnosis
 
02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
right um if and Behavioral Health uh
 
02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:51.990 align:start position:0%
right um if and Behavioral Health uh
constituted

02:12:51.990 --> 02:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
constituted
 
02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:53.549 align:start position:0%
constituted
73%

02:12:53.549 --> 02:12:53.559 align:start position:0%
73%
 
02:12:59.390 --> 02:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
so uh overall uh 59 89% of the high
 
02:13:02.990 --> 02:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
utilizers in fiscal years 15 to 21 had a
 
02:13:05.830 --> 02:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
history of Medicaid enrollment uh and of
 
02:13:09.189 --> 02:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
that population 93% had a behavioral
 
02:13:12.030 --> 02:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
health claim so what we're seeing here
 
02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
is uh factual data as as a result of
 
02:13:17.669 --> 02:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
this study that is particular to just
 
02:13:19.470 --> 02:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
new Hampshire now this is just New
 
02:13:22.549 --> 02:13:22.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh with respect to those folks
 
02:13:24.910 --> 02:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
that are cycling through County jails
 
02:13:27.390 --> 02:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
over and over again um that are
 
02:13:29.709 --> 02:13:29.719 align:start position:0%
accounting for a high number of jail
 
02:13:31.870 --> 02:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
entrances but actually are very less
 
02:13:35.350 --> 02:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
than 10% of the population and of that
 
02:13:39.589 --> 02:13:39.599 align:start position:0%
population a significant um amount of
 
02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
those folks uh over 80% 84% actually uh
 
02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
were diagnosed with an um opioid related
 
02:13:50.709 --> 02:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder uh or a substance
 
02:13:54.669 --> 02:13:54.679 align:start position:0%
use disorder and um 70% had an opioid
 
02:13:59.390 --> 02:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder um diagnosis uh
 
02:14:02.430 --> 02:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
the takeaway from the law enforcement
 
02:14:04.589 --> 02:14:04.599 align:start position:0%
perspective uh and again I'll provide
 
02:14:06.790 --> 02:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
the committee with a copy of this is
 
02:14:09.149 --> 02:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
that this um
 
02:14:12.229 --> 02:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
validates um the concerns that you've
 
02:14:14.669 --> 02:14:14.679 align:start position:0%
heard uh from uh County attorney
 
02:14:16.549 --> 02:14:16.559 align:start position:0%
Hathaway and myself and others in law
 
02:14:19.310 --> 02:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement regard ing folks that are
 
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
cycling through the
 
02:14:24.669 --> 02:14:24.679 align:start position:0%
system uh over and over again um and so
 
02:14:27.549 --> 02:14:27.559 align:start position:0%
the other key elements uh that were
 
02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
obtained as a result of this study in
 
02:14:33.390 --> 02:14:33.400 align:start position:0%
comparison to the nonh high utilizers
 
02:14:36.109 --> 02:14:36.119 align:start position:0%
the high utilizers in fiscal year 19 and
 
02:14:38.709 --> 02:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
fisc through fiscal year 21 had a
 
02:14:41.149 --> 02:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
greater likelihood of being booked into
 
02:14:43.790 --> 02:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
jail for lower level crimes such as
 
02:14:46.109 --> 02:14:46.119 align:start position:0%
criminal trespassing probation parole
 
02:14:48.750 --> 02:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
violations and failure to appear
 
02:14:51.629 --> 02:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
uh on bail charges um and were less
 
02:14:54.030 --> 02:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
likely to be booked in for violent crime
 
02:14:57.430 --> 02:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
so there there are two distinct issues
 
02:15:00.750 --> 02:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
that um I think are presented uh for you
 
02:15:03.430 --> 02:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
as a committee to look at one is the
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
concern of the um Community uh and
 
02:15:12.149 --> 02:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
Society has on how people that are
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
charged with violent crime are handled
 
02:15:18.030 --> 02:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
initially um through the baale system
 
02:15:21.910 --> 02:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
and secondly this particular study looks
 
02:15:25.189 --> 02:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
at um and validates the concern for
 
02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
those folks uh who are committing
 
02:15:29.149 --> 02:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
low-level crimes that are cycling
 
02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
through the system over and over and
 
02:15:35.470 --> 02:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
over again uh and then finally uh the
 
02:15:37.990 --> 02:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
key takeaway is that and we know from
 
02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
law enforcement that most of those folks
 
02:15:44.189 --> 02:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
that are uh charged and um processed
 
02:15:46.870 --> 02:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
through the system uh certainly at least
 
02:15:48.830 --> 02:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
in in our County and Hillsboro County
 
02:15:52.669 --> 02:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
the most populous County uh are um
 
02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
committing those crimes and having an
 
02:15:56.189 --> 02:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
underlying substance used to sorder
 
02:15:58.870 --> 02:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
diagnosis right um but yet they're
 
02:16:01.950 --> 02:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
continually released um bail orders
 
02:16:05.709 --> 02:16:05.719 align:start position:0%
often times uh and most uh most
 
02:16:08.750 --> 02:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
oftentimes require the individual who
 
02:16:10.270 --> 02:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
has that underlying substance use
 
02:16:11.350 --> 02:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
disorder that was brought to the
 
02:16:13.030 --> 02:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
attention of the Court typically by
 
02:16:16.109 --> 02:16:16.119 align:start position:0%
defense counsel um uh places that
 
02:16:17.709 --> 02:16:17.719 align:start position:0%
individual on orders to seek treat
 
02:16:20.030 --> 02:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
treatment and in the vast majority of
 
02:16:23.109 --> 02:16:23.119 align:start position:0%
those cases those folks um don't seek
 
02:16:26.069 --> 02:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
treatment um they reoffend uh fail to
 
02:16:28.510 --> 02:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
appear uh they miss their court dates
 
02:16:30.189 --> 02:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
and they cycle back through the system
 
02:16:33.389 --> 02:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
again and again um so one uh one of the
 
02:16:36.830 --> 02:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
areas that we've explored uh and some
 
02:16:38.910 --> 02:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
counties are exploring it I know
 
02:16:40.549 --> 02:16:40.559 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County the superintendent of
 
02:16:45.910 --> 02:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
jails is looking at a um incarcerating
 
02:16:49.110 --> 02:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
program that would uh interrupt the
 
02:16:51.790 --> 02:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
cycle of offending and release by folks
 
02:16:53.750 --> 02:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
who have an underlying substance use
 
02:16:56.469 --> 02:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
disorder by requiring them to be
 
02:16:58.469 --> 02:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
committed to jail for a period of time
 
02:17:03.629 --> 02:17:03.639 align:start position:0%
to undergo a uh medically assisted um
 
02:17:06.990 --> 02:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
proven uh successful uh drug and
 
02:17:09.070 --> 02:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
substance use treatment program before
 
02:17:12.669 --> 02:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
they're released um that would interrupt
 
02:17:17.190 --> 02:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
the cycle of 89% of that 9% um that are
 
02:17:20.549 --> 02:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
cycling through the county jails um uh
 
02:17:22.990 --> 02:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again so uh very
 
02:17:24.870 --> 02:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
interesting numbers this is again
 
02:17:27.709 --> 02:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
Germaine um to New Hampshire and I think
 
02:17:29.669 --> 02:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
is important for you folks to hear and I
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
give thank you for the opportunity
 
02:17:32.950 --> 02:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
giving it to you today Chief if you
 
02:17:35.549 --> 02:17:35.559 align:start position:0%
could um for the benefit of the
 
02:17:37.790 --> 02:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
committee those those were jail numbers
 
02:17:40.750 --> 02:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
not prison numbers so could you talk
 
02:17:43.230 --> 02:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
about what offenses are are sentenced to
 
02:17:46.509 --> 02:17:46.519 align:start position:0%
jail versus prison um so we're talking
 
02:17:48.910 --> 02:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
mostly those are mostly misdemeanors or
 
02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
at least that they pled to or accepted
 
02:17:53.150 --> 02:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
time for is that correct that's correct
 
02:17:54.830 --> 02:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
right so so for the benefit of the
 
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
committee if you're sentenced for a
 
02:17:57.629 --> 02:17:57.639 align:start position:0%
felony you go to state prison if it's a
 
02:17:59.309 --> 02:17:59.319 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor or you plead to a
 
02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor that used to be a felony you
 
02:18:02.750 --> 02:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
end up in in the jail system so those
 
02:18:04.469 --> 02:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
numbers applied mostly to the defenses
 
02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
that we're discussing as far as um the
 
02:18:09.270 --> 02:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
the burden on the
 
02:18:11.150 --> 02:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
system and did you have anything else
 
02:18:12.549 --> 02:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
you wanted to add based on what you've
 
02:18:15.389 --> 02:18:15.399 align:start position:0%
heard here today no this is uh this is
 
02:18:17.349 --> 02:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
all uh you know County attorney hat to
 
02:18:20.230 --> 02:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
way did a remarkable remarkable job in
 
02:18:24.270 --> 02:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
um uh putting the problem uh in
 
02:18:26.669 --> 02:18:26.679 align:start position:0%
perspective uh before you as the
 
02:18:30.870 --> 02:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
committee um to get a more strategic and
 
02:18:34.429 --> 02:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
50,000 foot level uh uh to try to get
 
02:18:38.709 --> 02:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
our arms around uh What uh is facing us
 
02:18:40.709 --> 02:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
um that has led to the perception that
 
02:18:43.669 --> 02:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice system is more of
 
02:18:46.629 --> 02:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
an annoyance than it is a corrective
 
02:18:49.950 --> 02:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
mechanism in syst Society is based on
 
02:18:52.629 --> 02:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
the lack of respect of that system due
 
02:18:57.509 --> 02:18:57.519 align:start position:0%
largely in part to uh the the fact and
 
02:19:00.910 --> 02:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
it is fact that most people are are are
 
02:19:05.910 --> 02:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
not uh incentivized to follow the law uh
 
02:19:07.629 --> 02:19:07.639 align:start position:0%
because of a lack of
 
02:19:11.629 --> 02:19:11.639 align:start position:0%
consequences right and so uh what we see
 
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
here is in these numbers a clear uh
 
02:19:20.110 --> 02:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
remarkable U manifest station that uh a
 
02:19:22.429 --> 02:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
number of people uh a small number of
 
02:19:24.190 --> 02:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
people as County attorney Hathaway had
 
02:19:26.790 --> 02:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
indicated are responsible for a high
 
02:19:30.589 --> 02:19:30.599 align:start position:0%
number of reoffending type of crimes so
 
02:19:33.629 --> 02:19:33.639 align:start position:0%
those are the folks that that we need to
 
02:19:38.309 --> 02:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
focus on uh not the other uh
 
02:19:41.589 --> 02:19:41.599 align:start position:0%
91% uh of folks but we need to focus on
 
02:19:45.270 --> 02:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
that 9% that are accounting for 34% of
 
02:19:47.549 --> 02:19:47.559 align:start position:0%
the jail entrances and and again these
 
02:19:49.429 --> 02:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
are jail entrances not arrest so that
 
02:19:52.389 --> 02:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
means that these folks likely have been
 
02:19:55.710 --> 02:19:55.720 align:start position:0%
arrested released on PR Bond a number of
 
02:19:58.110 --> 02:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
times before they actually land in a
 
02:20:01.990 --> 02:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
county jail so uh that's another
 
02:20:03.870 --> 02:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
consideration that I think needs to be
 
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
brought to light
 
02:20:08.510 --> 02:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
here you discussed um
 
02:20:13.790 --> 02:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
a a mandatory um substance abuse program
 
02:20:16.670 --> 02:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
that would be um taken care of in in
 
02:20:18.270 --> 02:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
while you were in car
 
02:20:21.469 --> 02:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
erated that's post conviction I take it
 
02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
that that wouldn't be while you were on
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
bail what services are available that
 
02:20:28.349 --> 02:20:28.359 align:start position:0%
you're aware of that could be used while
 
02:20:30.590 --> 02:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
someone was on bail for example
 
02:20:33.030 --> 02:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
someone's arrested bailed picked up
 
02:20:35.030 --> 02:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
again and it's determined that they have
 
02:20:36.950 --> 02:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
a substance abuse problem versus saying
 
02:20:38.469 --> 02:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to hold
 
02:20:40.710 --> 02:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
them what what's available as an
 
02:20:42.870 --> 02:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
alternative to actually interrupt that
 
02:20:45.110 --> 02:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
cycle while they're on bail by sending
 
02:20:46.830 --> 02:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
them somewhere for for some type of
 
02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:48.309 align:start position:0%
them somewhere for for some type of
services

02:20:48.309 --> 02:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:20:51.230 --> 02:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
as the study indicated those Services
 
02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
vary greatly and widely by County um
 
02:20:56.710 --> 02:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
some counties have a more robust
 
02:21:00.510 --> 02:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
pre-trial Service uh and um oftentimes a
 
02:21:03.429 --> 02:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
reintegration program and other counties
 
02:21:06.630 --> 02:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
based on volume and staffing issues have
 
02:21:10.230 --> 02:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
much less so one of the recommendations
 
02:21:12.990 --> 02:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
certainly would be to have the state
 
02:21:18.630 --> 02:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
look at um providing for a consistent a
 
02:21:22.429 --> 02:21:22.439 align:start position:0%
well-funded um defined pre-trial service
 
02:21:24.670 --> 02:21:24.680 align:start position:0%
system throughout all the counties to be
 
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
able to better serve folks the um the
 
02:21:33.070 --> 02:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
introduction of opioid abatement funds U
 
02:21:35.710 --> 02:21:35.720 align:start position:0%
which are now flowing into the state uh
 
02:21:39.630 --> 02:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
every year um we believe could be used
 
02:21:44.110 --> 02:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh to support the development and the um
 
02:21:46.510 --> 02:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
deployment of medically assisted
 
02:21:48.550 --> 02:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
substance use treatment programs in
 
02:21:52.510 --> 02:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
county jails uh that I believe uh in my
 
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
years 27 years in Drug law enforcement
 
02:21:58.230 --> 02:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
um and 45 years on law enforcement per
 
02:22:03.550 --> 02:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
se uh suggests to me that folks that um
 
02:22:05.550 --> 02:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
are under bail conditions because they
 
02:22:08.550 --> 02:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
have a substance use disorder and
 
02:22:11.990 --> 02:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
continually refuse to Avail themselves
 
02:22:14.469 --> 02:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
of the treatment and Recovery systems
 
02:22:16.190 --> 02:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
that are out there today much more so
 
02:22:18.469 --> 02:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
than there were six or seven years ago
 
02:22:22.070 --> 02:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
so those services do exist but they they
 
02:22:25.510 --> 02:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
frankly ignore them um and they reoffend
 
02:22:27.710 --> 02:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
a medically assisted incarcerated
 
02:22:30.910 --> 02:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
treatment program would be uh available
 
02:22:33.190 --> 02:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully funded through this opioid
 
02:22:36.309 --> 02:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
abatement fund uh uh to be able to
 
02:22:39.389 --> 02:22:39.399 align:start position:0%
interrupt that cycle and again uh as
 
02:22:42.309 --> 02:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
attorney cath attorney hathway indicated
 
02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
this is not for the very first time that
 
02:22:47.510 --> 02:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
a person uh is arrested uh for a
 
02:22:50.150 --> 02:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
low-level crime and has a substance use
 
02:22:53.349 --> 02:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
disorder diagnosis uh this would be for
 
02:22:57.150 --> 02:22:57.160 align:start position:0%
those folks that um are in the gap
 
02:23:00.710 --> 02:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
between multiple offenses um and
 
02:23:03.870 --> 02:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
releases and those that are then
 
02:23:06.469 --> 02:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
eventually sentenced to drug court
 
02:23:09.030 --> 02:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
because a lot the drug courts which do
 
02:23:13.150 --> 02:23:13.160 align:start position:0%
work well unfortunately do not have the
 
02:23:15.750 --> 02:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
capacity do not have the capacity to
 
02:23:20.590 --> 02:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
deal with the tsunami of folks that as
 
02:23:23.309 --> 02:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
these numbers indicate um are producing
 
02:23:26.150 --> 02:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
in the state so something in
 
02:23:29.309 --> 02:23:29.319 align:start position:0%
between um where we're simply releasing
 
02:23:32.030 --> 02:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
folks with a substance use disorder and
 
02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
they are not availing themselves of
 
02:23:36.429 --> 02:23:36.439 align:start position:0%
treatment and then waiting one or two
 
02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
years where they've accumulated um a
 
02:23:42.429 --> 02:23:42.439 align:start position:0%
whole range of offenses and re and
 
02:23:44.910 --> 02:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
releases and then perhaps maybe put them
 
02:23:48.230 --> 02:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
in drug court let's stop that py
 
02:23:51.349 --> 02:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh before it gets to the point where
 
02:23:54.429 --> 02:23:54.439 align:start position:0%
it's gone well beyond what's as attorney
 
02:23:58.469 --> 02:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
haway so aply put Society is willing to
 
02:24:02.190 --> 02:24:02.200 align:start position:0%
tolerate thank you
 
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
02:24:07.110 --> 02:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
M I wanted to thank you for bringing
 
02:24:08.990 --> 02:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
that report to light um and I also
 
02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to let the other members of the
 
02:24:12.349 --> 02:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
committee know that this was actually
 
02:24:14.750 --> 02:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
the report that I sent out to everybody
 
02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh about a month ago and we when we
 
02:24:18.590 --> 02:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
started so
 
02:24:22.710 --> 02:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
um I think this is one of the maybe the
 
02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
single most nagging uh systemic issue uh
 
02:24:30.910 --> 02:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
that we're dealing with uh currently um
 
02:24:34.510 --> 02:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
and uh and unfortunately there doesn't
 
02:24:39.309 --> 02:24:39.319 align:start position:0%
seem to be um uh any super reliable way
 
02:24:41.269 --> 02:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
at this point of of dealing with it I
 
02:24:42.990 --> 02:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
know that the when the commission made
 
02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
its recommendations there were some
 
02:24:47.510 --> 02:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
people who who looked at them I was I
 
02:24:51.830 --> 02:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
was one of them um and I think a huge
 
02:24:53.110 --> 02:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
question for us
 
02:24:57.070 --> 02:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
is where we go from here um in the
 
02:25:00.790 --> 02:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
context of trying to rework or rework
 
02:25:04.190 --> 02:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
our bail laws I think it becomes easier
 
02:25:07.230 --> 02:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
for us to do that if we know that
 
02:25:09.550 --> 02:25:09.560 align:start position:0%
there's a way we can actually do what
 
02:25:11.670 --> 02:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting we do which is to try
 
02:25:14.429 --> 02:25:14.439 align:start position:0%
to find a way to to break this
 
02:25:21.349 --> 02:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
cycle um so I am 100% in favor of of
 
02:25:24.190 --> 02:25:24.200 align:start position:0%
anything that you know that can that can
 
02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
do that um but one one question I did
 
02:25:31.950 --> 02:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
have for you is in
 
02:25:34.590 --> 02:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
terms so breaking the cycle seems to be
 
02:25:37.750 --> 02:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
something that we can do uh it it seemed
 
02:25:39.950 --> 02:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
to it seems to require a conviction to
 
02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
do that um this doesn't seem we we can't
 
02:25:45.670 --> 02:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
just we can't presume people are guilty
 
02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
of an offense before they've been been
 
02:25:49.349 --> 02:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
convicted in in a court of
 
02:25:53.389 --> 02:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
law are there ways uh that you've heard
 
02:25:55.230 --> 02:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
about in your conversations with other
 
02:25:57.070 --> 02:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
Chiefs or national
 
02:26:00.150 --> 02:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
organizations how other states other
 
02:26:04.030 --> 02:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
localities may be finding a way to get
 
02:26:07.469 --> 02:26:07.479 align:start position:0%
people some help uh before
 
02:26:10.150 --> 02:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
conviction um
 
02:26:12.710 --> 02:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
the and I I think you know one of the
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
things we've heard about our our various
 
02:26:18.309 --> 02:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
pre-trial programs so one of the things
 
02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
that I'm curious about is how are so
 
02:26:23.950 --> 02:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
many people
 
02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
falling you know kind of into those
 
02:26:29.469 --> 02:26:29.479 align:start position:0%
cracks even though those programs exist
 
02:26:32.110 --> 02:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
you know what what's what's happening
 
02:26:34.510 --> 02:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
you know where are the where are the
 
02:26:36.550 --> 02:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
holes that we need to close I guess
 
02:26:38.590 --> 02:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
02:26:40.870 --> 02:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you for your question and
 
02:26:43.990 --> 02:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh I hope if I understood it properly
 
02:26:45.710 --> 02:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll try to address I think there's
 
02:26:48.230 --> 02:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
a couple of questions in there there one
 
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
um relates to how
 
02:26:54.230 --> 02:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
to um address pre-conviction
 
02:26:58.110 --> 02:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
those folks who have a underlying
 
02:27:02.230 --> 02:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder um that is uh
 
02:27:05.030 --> 02:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
driving their criminal Behavior to to a
 
02:27:08.830 --> 02:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
large extent and we here in New
 
02:27:12.429 --> 02:27:12.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh if we for a
 
02:27:16.309 --> 02:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
moment dial the clock back to 2014 and
 
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
20 5 when the opioid problem began to
 
02:27:23.990 --> 02:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
surface um in a large way in in the
 
02:27:26.510 --> 02:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we were we were
 
02:27:29.550 --> 02:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
not in a position in the state of New
 
02:27:32.309 --> 02:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be able to offer with any
 
02:27:34.630 --> 02:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
degree of certainty or
 
02:27:37.750 --> 02:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
regularity uh substance use treatment or
 
02:27:41.070 --> 02:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
Recovery Services in fact I can recall
 
02:27:43.269 --> 02:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
at a conference at the Bedford Village
 
02:27:48.469 --> 02:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
in um there was a uh speaker and that
 
02:27:50.910 --> 02:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
speaker was from Florida and in doing
 
02:27:53.389 --> 02:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
some research I was able to determine
 
02:27:54.750 --> 02:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
that there were more treatment in
 
02:27:57.309 --> 02:27:57.319 align:start position:0%
recovery beds in the city of Tampa
 
02:27:59.670 --> 02:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
Florida at the time than there was in
 
02:28:02.469 --> 02:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
the entire State of New Hampshire right
 
02:28:06.750 --> 02:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
but since then we've come a long way in
 
02:28:09.429 --> 02:28:09.439 align:start position:0%
providing for services treatment and
 
02:28:11.990 --> 02:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
Recovery in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:28:15.110 --> 02:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh some may say that we're not where we
 
02:28:18.590 --> 02:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
are yet or where we should be yet but we
 
02:28:21.469 --> 02:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
have come quite a long
 
02:28:26.349 --> 02:28:26.359 align:start position:0%
way the problem that you bring uh into
 
02:28:31.070 --> 02:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
discussion is the individuals or segment
 
02:28:34.910 --> 02:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
of that cohort that are facing criminal
 
02:28:37.950 --> 02:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
charges with an underlying substance use
 
02:28:40.389 --> 02:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
disorder uh and have been
 
02:28:44.150 --> 02:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
told by the court that you need to treat
 
02:28:50.070 --> 02:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
that um and yet they fail to Avail
 
02:28:52.870 --> 02:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
themselves of the court-ordered
 
02:28:55.429 --> 02:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
treatment that is required to address
 
02:28:57.590 --> 02:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
their underlying
 
02:29:00.710 --> 02:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
diagnosis uh that goes to the
 
02:29:03.630 --> 02:29:03.640 align:start position:0%
psychology of of drug addiction and the
 
02:29:06.510 --> 02:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
state of substance use here in the
 
02:29:09.230 --> 02:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
United States and as some of the members
 
02:29:12.429 --> 02:29:12.439 align:start position:0%
of the committee may know I spent 27
 
02:29:15.309 --> 02:29:15.319 align:start position:0%
years with us Drug Enforcement
 
02:29:17.750 --> 02:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
Administration uh and so I have quite a
 
02:29:19.710 --> 02:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
bit of knowledge
 
02:29:23.349 --> 02:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
about um that area of of
 
02:29:25.790 --> 02:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
psychology and criminal element and I
 
02:29:30.590 --> 02:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
can tell you that um the substance use
 
02:29:33.750 --> 02:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
problem that we face today here in the
 
02:29:36.309 --> 02:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
United States is worse than it's ever
 
02:29:39.590 --> 02:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
been in the almost half century that
 
02:29:41.870 --> 02:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
I've been involved in law enforcement
 
02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
across the
 
02:29:46.710 --> 02:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
country uh with more than 110,000 people
 
02:29:48.950 --> 02:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
dead from drug
 
02:29:51.990 --> 02:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
overdoses um most of those not all but
 
02:29:55.389 --> 02:29:55.399 align:start position:0%
most of those folks from disadvantage
 
02:29:59.910 --> 02:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
communities uh is um is a is a
 
02:30:03.469 --> 02:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
stain um on the American
 
02:30:07.190 --> 02:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
flag and we were still struggling to try
 
02:30:11.510 --> 02:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
to deal with this um and yet haven't
 
02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
found the
 
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
solution one thing I can tell you and I
 
02:30:18.590 --> 02:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
think it's it comes from both my
 
02:30:20.910 --> 02:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
experience ladies and gentlemen as well
 
02:30:23.630 --> 02:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
as simple common sense that you all
 
02:30:28.150 --> 02:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
possess and that simply is this today
 
02:30:31.510 --> 02:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
the powerful nature and addictive nature
 
02:30:34.990 --> 02:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
of the drugs and the morbidity
 
02:30:37.030 --> 02:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
associated with the drugs that are
 
02:30:39.150 --> 02:30:39.160 align:start position:0%
available on the streets of conquer New
 
02:30:41.070 --> 02:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not far from where you're
 
02:30:44.230 --> 02:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
sitting or in the streets of Manchester
 
02:30:46.950 --> 02:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
or most communities in New Hampshire
 
02:30:48.950 --> 02:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
are so powerfully
 
02:30:50.950 --> 02:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
psychologically as well as
 
02:30:54.469 --> 02:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
physiologically addictive that people
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
will risk their lives on a daily basis
 
02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
multiple times knowing full well that
 
02:31:03.150 --> 02:31:03.160 align:start position:0%
this could be the last time that they
 
02:31:06.110 --> 02:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
take a drug or a breath of air on this
 
02:31:09.750 --> 02:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
Earth and yet they still continue to be
 
02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
engaged in that behavior there is no
 
02:31:17.070 --> 02:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
amount of criminal incentive
 
02:31:18.790 --> 02:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's going to stop
 
02:31:21.590 --> 02:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
someone uh from engaging in that
 
02:31:25.110 --> 02:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
behavior so what what what do we
 
02:31:28.110 --> 02:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
do uh and I think these numbers that you
 
02:31:29.550 --> 02:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
sent out to your
 
02:31:33.510 --> 02:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
committee give us a glimpse of what we
 
02:31:37.590 --> 02:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
may be able to do because there are
 
02:31:39.510 --> 02:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
effective substance use treatment
 
02:31:43.429 --> 02:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
programs out there today right there are
 
02:31:45.990 --> 02:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
and we need desperately ladies and
 
02:31:48.990 --> 02:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
gentlemen need to leverage the criminal
 
02:31:52.750 --> 02:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
justice system to take people who are
 
02:31:55.630 --> 02:31:55.640 align:start position:0%
continually engaged in this destructive
 
02:31:58.429 --> 02:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
behavior that cost so many lives more
 
02:32:01.990 --> 02:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
than 480 in the past couple of years per
 
02:32:03.590 --> 02:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
year in New Hampshire and we're on the
 
02:32:06.469 --> 02:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
trajectory to at least uh meet that this
 
02:32:09.790 --> 02:32:09.800 align:start position:0%
year uh to take those folks and say we
 
02:32:13.429 --> 02:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
know that this addictive nature of this
 
02:32:16.349 --> 02:32:16.359 align:start position:0%
type of problem that you have is not
 
02:32:18.590 --> 02:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
something that
 
02:32:22.269 --> 02:32:22.279 align:start position:0%
is most people can bring themselves to
 
02:32:23.950 --> 02:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
address themselves so what we are going
 
02:32:26.990 --> 02:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
to do is we're going to use the criminal
 
02:32:30.950 --> 02:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
justice system as a lever to say look
 
02:32:33.990 --> 02:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
while we have you as a result of this
 
02:32:36.070 --> 02:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
criminal charge and we know that you
 
02:32:40.950 --> 02:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
have this problem here's a uh program
 
02:32:46.070 --> 02:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
that is 67 to 73% effective in solving
 
02:32:48.349 --> 02:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
the that problem that is causing you the
 
02:32:48.359 --> 02:32:49.590 align:start position:0%
the that problem that is causing you the
destructive

02:32:49.590 --> 02:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
destructive
 
02:32:53.269 --> 02:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
Behavior why don't we do that more often
 
02:32:55.630 --> 02:32:55.640 align:start position:0%
the funds now we used to say that we
 
02:32:57.950 --> 02:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
didn't have the money it's a it's
 
02:33:00.190 --> 02:33:00.200 align:start position:0%
expensive uh when we first started to
 
02:33:02.750 --> 02:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
have the opioid problem in New Hampshire
 
02:33:06.269 --> 02:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
back in 145 and 16 I believe Rockingham
 
02:33:09.110 --> 02:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
County was leading the charge with U
 
02:33:11.429 --> 02:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
incarcerate of treatment programs and it
 
02:33:13.990 --> 02:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
was a really good program but it's
 
02:33:17.230 --> 02:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
costly now we have a a lot of money
 
02:33:19.230 --> 02:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
coming in by truckloads into the state
 
02:33:20.990 --> 02:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire from the opioid
 
02:33:24.389 --> 02:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
settlements why don't we use that money
 
02:33:27.429 --> 02:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
right to interrupt the cycle of criminal
 
02:33:31.469 --> 02:33:31.479 align:start position:0%
behavior and address at least an 80 80%
 
02:33:34.469 --> 02:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
of that 9% the underlying substance use
 
02:33:36.389 --> 02:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
disorder that's driving that criminal
 
02:33:39.429 --> 02:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
Behavior if that's successful based on
 
02:33:41.230 --> 02:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
the numbers that you see from these
 
02:33:43.590 --> 02:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
medically assisted treatment programs
 
02:33:45.550 --> 02:33:45.560 align:start position:0%
such as the one that's used in the main
 
02:33:47.469 --> 02:33:47.479 align:start position:0%
State Prison
 
02:33:48.870 --> 02:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
that the federal government is looking
 
02:33:52.670 --> 02:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
at uh as an example right we would
 
02:33:55.990 --> 02:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
reduce substantially reduced the number
 
02:33:59.269 --> 02:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
of people that are offending tying up
 
02:34:02.990 --> 02:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
criminal justice police courts um uh
 
02:34:06.190 --> 02:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
pre-trial services and jail
 
02:34:08.469 --> 02:34:08.479 align:start position:0%
resources and they would be productive
 
02:34:09.670 --> 02:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
members of
 
02:34:12.429 --> 02:34:12.439 align:start position:0%
society if we can just bring that number
 
02:34:16.790 --> 02:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
down by half not even the 60 or 70%
 
02:34:19.550 --> 02:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
it would be a remarkable Improvement in
 
02:34:21.830 --> 02:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
where we're going but to be able to do
 
02:34:24.469 --> 02:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
that this committee needs to look at
 
02:34:28.870 --> 02:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
ways of allowing the criminal justice
 
02:34:31.550 --> 02:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
system to be able to operate more
 
02:34:34.230 --> 02:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
effectively as County attorney Hathaway
 
02:34:37.950 --> 02:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
uh so aply stated by reducing the
 
02:34:41.670 --> 02:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
tolerance of what Society is willing to
 
02:34:45.389 --> 02:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
allow up to the point of limit Limitless
 
02:34:45.399 --> 02:34:47.230 align:start position:0%
allow up to the point of limit Limitless
reoffending

02:34:47.230 --> 02:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
reoffending
 
02:34:48.870 --> 02:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
which people will
 
02:34:51.830 --> 02:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
do if they have an underlying substance
 
02:34:54.590 --> 02:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
use disorder that drives them to the
 
02:35:00.510 --> 02:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:06.469 --> 02:35:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:10.670 --> 02:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
up turn my mic back on um
 
02:35:13.429 --> 02:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
so so it sounds like one of the things
 
02:35:16.110 --> 02:35:16.120 align:start position:0%
that you would support would be
 
02:35:21.790 --> 02:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
diversionary programs uh for people um
 
02:35:25.030 --> 02:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
who have substance abuse issues uh who
 
02:35:28.309 --> 02:35:28.319 align:start position:0%
were frequent offenders is that is that
 
02:35:31.230 --> 02:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
correct that that's correct uh diversion
 
02:35:33.190 --> 02:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
programs for those folks but it would be
 
02:35:36.269 --> 02:35:36.279 align:start position:0%
court ordered mandated and for certain
 
02:35:39.309 --> 02:35:39.319 align:start position:0%
people that continued to reoffend and
 
02:35:41.670 --> 02:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
not Avail themselves of treatment so in
 
02:35:43.790 --> 02:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
other words they have already presented
 
02:35:46.550 --> 02:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
a history of being told
 
02:35:48.550 --> 02:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
you've you've offended you have this
 
02:35:51.150 --> 02:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
underlying substance use disorder you've
 
02:35:54.349 --> 02:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
been ordered into treatment three four
 
02:35:58.030 --> 02:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
times you have not fulfilled that
 
02:36:01.710 --> 02:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
obligation so now the system criminal
 
02:36:03.429 --> 02:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
justice system is going to say you are
 
02:36:11.190 --> 02:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:13.950 --> 02:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
incarcerator that's the key
 
02:36:17.790 --> 02:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
element follow up
 
02:36:19.950 --> 02:36:19.960 align:start position:0%
so in terms of of actually implementing
 
02:36:22.309 --> 02:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
a system like that it it sounds like
 
02:36:24.510 --> 02:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
that's something that if we adopted it
 
02:36:27.670 --> 02:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh we might want any judge uh in New
 
02:36:32.269 --> 02:36:32.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be able to do um uh not
 
02:36:34.830 --> 02:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
just a judge in a drug court correct
 
02:36:36.870 --> 02:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
that would be any judge absolutely
 
02:36:39.710 --> 02:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
Because by the time these defendants
 
02:36:42.790 --> 02:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
reach drug court they have a massed
 
02:36:46.150 --> 02:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
trajectory and history of of fending and
 
02:36:49.670 --> 02:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
reoffending that is substantial much
 
02:36:52.349 --> 02:36:52.359 align:start position:0%
more than you know what we see here in
 
02:36:52.359 --> 02:36:53.990 align:start position:0%
more than you know what we see here in
these

02:36:53.990 --> 02:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:36:58.790 --> 02:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
numbers one more followup and and would
 
02:37:03.030 --> 02:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
and by and by judge I think I mean are
 
02:37:05.830 --> 02:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
we talking about just a judge so looking
 
02:37:08.110 --> 02:37:08.120 align:start position:0%
at you know some of our conversations
 
02:37:10.469 --> 02:37:10.479 align:start position:0%
around Bill Commissioners and folks like
 
02:37:13.150 --> 02:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
this should should a bail commissioner
 
02:37:16.030 --> 02:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
have the ability uh maybe this is
 
02:37:19.030 --> 02:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
something that appears on a check off so
 
02:37:21.510 --> 02:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
instead of a cash bail it could be
 
02:37:25.469 --> 02:37:25.479 align:start position:0%
participation in a program like this or
 
02:37:27.150 --> 02:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
would a bail commissioner even have
 
02:37:31.110 --> 02:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
knowledge that a person is a frequent
 
02:37:33.590 --> 02:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
offender the bail Commissioners don't
 
02:37:35.710 --> 02:37:35.720 align:start position:0%
have the knowledge or the ability to be
 
02:37:39.630 --> 02:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
able to make those kinds of decisions um
 
02:37:42.469 --> 02:37:42.479 align:start position:0%
the the bail Commissioners uh uh that
 
02:37:45.309 --> 02:37:45.319 align:start position:0%
make uh the right decisions uh across
 
02:37:46.389 --> 02:37:46.399 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:37:48.510 --> 02:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
um are the ones that we don't hear about
 
02:37:51.070 --> 02:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
and the cases that we don't hear about
 
02:37:53.510 --> 02:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
um the bail Commissioners that make what
 
02:37:57.670 --> 02:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
we considered to be um less than optimal
 
02:38:00.070 --> 02:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
decisions with respect to releasing
 
02:38:03.389 --> 02:38:03.399 align:start position:0%
folks that have committed allegedly
 
02:38:06.190 --> 02:38:06.200 align:start position:0%
committed a violent crime uh are the
 
02:38:09.389 --> 02:38:09.399 align:start position:0%
ones that um I think that we we talk
 
02:38:13.110 --> 02:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
about and so what we're really looking
 
02:38:16.389 --> 02:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
at here is designing a system
 
02:38:21.790 --> 02:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
that provides a bit more um Direction a
 
02:38:24.870 --> 02:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
bit less discretion bit less not a lot
 
02:38:27.590 --> 02:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
less but a bit less discretion that
 
02:38:31.990 --> 02:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
allows the courts and um the system to
 
02:38:35.269 --> 02:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
be able to be more effective in dealing
 
02:38:39.830 --> 02:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
with folks that um are presented in
 
02:38:42.790 --> 02:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
basically two categories those that can
 
02:38:44.550 --> 02:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
are alleged to have committed violent
 
02:38:47.469 --> 02:38:47.479 align:start position:0%
crime and those those that uh are
 
02:38:50.389 --> 02:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
reflected in these numbers the 9% that
 
02:38:51.590 --> 02:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
account for
 
02:38:55.510 --> 02:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
34% um which are those that continually
 
02:38:58.790 --> 02:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
reoffend the vast majority of those with
 
02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
a substance use
 
02:39:05.269 --> 02:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
disorder Chief if I if I could um so I
 
02:39:07.349 --> 02:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
don't think you'd find much disagreement
 
02:39:09.030 --> 02:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
on this committee that that those things
 
02:39:11.469 --> 02:39:11.479 align:start position:0%
are necessary um with regard to the
 
02:39:15.830 --> 02:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
treatment offer amps but were it to be
 
02:39:18.110 --> 02:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
law at this minute in a judge were to
 
02:39:21.429 --> 02:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
say okay you are going to this mandatory
 
02:39:21.439 --> 02:39:22.990 align:start position:0%
say okay you are going to this mandatory
um

02:39:22.990 --> 02:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:25.630 --> 02:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
service are there such places do we have
 
02:39:27.870 --> 02:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
this set up I mean how far out are we
 
02:39:30.030 --> 02:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
looking before we could even Implement
 
02:39:33.590 --> 02:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
such a system where these folks could go
 
02:39:35.510 --> 02:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
some of these programs currently exist
 
02:39:38.030 --> 02:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
in some counties uh I know that the
 
02:39:41.630 --> 02:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
superintendent in Hillsboro County uh is
 
02:39:43.870 --> 02:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
seeking to establish uh medically
 
02:39:46.990 --> 02:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
assisted incarcerated treatment program
 
02:39:50.790 --> 02:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh in Hillsboro County um and so I would
 
02:39:53.469 --> 02:39:53.479 align:start position:0%
hope that there would be leadership um
 
02:39:56.910 --> 02:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
at the state level uh within the courts
 
02:40:01.190 --> 02:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
um uh and others to make sure that this
 
02:40:03.870 --> 02:40:03.880 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement money uh or at least a
 
02:40:07.950 --> 02:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
portion of it is being uh devoted to
 
02:40:10.950 --> 02:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
standing up uh what appears to be very
 
02:40:13.190 --> 02:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
effective treatment programs in in the
 
02:40:15.150 --> 02:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
county jails that has to be in place the
 
02:40:18.670 --> 02:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
judges will not sentence someone to a
 
02:40:21.190 --> 02:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
program that doesn't exist and that's
 
02:40:23.389 --> 02:40:23.399 align:start position:0%
been and that's frankly been one of the
 
02:40:26.070 --> 02:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
problems right uh the judges do have
 
02:40:29.590 --> 02:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
folks before them um but if there's no
 
02:40:32.590 --> 02:40:32.600 align:start position:0%
incarcerated treatment program available
 
02:40:34.630 --> 02:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
then often times those folks are
 
02:40:37.429 --> 02:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
sentenced um to a term U of
 
02:40:39.110 --> 02:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
incarceration all
 
02:40:41.150 --> 02:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
suspended uh and then told to get
 
02:40:44.309 --> 02:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
treatment outside the system which they
 
02:40:47.389 --> 02:40:47.399 align:start position:0%
typically don't do
 
02:40:50.269 --> 02:40:50.279 align:start position:0%
with regard to mental health again it
 
02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
goes back to available beds I know we
 
02:40:53.870 --> 02:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
just completed a facility but
 
02:40:55.710 --> 02:40:55.720 align:start position:0%
disappointingly I think it ended up with
 
02:40:58.510 --> 02:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
like a handful of beds um versus the
 
02:41:01.269 --> 02:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
hundreds we would need are you aware of
 
02:41:03.870 --> 02:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
anywhere um that are not government
 
02:41:06.429 --> 02:41:06.439 align:start position:0%
ordered or run that these folks could be
 
02:41:08.510 --> 02:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
sent to to get back on their meds and
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
treatment and things of that
 
02:41:12.710 --> 02:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
nature that is probably one of the
 
02:41:15.110 --> 02:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
largest gaps that we Face here in the
 
02:41:16.910 --> 02:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
state New Hampshire and I don't think
 
02:41:18.790 --> 02:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is different than most
 
02:41:21.630 --> 02:41:21.640 align:start position:0%
other states the mental health Gap in
 
02:41:24.830 --> 02:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
terms of facilities um and the ability
 
02:41:27.990 --> 02:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
02:41:32.150 --> 02:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
um treat as well as provide services to
 
02:41:35.590 --> 02:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
folks who have um a mental health
 
02:41:38.950 --> 02:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
diagnosis uh and to follow them through
 
02:41:41.870 --> 02:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
um is is largely non-existent and I
 
02:41:44.750 --> 02:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
think that again the study points out
 
02:41:46.230 --> 02:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
the wide
 
02:41:48.630 --> 02:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
um U
 
02:41:51.230 --> 02:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
differentiation um Divergence between
 
02:41:54.710 --> 02:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
the existence of pre-trial Services uh
 
02:41:58.469 --> 02:41:58.479 align:start position:0%
throughout the state uh that mechanism
 
02:42:02.590 --> 02:42:02.600 align:start position:0%
could uh provide some degree of a stop
 
02:42:05.469 --> 02:42:05.479 align:start position:0%
Gap measure as I think you're indicating
 
02:42:08.469 --> 02:42:08.479 align:start position:0%
here to help along with the system um
 
02:42:10.790 --> 02:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
for those that um suffer with a mental
 
02:42:14.349 --> 02:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:14.359 --> 02:42:18.349 align:start position:0%
 
disorder

02:42:18.349 --> 02:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:19.830 --> 02:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony we appr
 
02:42:20.710 --> 02:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
02:42:24.670 --> 02:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
much oh
 
02:42:26.349 --> 02:42:26.359 align:start position:0%
representative I'm not on the
 
02:42:29.110 --> 02:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but they're nice to me so
 
02:42:32.550 --> 02:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh the I can't disagree of course with
 
02:42:34.349 --> 02:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
the dialogue that you and representative
 
02:42:36.750 --> 02:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
news had but one thing that has caught
 
02:42:39.990 --> 02:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
my attention is can somebody be forced
 
02:42:43.269 --> 02:42:43.279 align:start position:0%
into a program we can incarcerate them
 
02:42:45.710 --> 02:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
but you what are you going to have just
 
02:42:47.790 --> 02:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
because you're well-intentioned and it's
 
02:42:50.590 --> 02:42:50.600 align:start position:0%
effective will they cooperate and just
 
02:42:52.910 --> 02:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
some people won't what do you do can
 
02:42:55.510 --> 02:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
they be my question is can they be
 
02:42:59.550 --> 02:42:59.560 align:start position:0%
forced into a program even post
 
02:43:01.309 --> 02:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
conviction well thank you for your
 
02:43:04.030 --> 02:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
question and I I I I think that what we
 
02:43:07.670 --> 02:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
see uh in the numbers is that when an
 
02:43:09.469 --> 02:43:09.479 align:start position:0%
individual is
 
02:43:13.630 --> 02:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
released uh under bail conditions um
 
02:43:16.150 --> 02:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
some of which require the individual to
 
02:43:19.349 --> 02:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
seek substance use disorder treatment we
 
02:43:22.469 --> 02:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
find that uh significant in fact a
 
02:43:25.750 --> 02:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
majority of those folks don't seek that
 
02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
treatment um the system the the courts
 
02:43:34.030 --> 02:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
can mandate them participate in much
 
02:43:36.349 --> 02:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
like the system that is currently in the
 
02:43:39.150 --> 02:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
mainstate prison a medically assisted
 
02:43:41.150 --> 02:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
treatment program now again it's not
 
02:43:44.230 --> 02:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
100% effective but it can force the
 
02:43:46.990 --> 02:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
individual to be in the program whether
 
02:43:56.469 --> 02:43:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:00.710 --> 02:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
them thank thank you so
 
02:44:03.710 --> 02:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
much I believe last but not least I'm
 
02:44:07.230 --> 02:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
going to give um Professor Sher u 10
 
02:44:11.349 --> 02:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
minutes of our time before we go as you
 
02:44:14.190 --> 02:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
requested I had to put a limit on
 
02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:17.150 align:start position:0%
requested I had to put a limit on
you

02:44:17.150 --> 02:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:44:18.710 --> 02:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's a good limit because I have to be
 
02:44:21.309 --> 02:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
at school at one
 
02:44:21.319 --> 02:44:25.630 align:start position:0%
at school at one
o'clock

02:44:25.630 --> 02:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:28.269 --> 02:44:28.279 align:start position:0%
um I agree with a lot of what's been
 
02:44:28.279 --> 02:44:29.230 align:start position:0%
um I agree with a lot of what's been
said

02:44:29.230 --> 02:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:44:29.240 --> 02:44:30.950 align:start position:0%
said
today

02:44:30.950 --> 02:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:44:34.590 --> 02:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
um with one exception um you I've known
 
02:44:36.870 --> 02:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
County attorney hathway for over 40
 
02:44:40.269 --> 02:44:40.279 align:start position:0%
years now sad commentary on both of our
 
02:44:43.950 --> 02:44:43.960 align:start position:0%
ages um and he's wrong that there are
 
02:44:46.070 --> 02:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
not there there are not mechanisms in
 
02:44:48.510 --> 02:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
the current bail statute to deal with
 
02:44:51.070 --> 02:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
people who fail to appear repeatedly to
 
02:44:53.309 --> 02:44:53.319 align:start position:0%
deal with people who are violating bail
 
02:44:57.389 --> 02:44:57.399 align:start position:0%
conditions they are there and uh I think
 
02:44:59.590 --> 02:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
this committee is sophisticated enough
 
02:45:02.389 --> 02:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
at this point and in uh looking at the
 
02:45:04.349 --> 02:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
statute to know that they are there I
 
02:45:08.910 --> 02:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
will pass out uh to the committee um uh
 
02:45:12.190 --> 02:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
uh a copy of
 
02:45:15.910 --> 02:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
5972 with three areas highlight
 
02:45:17.670 --> 02:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
that deal with that
 
02:45:21.550 --> 02:45:21.560 align:start position:0%
circumstance um because and I'll do it
 
02:45:23.710 --> 02:45:23.720 align:start position:0%
I'll do it after I finish testifying
 
02:45:26.950 --> 02:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
because it's there and so I don't think
 
02:45:29.550 --> 02:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
the problem is the statute you know
 
02:45:31.590 --> 02:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
you've heard this from me several times
 
02:45:33.910 --> 02:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
the problem isn't the statute the
 
02:45:37.510 --> 02:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
problem is implementation you know be it
 
02:45:39.429 --> 02:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
educating judges be it educating bail
 
02:45:41.750 --> 02:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that's the
 
02:45:45.510 --> 02:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
problem uh part two I agreed medically
 
02:45:48.030 --> 02:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
assisted treatment while incarcerated
 
02:45:52.030 --> 02:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
can be effective but uh it's when people
 
02:45:55.550 --> 02:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
are sentenced it it
 
02:45:57.990 --> 02:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
is very
 
02:46:00.429 --> 02:46:00.439 align:start position:0%
difficult well I'm put it a different
 
02:46:04.510 --> 02:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
way the best way to deal with those with
 
02:46:06.870 --> 02:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
possible substance abuse problems or
 
02:46:09.950 --> 02:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
mental health problems is to use that
 
02:46:13.269 --> 02:46:13.279 align:start position:0%
opioid money for pre-trial services in
 
02:46:16.910 --> 02:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
every County because if you don't do
 
02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
that you're leaving it to judges to
 
02:46:22.230 --> 02:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
diagnose whether somebody has a mental
 
02:46:24.590 --> 02:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
health issue diagnose whether they have
 
02:46:27.269 --> 02:46:27.279 align:start position:0%
a substance abuse issue and they're not
 
02:46:32.030 --> 02:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
good at that um and you know we don't
 
02:46:36.190 --> 02:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
want that system so yeah I I think uh
 
02:46:38.790 --> 02:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
potentially uh if we have a pre-trial
 
02:46:42.110 --> 02:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
service system in every County where
 
02:46:44.710 --> 02:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
professionals can do that diagnostic
 
02:46:47.910 --> 02:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
Behavior Behavior then we start to have
 
02:46:51.830 --> 02:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh a a a bail system that works remember
 
02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about people who are
 
02:46:56.710 --> 02:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
sentenced and and my belief is I haven't
 
02:46:58.630 --> 02:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
read the report but my belief is the
 
02:47:02.590 --> 02:47:02.600 align:start position:0%
numbers the chief t uh talk to us about
 
02:47:04.790 --> 02:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
primarily covers people who have already
 
02:47:06.710 --> 02:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
been sentenced that really aren't
 
02:47:10.110 --> 02:47:10.120 align:start position:0%
talking about pre-trial people um and
 
02:47:12.590 --> 02:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
you and those numbers are no surprise
 
02:47:15.429 --> 02:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
whatsoever um you know but I think we're
 
02:47:17.349 --> 02:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
not talking about pre-trial people the
 
02:47:19.230 --> 02:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
repeat offenders that keep cycling
 
02:47:21.269 --> 02:47:21.279 align:start position:0%
through the jail are cycling through the
 
02:47:22.670 --> 02:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
jail on
 
02:47:29.150 --> 02:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
sentences um so um I'm going to my list
 
02:47:31.870 --> 02:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
um you've heard this again for me but
 
02:47:31.880 --> 02:47:33.150 align:start position:0%
um you've heard this again for me but
you

02:47:33.150 --> 02:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:47:37.110 --> 02:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
know bail Commissioners have by Statute
 
02:47:40.750 --> 02:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
have all the authority that judges have
 
02:47:43.469 --> 02:47:43.479 align:start position:0%
as to bail they
 
02:47:47.190 --> 02:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
do um so so any sense that the bail
 
02:47:48.830 --> 02:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioners really don't have the
 
02:47:51.630 --> 02:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
power to do X Y or Z is not the
 
02:47:51.640 --> 02:47:53.150 align:start position:0%
power to do X Y or Z is not the
case

02:47:53.150 --> 02:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:47:58.309 --> 02:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
um I would uh I would suggest that
 
02:48:02.110 --> 02:48:02.120 align:start position:0%
um police begin to consider uh given
 
02:48:03.590 --> 02:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
their concern that they don't have
 
02:48:05.349 --> 02:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
enough information about an individual
 
02:48:07.630 --> 02:48:07.640 align:start position:0%
to make a good to really provide all the
 
02:48:08.950 --> 02:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
necessary information to bail
 
02:48:11.429 --> 02:48:11.439 align:start position:0%
Commissioners or even judges well for
 
02:48:13.110 --> 02:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
those people who are not immediately
 
02:48:14.910 --> 02:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
dangerous and they need to get off the
 
02:48:14.920 --> 02:48:16.309 align:start position:0%
dangerous and they need to get off the
Street

02:48:16.309 --> 02:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
Street
 
02:48:19.110 --> 02:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
instantly instead of arresting people as
 
02:48:22.190 --> 02:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
soon as they can maybe take an extra day
 
02:48:26.150 --> 02:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
to do gather bail facts to see to run a
 
02:48:28.309 --> 02:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
prior record to see me how many failures
 
02:48:31.070 --> 02:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
to appear this person has to find out
 
02:48:33.110 --> 02:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
more about this purpose person for
 
02:48:36.110 --> 02:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
making a bail argument rather than
 
02:48:39.910 --> 02:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
arresting them as quick as they can um
 
02:48:42.710 --> 02:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
and not having all the information that
 
02:48:45.110 --> 02:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
would allow them to make an effective
 
02:48:46.830 --> 02:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
argument to the bail commissioner or a
 
02:48:50.070 --> 02:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
prosecutor to a judge you know no
 
02:48:51.510 --> 02:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
question there's some crimes they have
 
02:48:53.710 --> 02:48:53.720 align:start position:0%
to arrest them immediately for but I I
 
02:48:55.950 --> 02:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
think that's a proposition worth
 
02:48:59.510 --> 02:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
considering um you know I disagree uh
 
02:49:03.030 --> 02:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
with the interpretation of the um uh
 
02:49:05.269 --> 02:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
that attorney County attorney Hathaway
 
02:49:07.510 --> 02:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
did of the uh clearing convincing
 
02:49:10.790 --> 02:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
standard you know the fergal case uh
 
02:49:13.630 --> 02:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
which was referred to in uh in that CA
 
02:49:16.389 --> 02:49:16.399 align:start position:0%
in the case he mentioned whose name I I
 
02:49:17.590 --> 02:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
not even going to try and pronounce that
 
02:49:21.030 --> 02:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
begins with z um the fergal decision was
 
02:49:23.990 --> 02:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
a pre uh the clar and convincing
 
02:49:26.630 --> 02:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
standard didn't exist in New Hampshire
 
02:49:29.030 --> 02:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
back uh other than in homicide cases
 
02:49:32.990 --> 02:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
other uh except back in in 2010 when
 
02:49:34.389 --> 02:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
feral was
 
02:49:40.429 --> 02:49:40.439 align:start position:0%
decided um so um I point that out um I
 
02:49:44.469 --> 02:49:44.479 align:start position:0%
think I'm almost done uh there is a lot
 
02:49:48.550 --> 02:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
of data and the court has this data that
 
02:49:51.750 --> 02:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh a texting system for reminding people
 
02:49:53.950 --> 02:49:53.960 align:start position:0%
that they've got a court date coming up
 
02:49:56.110 --> 02:49:56.120 align:start position:0%
has been shown to be very effective in
 
02:49:57.990 --> 02:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
various uh circumstances I think there's
 
02:50:00.469 --> 02:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
a great study out of Pittsburgh uh the
 
02:50:02.910 --> 02:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
city of Pittsburgh if I'm not mistaken
 
02:50:05.630 --> 02:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh the the the court system the district
 
02:50:09.070 --> 02:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
court system several years ago uh set up
 
02:50:11.229 --> 02:50:11.239 align:start position:0%
a pilot program in Rochester District
 
02:50:12.630 --> 02:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
Court to do
 
02:50:16.389 --> 02:50:16.399 align:start position:0%
that and then the the pmic head uh and
 
02:50:18.510 --> 02:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
it it it didn't make any sense at that
 
02:50:21.830 --> 02:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
point for all sorts of reasons so the
 
02:50:25.550 --> 02:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
court had set up a a test of that
 
02:50:28.309 --> 02:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
texting system uh and I think it's worth
 
02:50:35.670 --> 02:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:39.349 --> 02:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
know uh I think I'm almost done uh one
 
02:50:39.359 --> 02:50:41.190 align:start position:0%
know uh I think I'm almost done uh one
last

02:50:41.190 --> 02:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
last
 
02:50:47.190 --> 02:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
thing I think uh attorney Halon attorney
 
02:50:50.389 --> 02:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
Enders correctly said when
 
02:50:53.309 --> 02:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
asked the majority of people out on PR
 
02:50:56.870 --> 02:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
Bale are not a problem I think let's
 
02:50:58.630 --> 02:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
keep in
 
02:51:01.710 --> 02:51:01.720 align:start position:0%
perspective the nature of the problem
 
02:51:05.229 --> 02:51:05.239 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with the huge majority I
 
02:51:07.349 --> 02:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
believe of people who are out on PR bail
 
02:51:09.429 --> 02:51:09.439 align:start position:0%
are not a problem we're talking about a
 
02:51:12.630 --> 02:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
small group and we're talking about a
 
02:51:15.150 --> 02:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
small group for whom bail Commission and
 
02:51:17.349 --> 02:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
judges have the authority under the
 
02:51:19.630 --> 02:51:19.640 align:start position:0%
statute to deal with the
 
02:51:23.429 --> 02:51:23.439 align:start position:0%
circumstance um and for whatever reason
 
02:51:24.870 --> 02:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
you know we've had discussions in
 
02:51:27.670 --> 02:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
various ways about this the baale
 
02:51:30.229 --> 02:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
statute hasn't been used to do that just
 
02:51:33.429 --> 02:51:33.439 align:start position:0%
one last example if you look
 
02:51:33.439 --> 02:51:35.469 align:start position:0%
one last example if you look
at

02:51:35.469 --> 02:51:35.479 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:51:40.630 --> 02:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
um uh where is it ah uh the bail statute
 
02:51:42.349 --> 02:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral
 
02:51:45.670 --> 02:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
3 uh when in the provision that talks
 
02:51:48.510 --> 02:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
about ass assuring the court appearance
 
02:51:49.950 --> 02:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
of charged
 
02:51:53.750 --> 02:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
persons paragraph two says if the court
 
02:51:55.750 --> 02:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
determines by preponderance of evidence
 
02:51:58.030 --> 02:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
that a person has failed to appear on
 
02:52:00.510 --> 02:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
any previous matter charged as a felony
 
02:52:03.030 --> 02:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
Class A misdemeanor or DWI or reasonably
 
02:52:04.830 --> 02:52:04.840 align:start position:0%
equivalent offense in an out of state
 
02:52:06.910 --> 02:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction three or more times in the
 
02:52:11.510 --> 02:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
past five years or twice on the present
 
02:52:13.790 --> 02:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
case there shall be a rebuttable
 
02:52:16.469 --> 02:52:16.479 align:start position:0%
presumption that re release will not
 
02:52:18.590 --> 02:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
reasonably assure the appearance of the
 
02:52:22.110 --> 02:52:22.120 align:start position:0%
person as required so two failures to
 
02:52:25.030 --> 02:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
appear on a on the present case and the
 
02:52:27.469 --> 02:52:27.479 align:start position:0%
Court's got all a lot of authority to
 
02:52:31.349 --> 02:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
deal with that again an example
 
02:52:34.429 --> 02:52:34.439 align:start position:0%
of we don't need to work the bail
 
02:52:37.630 --> 02:52:37.640 align:start position:0%
statute over significantly because it's
 
02:52:40.830 --> 02:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
already there there's some other Pro
 
02:52:44.429 --> 02:52:44.439 align:start position:0%
systemic problem in be it education or
 
02:52:47.190 --> 02:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
or whatever be an education of
 
02:52:49.910 --> 02:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
prosecutors of judges of bail
 
02:52:54.229 --> 02:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that's the issue um and
 
02:52:57.870 --> 02:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
last I'll repeat pre-trial uh pre-trial
 
02:53:01.110 --> 02:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
services in every County would make a
 
02:53:01.120 --> 02:53:09.030 align:start position:0%
services in every County would make a
huge

02:53:09.030 --> 02:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:13.349 --> 02:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:13.359 --> 02:53:15.910 align:start position:0%
 
out

02:53:15.910 --> 02:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:53:18.990 --> 02:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
almost got sorry about that um in the
 
02:53:21.870 --> 02:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
current statute um one of the things
 
02:53:23.710 --> 02:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
that it does say is and you took us
 
02:53:25.030 --> 02:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
through part of this if the court
 
02:53:26.750 --> 02:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
determines by a preponderance of the
 
02:53:28.750 --> 02:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
evidence that a person has failed to
 
02:53:31.030 --> 02:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
appear on any previous matter charged as
 
02:53:35.389 --> 02:53:35.399 align:start position:0%
a felony Class A misdemeanor DWI or
 
02:53:37.150 --> 02:53:37.160 align:start position:0%
reasonably equivalent offense in an
 
02:53:40.070 --> 02:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
outof State jurisdiction then it lays
 
02:53:43.190 --> 02:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
out um you know three or more times
 
02:53:45.030 --> 02:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
within the past 5 years years or twice
 
02:53:47.389 --> 02:53:47.399 align:start position:0%
on the present case there should be a
 
02:53:49.429 --> 02:53:49.439 align:start position:0%
rebuttable assumption that the release
 
02:53:51.550 --> 02:53:51.560 align:start position:0%
will not reasonably assure the
 
02:53:55.349 --> 02:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
appearance of the person is required So
 
02:53:58.389 --> 02:53:58.399 align:start position:0%
currently we're talking about felonies
 
02:54:01.070 --> 02:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
Class A misdemeanors driving while
 
02:54:03.510 --> 02:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
impaired other offenses a lot of the
 
02:54:05.630 --> 02:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
offenses that we're talking about though
 
02:54:07.229 --> 02:54:07.239 align:start position:0%
you know by the people who have regular
 
02:54:09.510 --> 02:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
encounters with the court system would
 
02:54:13.110 --> 02:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
not fall into that category uh I think
 
02:54:16.269 --> 02:54:16.279 align:start position:0%
the ones we worry most about W uh you
 
02:54:17.510 --> 02:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
know there are
 
02:54:20.550 --> 02:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
violations uh that and Class B
 
02:54:23.190 --> 02:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor that account for some of
 
02:54:26.990 --> 02:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
those the problem there is uh of a
 
02:54:29.429 --> 02:54:29.439 align:start position:0%
different order a different policy
 
02:54:32.630 --> 02:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
question neither violations nor Class B
 
02:54:34.510 --> 02:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors even if you're convicted
 
02:54:36.590 --> 02:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get a jail sentence
 
02:54:39.790 --> 02:54:39.800 align:start position:0%
right so to hold somebody pre-trial on a
 
02:54:42.670 --> 02:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
charge for which assuming they have
 
02:54:44.830 --> 02:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
multiple failures to appear that they're
 
02:54:46.510 --> 02:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
not going to get a jail sentence with
 
02:54:48.550 --> 02:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
that's a that's
 
02:54:52.469 --> 02:54:52.479 align:start position:0%
a difficult thing uh arguably should
 
02:54:55.790 --> 02:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
never be happening um but uh you know
 
02:54:58.510 --> 02:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
that that that raises a question though
 
02:55:02.910 --> 02:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
is is contempt of court jailable yes so
 
02:55:04.790 --> 02:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
failure to appear theoretically could be
 
02:55:07.389 --> 02:55:07.399 align:start position:0%
charged as contempt of court it it could
 
02:55:11.349 --> 02:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
be charged with contempt of court uh and
 
02:55:17.790 --> 02:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:22.349 --> 02:55:22.359 align:start position:0%
I I don't you know one needs to judgment
 
02:55:24.309 --> 02:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
needs to be used as to whether if
 
02:55:27.710 --> 02:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
someone is committing repeat violations
 
02:55:31.429 --> 02:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
like littering we ever want to you know
 
02:55:33.309 --> 02:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
uh put them in jail for any period of
 
02:55:33.319 --> 02:55:43.190 align:start position:0%
uh put them in jail for any period of
time

02:55:43.190 --> 02:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:47.269 align:start position:0%
 
whatsoever

02:55:47.269 --> 02:55:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:47.279 --> 02:55:56.510 align:start position:0%
 
who

02:55:56.510 --> 02:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:59.309 --> 02:55:59.319 align:start position:0%
is Paul how from County again I asked
 
02:56:00.590 --> 02:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
attorney endress to come up with me
 
02:56:02.870 --> 02:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
because he actually did the litigation
 
02:56:04.750 --> 02:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
on the issue I'm about to raise point
 
02:56:07.990 --> 02:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
out the chief pointed out um the issue
 
02:56:13.670 --> 02:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
of tree Tri um court ordered mandated uh
 
02:56:17.389 --> 02:56:17.399 align:start position:0%
treatment for um addiction issues uh and
 
02:56:19.389 --> 02:56:19.399 align:start position:0%
I tie this into the Bale statute because
 
02:56:21.229 --> 02:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
there's a direct reference in this title
 
02:56:23.510 --> 02:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
I'm about to tell you under
 
02:56:26.070 --> 02:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
17213 which is under the New Hampshire
 
02:56:29.590 --> 02:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
substitute disorder system statute um
 
02:56:33.550 --> 02:56:33.560 align:start position:0%
there is a mechanism for the courts to
 
02:56:35.349 --> 02:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh refer an individual to Health and
 
02:56:37.429 --> 02:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
Human Services for evaluation and
 
02:56:40.790 --> 02:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
recommended treatment um we tried to do
 
02:56:43.590 --> 02:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
that in a recent case uh individual was
 
02:56:46.349 --> 02:56:46.359 align:start position:0%
clearly a substance abuse user uh the
 
02:56:48.190 --> 02:56:48.200 align:start position:0%
judge even commented from the bench that
 
02:56:52.990 --> 02:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
it was clear um yet uh for some reason
 
02:56:55.190 --> 02:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh the court declined to make that
 
02:56:57.070 --> 02:56:57.080 align:start position:0%
referral over to Health and Human
 
02:56:59.510 --> 02:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
Services um without going into details
 
02:57:01.190 --> 02:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
of that specific
 
02:57:04.710 --> 02:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
case the part
 
02:57:09.710 --> 02:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
of 17213 that ties into bail is that if
 
02:57:11.830 --> 02:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
the person is made that referral goes
 
02:57:14.030 --> 02:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
into the treatment the court May Rel
 
02:57:15.510 --> 02:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
leas the person conditionally for
 
02:57:17.630 --> 02:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
treatment at any alcohol drug abuse
 
02:57:19.469 --> 02:57:19.479 align:start position:0%
Clinic certified facility mental health
 
02:57:21.750 --> 02:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
clinic or Center or other appropriate
 
02:57:24.030 --> 02:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
sources of care so there's already a
 
02:57:26.269 --> 02:57:26.279 align:start position:0%
mechanism for individuals who have a
 
02:57:29.630 --> 02:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
demonstrated substance abuse uh issue to
 
02:57:31.990 --> 02:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
be released pre-trial even if they're
 
02:57:34.590 --> 02:57:34.600 align:start position:0%
being detained for substance abuse
 
02:57:37.150 --> 02:57:37.160 align:start position:0%
treatment uh now the difficulty and I'll
 
02:57:38.710 --> 02:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
defer to attorney Anders to elaborate on
 
02:57:39.710 --> 02:57:39.720 align:start position:0%
this because he had the actual
 
02:57:42.110 --> 02:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
discussions with HHS it's my
 
02:57:44.190 --> 02:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
understanding that HHS has no has no
 
02:57:45.910 --> 02:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
internal process to process that
 
02:57:48.550 --> 02:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
individual if the court makes a referral
 
02:57:52.469 --> 02:57:52.479 align:start position:0%
um and uh I I see that as uh a real
 
02:57:55.269 --> 02:57:55.279 align:start position:0%
stopping point um it's an Avenue that's
 
02:57:57.269 --> 02:57:57.279 align:start position:0%
available but it's one that's not
 
02:57:59.550 --> 02:57:59.560 align:start position:0%
executable it's available by Statute but
 
02:58:03.510 --> 02:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
not executable by uh by the uh by the
 
02:58:05.269 --> 02:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
organization um I don't know if attorney
 
02:58:06.790 --> 02:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
Enders wants to elaborate a little on
 
02:58:08.550 --> 02:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
that and by that you mean no drug
 
02:58:10.870 --> 02:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
screening no ability to conduct drug
 
02:58:13.429 --> 02:58:13.439 align:start position:0%
screening that type of thing the the
 
02:58:16.429 --> 02:58:16.439 align:start position:0%
statute self and again this is
 
02:58:20.110 --> 02:58:20.120 align:start position:0%
17213 paragraph 2 actually says when a
 
02:58:22.070 --> 02:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
person is indicted for a felony or is
 
02:58:23.790 --> 02:58:23.800 align:start position:0%
awaiting the action of the grand jury on
 
02:58:25.389 --> 02:58:25.399 align:start position:0%
any felony or is charged with a
 
02:58:28.070 --> 02:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and question as to the drug
 
02:58:29.990 --> 02:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
or alcohol dependency of the person is
 
02:58:32.950 --> 02:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
raised by either party any justice of
 
02:58:34.790 --> 02:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
the Superior or Circuit Court having
 
02:58:37.110 --> 02:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the matter May after
 
02:58:39.630 --> 02:58:39.640 align:start position:0%
hearing order such person to be examined
 
02:58:41.030 --> 02:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
in accordance with the instructions of
 
02:58:43.349 --> 02:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
the commissioner to determine whether
 
02:58:45.309 --> 02:58:45.319 align:start position:0%
said person is drug or alcohol dependent
 
02:58:46.550 --> 02:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
the commissioner shall report the
 
02:58:48.469 --> 02:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
results of the examination and his
 
02:58:50.190 --> 02:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
findings to the court and writing and
 
02:58:51.630 --> 02:58:51.640 align:start position:0%
the commissioner there's the
 
02:58:53.030 --> 02:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner of
 
02:58:55.870 --> 02:58:55.880 align:start position:0%
DHHS the the next paragraph paragraph
 
02:58:58.429 --> 02:58:58.439 align:start position:0%
three reads if a person examined
 
02:59:00.190 --> 02:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the provisions of paragraph
 
02:59:01.710 --> 02:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
2 is found to be drug or alcohol
 
02:59:03.790 --> 02:59:03.800 align:start position:0%
dependent the Superior Court having
 
02:59:05.309 --> 02:59:05.319 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the criminal action
 
02:59:08.030 --> 02:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
May after hearing without regard to the
 
02:59:10.269 --> 02:59:10.279 align:start position:0%
result of the Criminal action issue an
 
02:59:11.950 --> 02:59:11.960 align:start position:0%
order requiring the person to accept
 
02:59:13.870 --> 02:59:13.880 align:start position:0%
treatment at a certified substance abuse
 
02:59:15.750 --> 02:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
treatment facility when an opening
 
02:59:18.229 --> 02:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
becomes available during treatment no
 
02:59:19.910 --> 02:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
further action shall be taken in respect
 
02:59:21.630 --> 02:59:21.640 align:start position:0%
to the original charges made against
 
02:59:23.830 --> 02:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
such person unless otherwise ordered by
 
02:59:25.870 --> 02:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
the court the court May release the
 
02:59:27.469 --> 02:59:27.479 align:start position:0%
person conditionally for treatment at
 
02:59:29.590 --> 02:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
any alcohol drug abuse Clinic certified
 
02:59:31.670 --> 02:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
facility mental health clinic or Center
 
02:59:35.150 --> 02:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
or other appropriate sources of care um
 
02:59:38.590 --> 02:59:38.600 align:start position:0%
I had as attorney Halon said filed
 
02:59:40.790 --> 02:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
asking that someone be evaluated and
 
02:59:43.950 --> 02:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
called DHHS and said is there anything
 
02:59:45.830 --> 02:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
I'm supposed to put in this order and
 
02:59:47.590 --> 02:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
they essentially told me we don't do
 
02:59:51.309 --> 02:59:51.319 align:start position:0%
this um I explained well the statute
 
02:59:54.030 --> 02:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
might think differently and they told me
 
02:59:55.710 --> 02:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
I was reading the statute wrong and I
 
02:59:57.550 --> 02:59:57.560 align:start position:0%
said you know you might want to take a
 
02:59:59.550 --> 02:59:59.560 align:start position:0%
look at it and they're like oh it does
 
03:00:01.710 --> 03:00:01.720 align:start position:0%
say that but we don't have a process in
 
03:00:04.469 --> 03:00:04.479 align:start position:0%
place for this
 
03:00:04.479 --> 03:00:06.429 align:start position:0%
place for this
so

03:00:06.429 --> 03:00:06.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:00:09.750 --> 03:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
again the statute exists that allows you
 
03:00:12.630 --> 03:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
to essentially pause a criminal case and
 
03:00:15.429 --> 03:00:15.439 align:start position:0%
order a defendant into substance abuse
 
03:00:19.150 --> 03:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
treatment through DHHS whether in
 
03:00:21.870 --> 03:00:21.880 align:start position:0%
reality you can do that or not is I
 
03:00:24.150 --> 03:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
think a different question the role of
 
03:00:26.790 --> 03:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
DHHS would be simply to screen and and
 
03:00:29.070 --> 03:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
tell the court whether the person indeed
 
03:00:30.750 --> 03:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
did suffer from a legitimate mental
 
03:00:33.710 --> 03:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
health or so they could theoretically
 
03:00:35.070 --> 03:00:35.080 align:start position:0%
easily farm that out they don't
 
03:00:36.990 --> 03:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to build a an
 
03:00:38.990 --> 03:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure of their own to do it is
 
03:00:42.710 --> 03:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
that not the case or at least sound
 
03:00:42.720 --> 03:00:45.550 align:start position:0%
that not the case or at least sound
reasonable

03:00:45.550 --> 03:00:45.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
03:00:47.269 --> 03:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
it certainly strikes me that the statute
 
03:00:50.070 --> 03:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
anticipates the commissioner ordering
 
03:00:52.510 --> 03:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
this person to be evaluated and then the
 
03:00:54.110 --> 03:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner reporting back to the court
 
03:00:57.190 --> 03:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
on the results of that evaluation yeah
 
03:01:00.950 --> 03:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
um how long ago did you encounter this
 
03:01:04.429 --> 03:01:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:09.070 --> 03:01:09.080 align:start position:0%
months and uh the difficulty is I was
 
03:01:11.670 --> 03:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
told we might be able to we would tell
 
03:01:14.469 --> 03:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
the person to get an appointment
 
03:01:16.990 --> 03:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
and I explained we might be dealing with
 
03:01:19.910 --> 03:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
a mentally ill homeless person who's
 
03:01:21.349 --> 03:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
unlikely to follow through without
 
03:01:24.870 --> 03:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
appointment which is why we would be
 
03:01:26.990 --> 03:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
asally why the person's perhaps in the
 
03:01:29.469 --> 03:01:29.479 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system to begin with
 
03:01:33.630 --> 03:01:33.640 align:start position:0%
and uh interesting okay thank you we'll
 
03:01:34.990 --> 03:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
look there certainly is a statute that
 
03:01:37.110 --> 03:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
exists yeah it seems like the maybe
 
03:01:39.550 --> 03:01:39.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps direction to the DHHS that they
 
03:01:42.710 --> 03:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
order said person report to a hospital
 
03:01:44.510 --> 03:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
or wherever where such screening could
 
03:01:46.510 --> 03:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
be carried out well they would make that
 
03:01:47.790 --> 03:01:47.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the court the court
 
03:01:49.070 --> 03:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
would make the order I meant for the
 
03:01:51.070 --> 03:01:51.080 align:start position:0%
screening portion of right yes yeah and
 
03:01:52.710 --> 03:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
if they have Medicare then the hospital
 
03:01:54.870 --> 03:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
could build Medicare and that wouldn't
 
03:01:56.750 --> 03:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
yeah right we'll look into that thingk
 
03:01:59.229 --> 03:01:59.239 align:start position:0%
you did you have
 
03:02:01.590 --> 03:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
something okay and I the last point I
 
03:02:02.550 --> 03:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
would make is that the new
 
03:02:04.670 --> 03:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
superintendent the Valley Street the
 
03:02:05.990 --> 03:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
house Corrections down in Valley Street
 
03:02:07.790 --> 03:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
was a former superintendent in maram
 
03:02:10.670 --> 03:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
County he's acutely aware of the uh
 
03:02:13.990 --> 03:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
programs that he started in maram County
 
03:02:15.830 --> 03:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh that he's now trying to start down in
 
03:02:18.190 --> 03:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
Valley Street uh I would and I would
 
03:02:20.710 --> 03:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
recommend that uh the committee consider
 
03:02:22.710 --> 03:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
sending an invitation to both of those
 
03:02:24.670 --> 03:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
superintendents uh to see how they've
 
03:02:27.830 --> 03:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
established those programs uh uh how how
 
03:02:30.870 --> 03:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
they work it with baale and release um
 
03:02:32.830 --> 03:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
those invitations have already been
 
03:02:34.790 --> 03:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
extended we look forward to hearing from
 
03:02:36.269 --> 03:02:36.279 align:start position:0%
